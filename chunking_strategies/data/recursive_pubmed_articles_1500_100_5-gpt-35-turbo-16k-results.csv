What are the main drawbacks of calcium-ion-cross-linked alginate (ca-alginate) as a culture substrate for cells?,Calcium-ion-cross-linked alginate (ca-alginate) is known to be an unfavorable culture substrate for cells due to poor protein adsorptive capacity.,The main drawbacks of calcium-ion-cross-linked alginate (ca-alginate) as a culture substrate for cells are poor cell compatibility and loss of mechanical strength during culture.,"['in tissue engineering research , it is necessary to develop effective culture substrates for cells to facilitate regeneration of deficient tissue .\nit has been shown that the environment surrounding cells has a significant effect on cell behavior .\nthe physical conditions of any scaffold to which cells adhere are an important determinant of cell growth [ 16 ] , along with biochemical signals .\ncells receive various types of information from the culture substrate , such as surface stiffness [ 14 ] or roughness [ 5 , 6 ] .\ntherefore , a good understanding of the relationship between cellular behavior and the physical characteristics of culture substrates is critical for development of effective scaffolds that allow suitable cell adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation . in a previous study\n, we demonstrated that ferric -

"What was the 'English malady' referred to in the 17th century, and what social changes coincided with its symptom changes?","The 'English malady' referred to depression, which became an epidemic in 17th-century England. The symptom changes from psychosomatic to low self-esteem, feelings of guilt, and helplessness coincided with profound social upheaval during the industrialization in textile manufacturing and the shift from extended family structures to individual responsibility in society.",The 'English malady' referred to depression in the 17th century. The social changes that coincided with its symptom changes were the end of the extended family structure in the rural world and the emphasis on individual responsibility in the new society.,"['our investigation started from h. b. murphy \'s hypothesis . in the 1970s he performed an historical analysis of the descriptions of depression found in europe , collecting mostly the contributions of physicians and members of the clergy over a period of some centuries . according to murphy , the symptomatology characterized by low self - esteem , feelings of guilt and helplessness supposedly arose "" epidemically "" in a specific area of 17th - century england .\nthe phenomenon was already known at the time and was defined as the "" english malady "" .\nprior to that time the ( rare ) descriptions of depression had concentrated on a psychosomatic symptomatology and in particular on symptoms of tiredness and loss of hope .  \nthe changes in symptoms coincided with a period of profound social upheaval : the geographical area was that in which the first historical form of industrialization was taking place in textile manufacturing . the social change supposedly took place on two interacting levels .\nfirstly , the rhythms of industrial work marked the end of the extended family typical of the rural world .\nthis was followed by the loss of the close identification of individuals with their group or family and the impossibility of maintaining the close emotive relationship that the extended family could provide .\nthe emphasis of the new society on individual responsibility was to represent the other decisive element .', 'a statistical analysis of the distribution of the specific symptoms revealed more frequent "" psychosomatic "" symptoms ( headaches , lack of appetite , poor digestion ) , excessive tiredness , loss of interest and difficulty in concentrating , ideas of devaluation , conviction that others did not acknowledge the importance of their roles and that an insult by someone may have caused the problems .\nthey thus showed a tendency to suffer from a lack of respect by others and to localize externally the causes of their malaise .\nthe dressmakers more often felt tense , nervous and worried ; they experienced sensations of uselessness and more frequently expressed a wish to die .\nmore than in the control groups , problems involving self - esteem and the more conventional symptoms of depression emerged .\nsome interesting psychosocial studies suggest that cultural transmission tends to remain when the specific cultural institutions ( in the case of the namwera study the occupational role ) are perceived by the persons involved ( and by the other members of the group ) as an integral part of their own personal identity , but at the same time as capable of responding to new exigencies and needs ( "" the evolving self "" ) . in the case of the namwera study\nthis interpretation would explain the absence of external and internal conflicts connected with the new role and , consequently , the nurses \' in integrating into it .', 'the cultural change would thus offer opportunities for success of individuals who are "" desperate , explorative and super - responsible "" ( with "" compulsive hyper - responsibilization "" in bowlbian terms )   while in other circumstances "" unperturbed "" by the change , they would probably be destined to undergo social humiliation .\nthe social change from an evolutionary standpoint may also form the substrate that favours , selects and amplifies the frequency of behaviour of this kind . at the same time , this exposes to decompensation : the step may be rewarded , but those who take it are more at risk : they are alone on a new road and do not have the support of the group , which no longer recognizes them and tends to isolate them .\nthe model may explain not only the transformation of the symptoms ( centred on responsibility and guilt ) but also the supposed increase in depression in western society .\nthe supposed increase in depression in western societies can not in fact be explained by "" ingenuous "" biological and genetic hypotheses : it is irrational if not interpreted from a complex socio - biological standpoint .\nif depression were simply caused by genetic vulnerability we could not explain why a condition that afflicts persons who live shorter lives and give birth to fewer children does not disappear , but according to some has seen a continuous increase from the 17th century to the present .', 'this paper is the report on and balance of some thirty years of transcultural research on mood disorders .  \nthe aim of our work was to produce a hypothesis bringing together the different ways in which discomfort manifests itself , with special emphasis on discomfort viewed through mood symptoms .\nour goal was to see if behaviours defined as pathological and which produced maladjustment in the patient in determined contexts may produce adaptive effects in different contexts and , thanks to attenuated expressions , find in these circumstances the conditions for replication and thus become factors leading to social change .\nwe searched for an interpretation of interactions between environment and behaviours , not from a simplistic perspective that interprets the modalities through which discomfort is expressed as the product of a culture , but by applying an evolutionary approach to see if certain behaviour patterns can be selected from the changing context ( since a static context would not modify the social significance of such patterns ) and finally to see if the very same behaviours can contribute to influencing the environment . in the case of mood disorders , this amounts to seeing how specific milieus can be adaptive for persons with temperaments or "" subthreshold "" depressive and/or expansive hyperergic symptoms .', 'the pervasiveness of depression clearly appears to be decreasing in the last twenty years and , at least in the last ten years , the comparison with the first investigation needs to be considered with more caution in the light of the different interviewing method used and the fact that the diagnostic system had changed . in the ten years preceding the first study the area had seen a 50% decrease in the population in forty years .\nwe have asked ourselves whether this decrease against the general trend has been caused by selective migration , that is , the departure of persons who were in some way "" vulnerable "" to depression .\na certain popular literature has underscored that migration may select persons with "" hypomanic temperaments "" .\ngartner , in his book  the link between ( a little ) craziness and ( a lot of ) success in america    advances the hypothesis that success in america is due to immigrants who are more ambitious , determined , creative and resistant to frustration than others .\nthe author , a psychiatrist well -

"According to the research findings, why might the prevalence of depression in western societies not be fully explained by biological and genetic factors?","The prevalence of depression in western societies cannot be fully explained by biological and genetic factors alone because it does not account for why a condition that shortens lives and reduces reproductive success has not disappeared.

What is anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and how does it typically progress?,"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an acute, immune-mediated paraneoplastic syndrome that typically begins with a flu-like illness and progresses to behavior changes, psychosis, memory deficit, dyskinesia, seizure attacks, deteriorated consciousness level, and autonomic instability.","Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an acute, immune-mediated paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by a prodrome of flu-like illness followed by behavior changes, psychosis, and memory deficit. The typical progression of the disease involves eight categories of symptoms, in decreasing order of prevalence: acute behavioral or cognitive change, movement disorder, memory deficit, speech disorder, seizure, decreased level of consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, and central hypoventilation. These symptoms may appear gradually and resolve in reverse order. The presence of NMDA receptor antibodies in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid or serum confirms the diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The disease severity can vary, and milder symptoms, no need for intensive care, early immunotherapy, and prompt tumor removal are associated with a better prognosis.

What is the primary subject of the study discussed in the article?,"The study discussed in the article primarily focuses on differences in the frequency and severity of acute chorioamnionitis (CAM) and villitis in placentas from stillborn neonates compared with liveborn controls at term, as well as other risk factors and placental findings related to stillbirth.",The primary subject of the study discussed in the article is the integration of clinical judgment into nursing curriculum and continuing education programs.,"['participants were randomly assigned to small groups ( of 68 parent - child dyads ) that met as a group throughout the study period . at each session , participants were assigned small group activities to practice the skills they needed to apply the information taught ( e.g. , how to choose appropriate portion sizes ; how to be active with children ; how to monitor screen time ) .\nleadership roles were rotated through the group with the intention of increasing perceptions of group cohesion . to guard against differential drop out between intervention and control groups\n, we offered a brief school readiness program as an alternative to the active intervention .\nparticipants met in groups of 812 at 3 times for 60  minutes over the 12-week study period .\n( comment and wait , ask questions and wait , and respond by adding more ) , an empirically tested curriculum which teaches parents to read picture books with their children .\nthe sessions were didactic and conducted in spanish by the same facilitator who conducted the intervention sessions .  \ntransportation and childcare for siblings were provided to all study participants to overcome the most frequently cited barriers to study participation .\nparticipants received three small incentives after each wave of data collection ( e.g. , cutting board ) , totaling $ 60 per parent - child dyad .', 'finally , the study findings revealed that participants employed different strategies for clinical judgment development .\nthese strategies constituted the core category of the study , which was  struggling for becoming professional .\nto the best of our knowledge , none of the previous studies explored the process of professionalization in clinical judgment .\nhowever , several studies have reported on some of the properties and strategies of professionalization in clinical judgment ( 12 , 13 ) .\nfurther studies are needed to fully understand the process of professionalization in clinical judgment development .\ninvestigating the effectiveness of integrating clinical judgment into nursing curriculum and continuing education programs is also recommended .\nwe strived to manage our experiences and viewpoints by  drawing on personal experiences ; however , these may affect our approach towards data collection methods and appropriate analysis .\non the other hand , the sincere cooperation of the participants was a strong point of this study .', 'some studies appear to demonstrate it : the swedish study repeated over time by lundby ; the analysis of data of the national study in the united states conducted in the 1980s which , however , is a cross - sectional study ; a study at the general practitioner level in the united kingdom covering about thirty years . however , there are studies that do not appear to confirm this trend , such as the well - known study repeated over time in stirling county , nova scotia [ 35 , 36 ] .\nmore recently , the two studies performed on a population sample in the united states ( of what first evaluation in 1992 and repeated in 2002 ) , and the australian study in new south wales ( first evaluation in 1998 and repeated in 2008 ) , appear undoubtedly to confirm the hypothesis of an increase in the prevalence and incidence of depression at least in the last few decades .\nsardinians , apparently , go in the opposite direction : this emerges from the data of our latest study performed in a sardinian mining district with three estimates of the frequency of depression in the overall population in 1988 , 1998 and 2008 .', 'finally , in this process it is assumed that actors have the possibility of forming new ties , maintaining ties , or dropping existing ties .\nwe treated bmi as a constant covariate and controlled for several commonly observed tendencies in network dynamics : outdegree , reciprocity , and transitivity ( definitions of terms noted in table 2 ) . in two separate models , we tested ( a ) whether parents tend to form ties with other parents who have a similar bmi , and ( b ) whether parents tend to form ties with other parents who have children with a similar bmi .\napproximately 6 weeks passed between baseline data collection and the first intervention and control sessions , and in this time 14 randomized participants dropped from the study pool leaving a sample of 92 dyads exposed to intervention or control conditions ( figure 1 ) . as figure 1 shows , the attrition rate from initial exposure to 3-month followup was lower in the control group ( 15% ) than in the intervention group ( 36% ) .\nthere were no significant demographic or anthropometric differences at baseline between dyads who completed the 3-month follow - up data collection ( n = 75 ) and randomized participants who did not finish the study ( n = 27 ; results available upon request ) . among the 35 dyads in the intervention group for which we have 3-month data , the median number of sessions attended was 7 out of the 12 offered .', 'it is also important to note that the lack of increase in the prevalence of risk factors such as low ldl and impaired fasting glucose with increasing sat among the obese may be due to a threshold effect , whereby risk factor prevalence is already so high that increasing sat is not associated with further increases in prevalence .\ncompared with previous work on subcutaneous fat and cardiometabolic risk , the strengths of the present study include a large sample size with a wide range of bmi and age , thereby reducing the likelihood of ascertainment bias in the results .\nin addition , the study benefits from the quantification of fat volumes from ct scans rather than a single - slice measurement of fat area .\na major limitation of the study is its lack of data on subcutaneous fat stores aside from the abdomen ; therefore , we can not generalize our findings to gluteofemoral fat .\nfurther , we are unable to separate deep versus superficial sat in the abdomen . it may be that superficial sat is less pathogenic than deep sat ( 25 ) .\nin addition , analysis by vat and sat tertiles increases the number of statistical tests performed , increasing the likelihood of false - positive results at the p < 0.05 significance level .']"

What explanation does the article provide for the observed reduced mortality rate among patients with a supratherapeutic INR due to warfarin use?,"The reduced mortality may have been due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions, which could be more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation, or due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.",The article suggests that the reduced mortality rate among patients with a supratherapeutic INR due to warfarin use may be due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions. The bleeding is more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitor infusion. Another possible explanation is a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.,"['reduced mortality may have been due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions , with such bleeding more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitor infusion .\nalternatively , the lower mortality rate may have been due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin .', 'reduction in myocardial infarction due to warfarin - induced anticoagulation could be an alternative explanation for the observed difference in mortality .\nfactor x inhibitors ( rivaroxaban , apixaban ) and direct thrombin inhibitors ( dabigatran ) have been shown to be effective in the prophylaxis of stroke in atrial fibrillation , and in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n 21 \n 22 .\nis the lower mortality in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with warfarin use that we have observed likely to translate to patients taking these medications ?\na major concern with factor x inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors is that in the event of acute hemorrhage , they are not readily reversible .\ncurrent therapeutic options in the setting of life - threatening bleeding include hemodialysis to remove the drug ( dabigatran ) , the administration of prothrombinex ( rivaroxiban , apixaban ) , or the administration of activated factor viia ( all ) .\nthere is little published experience of the clinical efficacy of these strategies , and the normalization of anticoagulation for factor x and direct thrombin inhibitors may depend on unassisted metabolism of the drug .\nserum half - lives vary from 10 to15 hours 17 \n 19 \n 23 , a delay that may be significant in the context of an acute bleed\n.   published randomized trials comparing factor x and direct thrombin inhibitors with warfarin did not specify a rate of mortality due to gastrointestinal bleeding 16', '17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n 21 .\nrates of major gastrointestinal bleeding were higher for all of these agents when compared with warfarin ; however , mortality from bleeding was lower primarily because of a reduced rate of fatal intracranial hemorrhage .\nas clinical experience accumulates for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with the use of factor x inhibitors or direct thrombin inhibitors , the outcome of these patients will become clearer . because it is retrospective in nature , this analysis is subject to potential sources of bias .\nthe most important of these is that the inclusion of patients in the study was subject to the performance of endoscopy , and the threshold for performing endoscopy may have differed between patients taking warfarin and those not taking warfarin . however , the proportion of patients receiving blood transfusion , and the clinical and laboratory parameters suggestive of heavy bleeding at presentation ( serum urea and hemoglobin levels , pulse rate , and blood pressure ) , were similar between the sa patients and those in the control group , suggesting that the severity of bleeding was similar in the two groups .\ndespite high levels of comorbidity , which are known to predict a poor outcome , a supratherapeutic inr at presentation due to warfarin use was associated with reduced mortality in patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage .', 'patients taking warfarin typically have significant comorbidity , often related to the indication for which their warfarin was prescribed .\ncomorbidity is known to be associated with increased mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 3 .\nprevious studies have not adjusted for comorbidity when analysing the outcome of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users , and therefore they may have overestimated the association between mortality and warfarin use 4 \n 5 .  \nthe coagulopathy induced by warfarin is readily reversible , providing a treatment strategy that may improve outcome .\nthis effect is likely to be most apparent in patients taking warfarin who have a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio ( inr ) .\nthis analysis compares 30-day mortality from upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users with a supratherapeutic inr and 30-day mortality in non   \nwarfarin users , adjusting for potential confounding by matching to a control group for variables known to influence survival in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage .', 'this retrospective , observational case - control analysis demonstrates that a supratherapeutic inr at presentation is associated with a reduced mortality rate among patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage when control for comorbidity is implemented .\npatients were well matched for the variables associated with mortality in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 3 \n 11 , although there was a trend toward higher rates of comorbidity , higher blood urea levels , and lower hemoglobin concentrations in the sa group .  \nthe 30-day mortality rate of 15.5  % in the control group was significantly higher than most published figures for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and higher than the overall rate of 9.2  % for the patients in our study 12 \n 13 \n 14 \n 15 .\nthis is a reflection of the degree of comorbidity in the control group of patients , in whom the mean pre - endoscopy rockall score was 3.89 .\nthis is comparable to the mortality rate observed in the original rockall cohort ( pre - endoscopy rockall scores of 3 and 4 , 30-day mortality rates of 11  % and 24.6  % , respectively ) 3 .  \nanticoagulation was reversed at presentation in the majority of sa patients , and an inr of less than 1.5 was achieved within 24 hours in 59 of 128 patients .']"

How does nadph oxidase contribute to the pathophysiology of septic endothelium?,Nadph oxidase contributes to the pathophysiology of septic endothelium by synthesizing intracellular superoxide and initiating oxidative and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells.,"Activation of nadph oxidase during sepsis induces oxidative and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells, leading to redox signaling effects, induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and production of peroxynitrite.

This ultimately leads to organ dysfunction in septic endothelium.","['the cells respond to this septic insult by activating endothelial nadph oxidases that synthesize intracellular superoxide . indeed , nadph oxidase activity is the principal source for stimulated production of superoxide in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to septic insult [ 3638 ] .\nfor example , in microvascular endothelial cell cultures , septic insult ( lps and ifn in combination ; lps  +  ifn ) increases superoxide levels within 2  h .\nnadph oxidase evidently is the principal source because the rise in superoxide levels is abolished by nadph oxidase inhibitors ( apocynin and diphenylene iodonium ) but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration ( rotenone ) , xanthine oxidase ( allopurinol ) or nos ( l - name ) .\nlonger incubation ( 12  h ) with lps  +  ifn increases nadph oxidase activity and nadph oxidase protein expression .\nincreases in intracellular ros , whether caused by acute stimulation of nadph oxidase or by entry of extracellular ros , induce the expression of nadph oxidase subunits that subsequently assemble and produce more ros .\ndismutation of superoxide forms hydrogen peroxide and nitration of superoxide forms peroxynitrite . compared to superoxide ,\nboth hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite are strong oxidants and the latter is also a nitrosative stressor .\nthus , activation of nadph oxidase during sepsis induces oxidative and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells .', 'the oxidants that arise from nadph oxidase activity ( e.g. , hydrogen peroxide formed by dismutation of superoxide ) exert prolonged redox signaling effects that enhance induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) in septic blood vessels and endothelial cells [ 33 , 37 , 52 , 5557 ] .\ninos synthesizes abundant nitric oxide that in turn reacts with superoxide resulting in an excess production of peroxynitrite .\nfor instance , inos expression in omental arteries of septic patients is associated with a subnormal arteriolar response to norepinephrine that can be normalized by the non - selective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) .\nin addition , expression of the vascular adhesion molecule , e - selectin ( a marker of vascular pro - inflammatory phenotype ) is significantly abridged in the organs of inos - deficient mice challenged with lps ( fig .  2 ) .\nimportant to note , that interfering with production of peroxynitrite by pretreating cultured endothelial cells with the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron [ iii ] ( fetpps ) also reduces activation of nuclear factor nfb and subsequent up - regulation of nfb - dependent expression of e - selectin ( fig . \nthe oxidants produced in endothelial cells during sepsis also induce expression of tissue factor [ 30 , 60 ] . this transmembrane glycoprotein ( formerly known as thromboplastin )', 'further , ros activate intracellular redox signaling pathways to increase adhesion of leukocytes , platelets and red blood cells to the endothelium and thereby precipitate capillary blood flow cessation [ 4446 ] . increased permeability of the endothelium occurs in multiple organs during sepsis , leading to plasma extravasation and edema formation .\nthis causes loss of blood volume and progression of septic shock ( i.e. , severe sepsis with hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation ) . basal nitric oxide production by enos is necessary for maintenance of the endothelial barrier function [ 4850 ] .\nthe protective effect of nitric oxide is diminished during the inflammatory response due to the simultaneous production of superoxide .\nthe source of this superoxide is likely the nadph oxidase that is co - localized with enos in subcellular compartments within endothelial cells . indeed , there is experimental evidence that nadph oxidase - derived ros mediate endothelial barrier failure .\nthe latter causes lipid peroxidation , oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and nitration of tyrosine residues .\nin particular , nitration of cytoskeletal proteins by peroxynitrite appears to be a key step for endothelial barrier dysfunction [ 53 , 54 ] .', 'it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ;

What does the presence of specific IgE against Anisakis simplex indicate in the context of the study?,"The presence of specific IgE against Anisakis simplex indicates a past infection by the parasite, which is always self-limiting and therefore acute.","The presence of specific IgE against Anisakis simplex indicates a sensitivity or allergic response to the parasite in both patients with acute urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis (GAA) and patients with chronic urticaria (CU+).","['anisakis simplex is a fish parasite of worldwide distribution , whose third stage larva can be present in a huge number of marine teleost fishes .\nhumans can therefore be accidental hosts by consuming crude or undercooked fish . whereas ige production is an evolutionary - maintained immunologic feature in mammals and\nthus can also be verified in all cases of human parasitic forms by this nematode , the allergenic potential has been an emerging health concern in the last years , giving rise to a large number of studies searching for proteins able to stimulate a specific ige response [ 2 , 3 ] .\ngastroallergic anisakiasis has been described as a differential entity , where an acute parasitism by a. simplex produces also a clinically relevant ige - mediated hypersensitivity reaction with appearance of acute urticaria , angioedema , or anaphylaxis .\nit is well known that , in gaa , specific as well as total ige and other specific immunoglobulin isotype levels depend upon the time interval elapsed ( ti ) between the acute parasitic episode and the obtaining of the serum sample .\nthe parasite is not adapted to the human environment and neither survives nor moults to its final stage .', 'this knowledge has led to studies differentiating acute from chronic infections [ 1721 ] .  \ntherefore , one approach to get more insight into the clinical relevance of specific ige and igg in a. simplex - associated allergic diseases is to assess hypothesized differences in avidity in gaa and cu+ and to associate them with the time interval elapsed since the parasitic episode and also with fish - eating habits as a possible correlation to the probability of previous subclinical parasitic episodes .\npatients were recruited at our allergy service and included prospectively if they matched the inclusion criteria .\nall patients had to display a positive spt and detectable ige antibodies against a. simplex at 0.7  ku / l .\ngaa patients had an acute episode of acute urticaria , angioedema , or anaphylaxis of less than 48-hour duration within 24 hours after eating raw or clearly undercooked fish , and other eliciting causes have been discarded by history and allergological workup .\ncu+ patients were included if they had at least twice per week recurring wheals for at least 6 weeks .\npatients were not included in this study if physical stimuli were the main eliciting agents of the urticarial reaction .\nother factors associated with cu were not an exclusion factor , as cu is mainly multifactorial .\nthus 16 patients with gaa and 17 patients with cu+ were included and questioned about weekly fish and monthly anchovies in vinegar sauce consumption .', 'otherwise this possibility has been stated unlikely because very high levels of ige are needed to adequately saturate ige receptors .\nalso in this case we could speculate that , once a sensitization process has occurred , following continuous contact with anisakis proteins of other specificities than those leading to the allergic episode , leads to maintaining lower affinity antibodies .\nthis would be an explanation to the fact that patients sensitized to anisakis do not react with acute type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in provocation tests with non viable anisakis larvae [ 28 , 29 ] .\nfurthermore , blocking antibodies , such as igg4 included in the igg compartment , with confirmed higher avidities in gaa could , by competing with the same epitopes recognized by ige , prevent mast cell activation and the subsequent allergic episode , when anisakis contaminated fish ( nonviable or inactivated larvae ) is well tolerated by patients with previous gaa .  \ninterestingly , if we look at the diverging correlation of avigg and avige with specific ige , we can also postulate that avidity is not only the outcome of an affinity maturation process of antibodies within an antibody isotype , but also the outcome of a mechanism , in which probably outcompeting of an immunoglobulin isotype over another could have been resulted by high - affinity antibodies in the maturation process .', 'we have no data on avidities after a primary infection with a. simplex in humans , as these are expected to behave subclinically or induce only gastrointestinal , but no allergic symptoms .\nit may be argued that in gaa at least two episodes , as proposed above , would be sufficient to induce in the second episode a higher maturation of antibodies in the context of a secondary response , but the otherwise longer time interval in cu+ could be responsible for the slightly higher ige avidities .   whereas avidity describes the overall strength of the interaction between antibodies and their antigens , it would therefore be interesting to perform a similar study analysing affinities to already known anisakis proteins or allergens .\nour avidity results could be interpreted as a subset of clinically relevant ige for the acute parasitism and a set of ige antibodies induced by continuous fish intake ( and therefore anisakis contact ) with possibly different avidities . in this respect ,\na previous study in peanut allergic subjects showed ige  :  igg avidity ratios to be higher than 1 for a total antigenic source , whereas the opposite ratio was found when analysing avidity to a major allergen ara h2 . in our present study\nall but one patient showed a higher avige than avigg ( avige / avigg ratio > 1 ; data not shown ) , a fact that does not rule out opposite findings if we would have available affinity studies with known allergens .', 'further time interval was defined as the interval between serum sample and gaa episode or onset of cu symptoms .\nanti -

and the rituals which elaborated different forms of capital penalty , as well as the different forms of corporal penalty such as branding , pillorying and so on , strike us , for good reason , as deeply inhumane .\nmoreover the idea of punishment before the public gaze  a key condition for the diffusion of shared perceptions of symbolic equivalence  is now regarded as fundamentally uncivilised .\nbut it is worth remembering that the world view from which these penal practices proceeded was one in which the symbols of state and penal authority formed part of a broader cosmology of authority and right , itself often bound up with claims about divine or traditional legitimation , and one which commanded respect well beyond the elite .']"
What contributed to the erosion of the historical effectiveness of retributive punishments?,"The erosion of the historical effectiveness of retributive punishments is attributed to the decline in early modern symbols of equivalence, the rationalisation and modernisation of retributivism, and the growth of sentiments opposed to public displays of violence.","The erosion of the historical effectiveness of retributive punishments can be attributed to the attempted rationalization and modernization of retributivism, as exemplified by Beccaria's philosophy. There was a growing recognition that punishment required abstract moral justification, which disrupted the simple symbolism of equivalence expressed through physical punishments. Additionally, the recognition that desert is not only based on the offender's misconduct or bad character, but also on the degree of the offender's responsibility, further disrupted the symbolism of equivalence. Religious overtones to punishment as a form of atonement also persisted.","['but the declining self - evidence of the ancien rgime in punishment may , ironically , also have had to do with the attempted rationalisation and modernisation of retributivism which beccaria s ( and kant s ) philosophy exemplified , with the growing acceptance that punishment required abstract moral justification itself a reaction to the declining force of early modern symbols of equivalence largely expressed through physical punishments . in particular , the recognition that desert is calibrated not only with the offender s misconduct or manifested bad character but , importantly and additionally , with the degree of the offender s responsibility , disrupted any simple symbolism of equivalence .\nthis was not , of course , in the nature of a clean break from retributivism to utilitarianism ; in particular , religious overtones to punishment as a form of atonement persisted .\npenitentiary , and early prison regimes were strongly focused on encouraging the offender to reflect on his or her wrongdoing and come to a state of repentance \nan idea which it was possible to bring into conformity with the utilitarian goals of discipline and reformation which were becoming so influential .\nconversely , many pre - modern penalties  branding and whipping for example  must surely have had incapacitative and deterrent rationales and effects alongside their retributive foundations .', 'but the very different impact of the justice model in different countries raises important questions about the cultural , political , social and institutional conditions under which the retributive revival invites an escalation of insatiable affective blame , and those under which it fosters  or can be made consistent with \nit raises questions , in short , about the cultural and institutional arrangements which can make the metaphor of proportionality meaningful , and punishment accordingly limited in real terms .\nin addressing these questions , a useful place to start is by looking at certain features of the penal systems which predated the modern push towards consequentialism in punishment , or which continue to exist in parts of the world whose penal practices were less decisively affected by the processes of modernisation and democratisation which swept europe and the united states in the 18 and 19 centuries . in many of their earlier forms , retributive ideas related to wider frameworks of social and ethical meaning which underpinned prevailing social and political systems and institutional practices\n an environment which had fundamentally changed by the time attempts were made , in the 1970s , to revive and realise retributive ideas .\nan effort to understand the nature of the lost cosmology which leant meaning to early modern punishments  impressionistic as it must be within the confines of a single paper', ', the commitment to just deserts all too easily produces insatiable demands for hard treatment .\ndesert theorists believed that retributivism could provide a limit to punishment by restricting its moral justification to the past - oriented criterion of proportionality with the seriousness of an offence .\nthat its credentials on the first criterion are dismal is not surprising given that our prevailing culture is no longer premised on widely shared belief in a moral order structured around notions of desert or appropriateness grounded in widely shared symbols of equivalence . but this sobering analytic conclusion should not , in our view , be interpreted as a counsel of despair .\nfew proponents of the justice model would want to recreate the hierarchical and authoritarian conditions which made retributive punishments such as the lex talionis meaningful to contemporaries , and religious affiliations and symbols of the sacred can not be organised in democratic societies by processes of deliberate institutional reform , even should they seem attractive .\nthe task , rather , is to consider what early modern societies can tell us about the links between the legitimation of punishment and broader social conditions ; to reflect on the theoretical and practical resources which resonate with modern moral and political discourse ; and to ponder how best they may be institutionalised under particular conditions .', 'the articulated justification  or perhaps we should say rationalisation  of punishment in western countries over the past two hundred and fifty years has followed a relatively clear , and widely discussed , trajectory . to sketch this historical story only crudely : the early modern retributive corporal penalties gradually gave way , from the late 18 century , as a \ncivilising process issued in a preference for less overtly violent , and less publically visible , forms of sanctioning . by the same token ,\na demand arose for the highly discretionary forms of power , through which early modern penalties were typically delivered , to be rationalised and regularised as a result of the gradual modernisation and democratisation of the hierarchical forms of political authority from which they emanated .\nbeccaria and bentham are , with good reason , thought of as the key figures in this modernisation of the rationale of punishment , though beccaria is of particular importance in that his work stands as an important modern source of both of the two main ideas which have coincided and competed with one another as justifications of state punishment .', 'the question of what shapes the balance between retaliation and reconciliation has long been recognised by sociologists , anthropologists and criminologists as a crucial question about punishment . even those who , like g. h. mead , see desert as the basic reason for punishment , and the expression of vengeance and affective blame as socially useful , acknowledge that these generate no stable criteria for the level of punishment , and so inevitably carry the risks of the escalation of aggression and of the stigmatisation of offenders . as mead put it :  we see society almost helpless in the grip of the hostile attitude it has taken towards those who break its laws and contravene its institutions ; and , in a passage reminiscent of durkheim ;  hence  the attitude of hostility , either against the transgressor of the laws or against the external enemy , gives to the group a sense of solidarity  which consumes the differences of individual interests , the price paid for this solidarity of feeling is great and at times disastrous. in the sway of these powerful emotional dynamics  recently seen perhaps most vividly , among advanced democracies , in the united states \nappeals to proportionality are little more than empty rhetoric . what is needed , rather , is an understanding of the institutional conditions which can structure the dynamics of collective action so as to inhibit the slide into stigmatisation and othering , and foster the reconciliatory dispositions .']"

5 years after colonoscopy and did not specifically focus on a complete negative colonoscopy ( i.e. , a colonoscopy with no detection of adenoma ) . to overcome these limitations ,\na population - based study was performed in germany using the definition of interval cancer as a crc occurring within 10 years after a complete negative colonoscopy.21 using this 10-year definition , 4.0% of interval cancers were identified among 1,945 crc cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 . to interpret the large variation in the prevalence of interval cancer , several factors', 'the problem of the so -

"What is the major limitation associated with colonoscopy, as suggested by the National Polyp Study and several other studies?","Colonoscopy is associated with only a 37 - 65% reduction in mortality from CRC, which is much lower than previously reported, highlighting a limitation especially in the right-sided colon.","The major limitation associated with colonoscopy, as suggested by the National Polyp Study and several other studies, is the limited effectiveness of colonoscopic prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC), especially in the right-sided colon.","['colonoscopists are encouraged to reduce their risk by documenting the limitations of colonoscopy in the informed consent process and their data of colonoscopy quality ( e.g. , cecal intubation , bowel preparation , and withdrawal time ) .\ncolonoscopists commonly discuss the complications of the procedure ; however , they seldom discuss the possibility of missed lesions and failure to prevent interval cancers.16 colonoscopy is not considered a perfect method by colonoscopists or by patients .\ninformed consent may shift the burden of this reality from the colonoscopists to the patients .\nmaintenance of an adequate level of colonoscopy quality indicators and detection of non -

polypoid lesions , which have a subtle endoscopic appearance , may be more easily missed , especially by endoscopists with lower adr and in inadequate bowel preparations.13 previous several studies showed that non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers share some common features:15,19,35,36 both lesions are common in the proximal colon,15,19,35 and interval cancers have a flat appearance.36 although the relationship between non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers has not yet been clarified , endoscopists should be careful not to miss non - polypoid lesions during colonoscopy , especially in the right - sided colon .', 'the incidence of colorectal cancer ( crc ) in korea has been markedly increasing in recent years .\nthis epidemiologic change in korea requires an increasing number of colonoscopies , which are highly effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of crc.1,2,3 colonoscopy is currently regarded as the gold standard and preferred screening method for crc .\nhowever , evidence suggests that colonoscopy is not as sensitive for the detection of neoplasia as previously believed , as demonstrated in studies analyzing the effectiveness of tandem colonoscopy and ct colonography.4,5 a systemic review of six studies on tandem colonoscopy showed that the pooled miss rate for polyps of any size was 22%.4 using ct colonography as a reference standard , the miss rate of conventional colonoscopy for a large adenoma ( 10 mm ) was 12%.5 as a result , a significant number of colorectal neoplasias , including cancers , may be missed , even by experienced endoscopists .\nmoreover , results from the national polyp study and several other studies6,7,8 suggested that colonoscopy is associated with only a 37 - 65% reduction in mortality from crc , which is much lower than that reported previously . this could be attributed to the limited effectiveness of colonoscopic prevention of crc , especially in the right - sided colon . therefore , the role and limitations of colonoscopic screening must be carefully reconsidered .', 'first , precancerous or cancerous lesions may have been missed at the time of colonoscopy.30 withdrawal time and technique deserve special consideration in this context , as the detection rate of colorectal neoplasia depends on the withdrawal time during colonoscopy .\nbarclay et al.31 demonstrated that a withdrawal time 6 min is strongly correlated with an increased adenoma detection rate ( adr ) .\nin addition , careful inspection of the oral side of the mucosal folds is more important than simple adherence to a standard withdrawal time , especially in the proximal colon.32,33 the adr itself is also an important quality indicator for predicting the risk of interval cancers after screening colonoscopy .\nkaminski et al.17 demonstrated that the adr of endoscopist was significantly associated with the risk of interval cancer ( p=0.008 ) .\nendoscopies with an adr of less than 11.0% were associated with a 10.94-fold ( 95% ci , 1.37 - 87.01 ) higher risk of interval cancer than endoscopies with an adr of 20.0% or higher .', 'rabeneck et al.48 also showed that non - gastroenterologists have a significantly higher rate of missed cancers than gastroenterologists , independent of procedural volume .\nthe lack of an association between colonoscopy volume and missed cancers may indicate that even non - gastroenterologists who handle a high volume of procedures continue to miss more crcs than gastroenterologists .\nit may also indicate that formal endoscopic training generally leads to competency in colonoscopy , whereas providers who do not receive formal training are unable to achieve competence despite the volume of procedures they perform.12,47,48 a higher rate of interval cancers associated with index colonoscopies performed by general practice physicians was also found in studies from ontario and indiana.15,49 emerging evidence suggests a link between endoscopist specialty and colonoscopy quality in korea.50 to the best of our knowledge , there is no formal curriculum or guidelines in colonoscopy training for general practice physicians in korea .\ntherefore , more stringent standards for training and assessment of colonoscopy quality are necessary to cope with the risk of interval cancer .\ngenerally , plaintiffs often allege inadequate performance of colonoscopy as the proximate cause of the interval cancer . to date ,']"
