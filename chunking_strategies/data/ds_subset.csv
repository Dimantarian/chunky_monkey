"participants were employees of the tokyo gas company that supplies natural gas to the tokyo area .
all employees received annual health checkups and completed a health questionnaire in accordance with the industrial safety and health law .
the participants for this study were 5,984 male employees who had participated in an annual health checkup and annual submaximal exercise tests in 1985 . among these men ,
335 were excluded because they were found at the health checkup to have at least one of the following : diabetes ( n = 102 ) , cardiovascular disease including hypertension ( n = 228 ) , tuberculosis ( n = 3 ) , or gastrointestinal disease ( n = 9 ) . for the present study
, we also required participants to have at least four submaximal exercise tests in the previous 7 years ( 19791985 ) .
this excluded 1,462 men , leaving 4,187 men , who were followed until june 1999 for the development of type 2 diabetes .
the initial exercise loads were 600 , 525 , and 450 kilopond meter / min for participants aged 2029 , 3039 , and 4049 years , respectively .
heart rate was calculated from the r - r interval on an electrocardiogram , and 85% of the age - predicted maximal heart rate ( 220  age [ years ] ) was set as the target heart rate .
the exercise load was increased by 225 kilopond meter / min for each stage among all age - groups , until heart rates during the course of the exercise reached the target heart rate or until the completion of the third stage .
maximal oxygen uptake ( vo2max ) was estimated using the strand - ryhming nomogram ( 11 ) and the strand age correction factors ( 12 ) .
first , we used a simple linear regression of vo2max against time to assess the individual regression coefficient ( slope ) of fitness over 7 years .
next , all participants were divided into quartiles based on the slope from their individual model .
the annual health checkup included measurement of height , body weight , and blood pressure and a urinary glucose test .
, participants were followed for the development of type 2 diabetes , which was based on any one of the following three diagnostic parameters : 1 ) plasma glucose levels exceeded 11.1 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl ) 2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test , conducted in men with urinary glucose detected at a follow - up annual health checkup , 2 ) participants themselves reported current therapy with hypoglycemic medication ( insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent ) when they were interviewed at their health checkup , or 3 ) fasting plasma glucose levels were > 7.0
we first compared baseline characteristics of participants according to quartiles of the fitness trend using one - way anova for continuous variables and a  test for categorical variables as appropriate .
we used cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios ( hrs ) of the incidence of type 2 diabetes .
we adjusted for age , initial fitness level ( continuous vo2max ) , bmi ( continuous variable ) , systolic blood pressure ( continuous variable ) , cigarette smoking ( nonsmokers , 120 cigarettes / day , and 21 cigarettes / day ) , alcohol intake ( none , 145 g / day , and 46 g / day ) , and a family history of diabetes ( present or not ) in a multivariate model .
a family history of diabetes was defined as the known presence of family members with diabetes in any of three generations , as determined by self - report on the health questionnaire .
the proportionality assumption of the model was tested using a log - minus - log plot ; no evidence of violation was found .
all analyses were performed using spss 15.0j for windows ( spss , chicago , il ) .

a family history of diabetes was defined as the known presence of family members with diabetes in any of three generations , as determined by self - report on the health questionnaire .
the proportionality assumption of the model was tested using a log - minus - log plot ; no evidence of violation was found .
all analyses were performed using spss 15.0j for windows ( spss , chicago , il ) .
the mean age of the participants was 32.0 years ( range 2240 years ) at baseline .
the mean  sd number of fitness tests during 7 years was 6.0  0.96 .
the time between the first and last fitness test in each single individual was 6.5  0.73 years .
the median follow - up time was 14 years , with a total of 56,749 man - years of observation . during follow - up
there were 42 deaths , and 143 participants were lost to follow - up due to retirement .
men in the lowest fitness trend quartile ( quartile 1 ) decreased their average vo2max from 45.3 to 36.6 ml / kg / min ( median slope 1.25 ml / kg / min ) between 1979 and 1985 , whereas men in the highest fitness trend quartile ( quartile 4 ) increased their average vo2max from 36.3 to 45.6 ml / kg / min ( median slope 1.33 ml / kg / min ) over the same time .
the men in the lowest fitness trend quartile had the highest level of fitness in 1979 , whereas those in the highest fitness trend quartile had the lowest level of fitness .
the men in the highest quartile were more likely to have lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a lower rate of smoking compared with those in the lowest quartile .
baseline characteristics by cardiorespiratory fitness trend data represent median ( range ) , mean sd , or % .
men with higher initial fitness had lower hrs for type 2 diabetes than men in the lower initial fitness group .
in addition , older age , high bmi , high systolic blood pressure , alcohol intake , and a family history of diabetes all significantly increased the risk of type 2 diabetes . adjusted hr for incidence of type 2 diabetes by potential risk factors at baseline ( 1985 ) data are n ( % ) unless otherwise noted . *
table 3 shows the hrs for type 2 diabetes by fitness trend quartiles , with the lowest quartile used as the referent .
there were progressively lower age - adjusted hrs of type 2 diabetes across fitness trend quartiles .
after further adjustment for initial fitness level , bmi , systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , and a family history of diabetes , there remained a strong inverse association between type 2 diabetes risk and fitness trend quartiles ( ptrend < 0.001 ) .
men in the highest quartile of fitness trend had an 70% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with men in the lowest quartile .
hrs of incidence of type 2 diabetes , according to quartiles of cardiorespiratory fitness trend data are means ( range ) unless otherwise indicated . * adjusted for age , initial cardiorespiratory fitness level , bmi , systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , and a family history of diabetes .
we next investigated the hrs of type 2 diabetes associated with quartiles of fitness trend , among men classified according to their initial fitness levels in 1979 .
the inverse gradient for diabetes across long - term trends in fitness categories was generally observed for all levels of fitness in 1979 , except for men in the highest category of initial fitness ( 45.0 ml / kg / min ) .
we also investigated the hrs of type 2 diabetes among men with different levels of bmi at baseline ( 1985 ) .
again , there generally was an inverse gradient for diabetes risk across long - term trends in fitness categories for all bmi categories except the lowest .
hrs for incidence of type 2 diabetes associated with quartiles of cardiorespiratory fitness trend , among men categorized by initial ( 1979 ) cardiorespiratory fitness level ( top ) or baseline ( 1985 ) bmi ( bottom ) .
hrs were adjusted for age , systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , a family history of diabetes , and bmi ( top ) or initial cardiorespiratory fitness level ( bottom ) .
in this study , we prospectively investigated the relationship between long - term trends in fitness and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in nondiabetic japanese men .
there was a strong inverse relationship between long - term trends in fitness and the incidence of type 2 diabetes , with men increasing their fitness over a 7-year period having lower risks than men with decreasing fitness over the same span .
the observed association is biologically plausible , because physical activity or fitness is a strong independent predictor of lower type 2 diabetes incidence rates ( 2,3 ) .
physical activity or fitness may prevent and delay type 2 diabetes by improving glucose levels , reducing adiposity , increasing muscle mass and the glut4 in muscle tissues , and reducing insulin resistance ( 13,14 ) .
the major strength of this study is the objective measurement of fitness , repeated over time .
fitness , an objective marker of daily physical activity , is a stronger predictor of morbidity or mortality than self - reported physical activity ( 15 ) .
terslinna et al . investigated the relationship , among 31 subjects , between measured vo2max and estimated vo2max using the strand - ryhming nomogram and correction factors used in the present study , obtaining a correlation coefficient of 0.92 ( 16 ) .
furthermore , we used values obtained in oral glucose tolerance tests or fasting blood glucose levels as objective measures of the study outcome , type 2 diabetes .
individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes , such as those with impaired glucose tolerance or obesity , have been studied in randomized controlled trials of lifestyle , including physical activity and type 2 diabetes ( 810 ) .
however , there are no data in low - risk populations . in addition , most of the data have been in caucasian subjects .
type 2 diabetes is a global problem ; thus , data are needed not only in high - risk populations but also in low - risk populations and in other racial / ethnic groups .
one limitation of the present study is that subjects may not be representative of the entire japanese population and women were not included .
another limitation is that possible changes in fitness levels were taken into account between 1979 and 1985 but not during the follow - up period , 19851999 .
however , not accounting for changes during the latter period would probably dilute the true association between fitness and the risk of developing diabetes . in conclusion , this cohort study showed a strong inverse relationship between long - term trends in fitness and the development of type 2 diabetes in japanese men .
this relationship was independent of age , initial fitness level , bmi , systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , and a family history of diabetes .
thus , regular physical activity , which is associated with an increase or preservation of fitness , should be promoted by health professionals , because it decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes , in addition to decreasing the risks of many chronic diseases ( 17 ) .","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

"therapeutic proteins and peptides have potential to elicit immune responses [ 1 , 2 ] , resulting in anti - drug antibodies ( adas ) that can pose problems for both patient safety and product efficacy .
clinical consequences can range from relatively mild to serious adverse events [ 35 ] , such as anaphylaxis , cytokine release syndrome , and cross - reactive neutralization of endogenous proteins mediating critical functions .
ada can affect drug efficacy and biodistribution and drug clearance , and complicate the interpretations of toxicity and pharmacokinetic ( pk ) and pharmacodynamic ( pd ) data [ 68 ] . during drug development immunogenicity
is examined by risk - based approach along with specific strategies for developing  fit - for - purpose  bioanalytical approaches .
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) and electrochemiluminescence ( ecl ) immunoassays   are the most widely used platform for ada detection due to their high sensitivity and throughput
. lower affinity ada can be detected by surface plasmon resonance , biolayer interferometry , or other platforms .
typically , detection of ada is followed by assessments of the magnitude ( titer ) of the ada response and the in vitro neutralizing ability of ada , especially in late - stage clinical studies .
additional characterization of ada such as immunoglobulin subclass or isotype determinations , domain - mapping , relative binding affinity , cross - reactivity with endogenous proteins , or complement activating ability of the ada may be driven by product - specific , indication - specific , or risk assessment - based objectives [ 9 , 12 , 13 ] .
recommendations for ada assay development , method validation , and testing strategies have been published by the ligand - binding assay bioanalytical focus group ( lbabfg ) of american association of pharmaceutical scientists ( aaps ) [ 10 , 12 , 1416 ] .
additionally , scientific publications on risk - based approaches to immunogenicity assessments [ 9 , 12 , 1719 ] and regulatory documents from the us food and drug administration ( fda ) and the european medicine agency ( ema ) are also available [ 2023 ] .
together , these documents provide ample guidance for the application of appropriate ada detection methods in clinical studies . since the late 1990s
, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( lc / ms ) has been a dominant tool for sensitive , accurate , and rapid analysis of small - molecule drugs , metabolites , and biomarkers . in recent years
, lc / ms has emerged as a promising platform for quantitation of biotherapeutics and protein biomarkers in biological matrices [ 2527 ] . the vast majority of lc / ms - based protein quantifications are performed at peptide levels , mainly due to consideration of assay sensitivity .
a typical procedure for lc / ms - based quantification includes enzyme digestion and quantification of the target proteins based on selected signature peptides derived from the target [ 29 , 30 ] .
recently , furlong et al . developed a universal peptide method to quantitate human antibody fc region - containing therapeutic protein candidates in nonclinical species .
surrogate tryptic peptide vvsvltvlhqdwlngk for igg1 , igg3 , and igg4 and vvsvltvvhqdwlngk for igg2 were identified in the fc region of human immunoglobulins ( igg ) , respectively .
the method was shown to be capable of supporting bioanalysis of a diversity of human fc region - containing therapeutic protein candidates in plasma samples of all commonly used animal species , thus eliminating the need to develop unique peptide methods for each individual therapeutic candidate . with a similar approach , dongen et al .
achieved a higher sensitivity of 4  ng / ml for a monoclonal ab drug , infliximab , using a different universal peptide ( slslspgk ) from the c - terminal of fc .
used a stable isotope labeled common mab as internal standard for quantitation of therapeutic mab in preclinical samples .
not only was the common whole ab internal standard able to correct for variations from the beginning of sample processing to ionization in the mass spectrometer but also it allowed rapid method development with flexible choice of a suitable surrogate peptide for new applications , such as different species or different mab .
stable isotope labeled human monoclonal ab incorporating [ c6,n4]-arginine and [ c6,n2]-lysine is now commercially available and can be used for the universal peptide methods .
lc / ms has also been reported to assess ada in the presence of excess protein therapeutic in support of clinical programs addressing the safety and tolerability of human growth hormone analogues .
this methodology overcame drug tolerance issues , which are often associated with traditional ada detection [ 3537 ] , by completely saturating available ada binding sites with the addition of excess therapeutic .
drug - ada complexes were then isolated using protein g immobilized on magnetic beads , followed by elution and digestion .
resultant peptide from the target therapeutic proteins was quantified by lc coupled with matrix - assisted laser desorption ms and the results were correlated to the binding capacity of total ada . in another application , lc / ms was used to evaluate neutralizing ab ( nab ) assay by simultaneously quantitating residual mab - drug , endogenous igg , and nab - positive control in bead eluates . in the study ,
the low levels of the residual drug and human igg in the bead eluates indicate that the bead efficiently removed the high concentration drug and serum components from the serum samples .
meanwhile , the nab - positive control recovery ( ~42% ) in the bead provided an acceptable detection limit for the cell - based assay .
this novel application of lc / ms to immunogenicity assay development demonstrates the advantages of lc / ms in selectivity and multiplexing , which provides direct and fast measurements of multiple components .
we describe here an immunocapture - lc / ms - based approach for simultaneous ada isotyping and semiquantitation in human plasma .
biotinylated drug or anti - drug ab is used to capture adas or drug - ada complexes in plasma , respectively . the resulting ada - drug or ada - drug - ab complexes
after washing , ada is released from the beads and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by lc / ms detection of specific universal peptides for each ada isotype .

an aliquot of 95  l of human plasma sample and 5  l of 5.85  m acetic acid were pipetted into a 96 deep - well polypropylene plate .
the plate was incubated with gentle mixing for 1  hr at room temperature . after adding 75  l aliquot of 0.1  mg / ml biotinylated protein z and 40  l of trizma base ( 1.5  m tris , ph 10 ) to each sample ,

the beads were separated , washed three times with 300  l of tbs - t and once with 300  l of water , and then eluted with 150  l of 0.1  m glycine ( ph 2.0 ) on a kingfisher flex bead handler .

five l of a stable labeled internal standard solution of the universal peptides ( 0.2  g / ml ) and 5  l of 50  mm tcep in 100  mm ammonium bicarbonate were added and followed by incubation at room temperature for 20  min . after adding 5  l of 50  mm iodoacetamide in 100  mm ammonium bicarbonate , the plate was gently shaken for 20  min while protected from light .
a 5  l aliquot of solution containing trypsin ( 0.2  mg / ml ) and calcium chloride ( 0.2  m ) , prepared immediately before use , was added to each sample and the plate was incubated at 37c overnight with gentle mixing .
the samples were mixed for 40  min at 37c and then centrifuged at 4400  rpm for 10  min prior to lc / ms analysis .
eksigent ekspert microlc 200 coupled with ab sciex 6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( ab sciex , framingham , ma ) was used .

mobile phases consisted of ( a ) 0.1% formic acid and ( b ) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile running at a flow rate of 60  l / min . for information - dependent acquisition ( ida ) , the lc gradient was 5% to 50% b over 18 minutes . for ada isotyping and semiquantitation ,
the lc gradient was 12% to 17% b over 2.8 minutes and then to 47% b over 6.2 minutes .
key instrument parameters were as follows : + 5000  v electrospray voltage , 65 nebulizer gas units , 30 axillary gas units , 375c ion source temperature , 10 collision gas units , and unit resolution on both q1 and q3 . for identifying unique peptides for each ada isotype with ida ,
up to 4 multiple - reaction - monitoring ( mrm ) pairs were used for screening followed by enhanced product ion scan . for ada isotyping and semiquantitation , 13 mrm pairs of universal peptides
despite its many advantages and potential , the use of lc / ms for protein quantitation is not as straightforward as for small - molecules and oftentimes demands comprehensive method development .
plasma and serum are very complex matrices that contain several hundreds of thousands of proteins and protein isoforms in a wide concentration range . upon digestion
these are all cleaved into multiple peptides , from which just one or a few have to be quantified .
when no protein or peptide purification is employed , lc / ms sensitivity is significantly compromised due to matrix interference from the peptide - rich digest . for high sensitivity lc / ms applications
immunopurification can be done either at the protein - level prior to digestion [ 40 , 41 ] or at the peptide level after digestion .
immunopurification of peptides requires anti - peptide ab for each peptide of interest . unlike proteins , small peptides are usually less or even not immunogenic , which presents significant challenges for anti - peptide ab production
moreover , ada and/or drug - ada complex has to be pulled down prior to digestion and peptide pull - down . in consideration of these factors , we employed protein - level immunopurification for sample preparation .
antibodies are secreted by plasma cells and come in different isotypes with genetic variations or differences in the constant regions of the heavy and light chains . in humans ,
there are five heavy chain isotypes (  : iga ;  : igd ;  : igg ;  : ige ; and  : igm ) and two light chain isotypes (  and  ) .
in addition , igg has 4 subclasses ( igg1 , igg2 , igg3 , and igg4 ) and iga has 2 subclasses ( iga1 and iga2 )
. relative ab abundance ( % total igs ) in human varies significantly among isotypes / subclasses : igg1 ( 65% ) , igg2 ( 25% ) , igg3 ( 5% ) , igg4 ( 5% ) , iga1 , iga2 ( 13% iga1 + iga2 ) , ige ( < 0.003% ) , igm ( 8% ) , and igd ( < 1% ) .
abs can present as soluble and/or membrane - bound on the surface of b cells and only the soluble abs can be found in plasma or serum .
all isotypes can be found in normal serum . among them , igg1igg4 are the most abundant antibody isotypes found in the circulation and provide the majority of antibody - based immunity against invading pathogens .
although ige is the least abundant isotype , it plays an essential role in type i hypersensitivity and allergic conditions [ 45 , 46 ] , such as anaphylactic reactions to certain drugs .
iga is an antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity and is found in small amounts in blood .
igd makes up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of mature b - lymphocytes but only represents about 0.25% of igs in serum and is thus excluded in the immunocapture - lc / ms assay .
ada isotyping and semiquantitation were based on the surrogate peptides of adas instead of whole molecules , mainly in consideration of sensitivity [ 2830 ] .
the semiquantitative measurement relied on the existence of a stoichiometric ( quantitative ) relationship between ada and its surrogate peptide . by far the most critical element of this approach was to identify proper peptide(s ) that were unique to each antibody isotype / subclass .
first of all , the surrogate peptide(s ) to each isotype / subclass must come from the constant region . although adas of the same isotype come in many different forms in terms of amino acid sequence in their variable regions , they all have the same constant region . secondly , the surrogate peptides should be unique to each ada isotype / subclass and should not be formed in any other isotypes .
thirdly , the surrogate peptides should not contain the amino acids of ada allotype polymorphic residues .
peptides that met the three criteria represented a certain ada isotype regardless of differences in ada variable regions , thus allowing ada isotyping and semiquantitation by lc / ms . among the ig isotypes , only igg1igg3 and iga2 have different allotypes . at present , 26 human allotypes are known [ 47 , 48 ] : 6 for igg1 ( g1m1 , g1m2 , g1m3 , g1m17 , g1m27 , and g1m28 ) , 1 for igg2 ( g2m23 ) , 13 for igg3 ( g3m5 , g3m6 , g3m10 , g3m11 , g3m13 , g3m14 , g3m15 , g3m16 , g3m21 , g3m24 , g3m26 , g3m27 , and g3m28 ) , and 3 for iga2 ( a2m1 , a2m2 , and a2m3 ) . in addition , 3 allotypes were found for  light chain ( km1 , km2 , and km3 ) . except for g1m3 and g1m17 located on the ch1 , all heavy chain allotypes are localized on the fc region , either on ch2 or on ch3 .
igg1 heavy gamma chain allotypes differ in amino acid ( aa ) residues at 214 , 356 , 358 , and 431 .
igg3 has the most allotypes , and they differ at aa residues at 291 , 292 , 379 , 384 , 397 , 409 , 419 , 422 , 435 , and 436
. for iga2 , a2m1 , a2m2 , and a2m3 differ at aa residues at 115 and 124 .
the unique surrogate peptide(s ) for each isotype / subclass should be present in all of its allotypes .
since many isotypes share the same light chains (  and  ) , light chains were excluded from the peptide selection .
additional criteria that are commonly used in selecting a surrogate peptide include the following : ( a ) avoid peptides containing methionine which are prone to oxidation ; ( b ) avoid peptides containing asparagine - glycine or aspartic acid - glycine , which are prone to deamidation ; ( c ) avoid peptides containing n - terminal glutamine or glutamic acid , which are prone to n - terminal cyclization ; ( d ) avoid peptide sequences containing arginine - arginine ( rr ) and lysine - lysine ( kk ) , which yield inconsistent tryptic digestion ; ( e ) keep away from peptide sequences containing arginine - proline ( rp ) and lysine - proline ( kp ) which are difficult to break down by digestion ; ( f ) keep peptide length between 5 and 15 amino acids to minimize the number of ionization charge states , achieve efficient ms / ms fragmentation and high sensitivity , and obtain desirable chromatographic retention ; and ( g ) avoid peptide sequences containing glycosylation sites . to identify candidates for unique peptides , 15 
g / ml of individual ig pbs buffer solution was digested and the resulting digest was assayed by lc / ms using ida . the ida setup consisted of mrm survey scan for the formation of tryptic peptides based on in silico prediction , followed by enhanced product ion scans to confirm peptide identity . only peptides that met all the criteria set forth as discussed above were included in the survey scan .
peptide separation was achieved with a 20  min ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography ( uplc ) gradient program .
the top 13 most sensitive peptides for each ada isotype / subclass from the neat solution digestion were selected as unique peptide candidates and carried on for further method development . of these peptides , either doubly or triply charged parent ions were the most abundant . upon collision activation in ms / ms ,
the multiple charged parent ions fragmented into single charged b - ions and y - ions and the most sensitive y - ions were selected .
after suitable surrogate peptide candidates were identified , immunocapture was performed , and sensitivity and matrix interference were assessed for each mrm pair .
one was to capture adas with biotinylated protein z , while the other was to capture drug - ada complexes with a biotinylated mouse mab .
the workflow of the immunocapture - lc / ms assay is depictured in figure 1 . using drug as capture reagent is straightforward , similar to traditional drug - bridging ecl assays . after spiking to human plasma samples , biotinylated protein
z bound to ada to form ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes . upon adding streptavidin magnetic beads , the ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes were immobilized on the beads and then separated from matrix using a magnet .
after washing , adas were eluted from the beads and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by lc / ms analysis .
the basis of this approach was that biotinylated protein z was able to capture adas of different isotypes / subclasses present in the samples and the adas can be detected by lc / ms as long as the ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes survived the washing steps .
because there were no human ada standards available , commercial human igs were used as surrogates .
although different in their variable regions , the surrogate human igs have the same constant regions as human adas and thus produce the unique peptides of human ada isotype / subclass upon trypsin digestion which can then be detected and quantitated by lc / ms .
unlike human ada , however , the surrogate igs would not bind to biotinylated protein z to form ( biotinylated)drug - ig complexes .
therefore , instead of directly spiked into blank human plasma , the surrogate igs were spiked into the magnetic beads eluent of blank human plasma after the immunocapture steps .
the spiked and unspiked magnetic bead eluent were then digested and assayed by lc / ms .
only the mrm pairs that had the best sensitivity with minimal matrix interferences were chosen for immunocapture - lc / ms assay .  
the mrm pairs were all y - ions with m / z greater than respective parent m / z .
this was not surprising as the y - ions contained a basic amino acid ( either arginine or lysine ) at the n - terminal and thus showed better response in positive ms than b - ions .
in addition , interference was reduced significantly when m / z values of fragment ions were greater than the doubly or triply charged parent peptide m / z values .
the confirmation mrms were less sensitive and results from the confirmation peptides are expected to be similar to those from quantitation peptides . in case there is a large discrepancy between the quantitation and confirmation peptide results , investigation on the assay may be needed .
the quantitation peptides for igg1 , igg2 , igg3 , and igg4 were gpsvfplapssk , glpapiek , wyvdgvevhnak , and glpssiek , respectively .
in addition , peptides alpapiek and vvsvltvlhqdwlngk were also sensitive and found in igg1/igg3 and igg1/igg3/igg4 , respectively .
these 2 peptides were not unique to any one single ig isotype / subclass and were included as confirmation peptides .
likewise , quantitation peptides aeweqk and gqplspek and confirmation peptides levtr and vsvfvppr were identified for ige and igm , respectively . both iga1 and
iga2 shared the same peptide , yltwasr , which was much more sensitive than any other unique peptides and thus used for quantitating the total of iga1 and iga2 .
in addition , peptide tftc[cam]taaypesk was unique to iga1 . however , tftc[cam]taaypesk was much less sensitive ( 2500  ng / ml limit of detection human plasma after immunocapture ) and thus not very useful for low level ada detection .
after the final mrms were selected , lc was optimized and total runtime was shortened from 20  min to 8  min .
all the selected peptide came between 0.8 and 4  min in the 8  min run .
representative lc / ms chromatograms of igg1 , ige , and igm from the pooled ada - free blank human plasma and low limit of quantitation standards ( see discussions later ) are shown in figure 2 .
the lc / ms assay was tested with blank human plasma with and without preexisting ada ( pea ) for protein z. the blank plasma was obtained from 20 in - house healthy donors and had been screened for pea with a drug - bridging ecl assay . based on the ecl assay , plasma from 9 donors was pea negative whereas it was pea positive from the remaining 11 donors .
the 20 plasma samples were processed using the immunocapture procedures with biotinylated protein z as the capture reagent . along with the 20 plasma samples , a set of calibration standards
after digestion , the plasma samples and the calibration standards were assayed using the lc / ms ada method .
the lc / ms responses ( analyte / is peak area ratio ) of each ada isotype / subclass from the 9 pea negative and the 11 pea positive human plasma samples are listed in tables 2 and 3 , respectively .
similar to traditional drug - bridging assays , the cut - point was set at 95% to allow a rate of 5% false positives and determined with the 9 lots of pea negative human blank plasma .
the lc / ms peak area ratios of ada igg1 isotope ranged from 0.0060 to 0.0637 , with a mean of 0.0216 and a standard deviation ( sd ) of 0.0177 ( table 2 ) . using the standard calculation formulation for 95% cut - point , mean + 1.645  sd ,
the calculated cut - point value was 0.0507 for igg1 . compared to the cut - point , 8 of 11 pea positive samples were also ada ( igg1 ) positive by the immunocapture - lc / ms assay ( table 3 ) .
the ada ( igg1 ) response in the remaining 3 samples ( lots 5 , 7 , and 8) ranged from 0.0150 to 0.0239 , which was below the cut - point .
likewise , cut - points were calculated for all other ada isotypes / subclasses ( table 2 ) .
based on the cut - points , there were one ada positive plasma lot each for igg2 and igm and 2 for igg3 while none for igg4 and ige by the immunocapture - lc / ms assay .
in contrast , all these 11 samples were ada positive for iga1 and/or iga2 . as discussed below , except for igg1 , the lc / ms responses of all other isotypes / subclasses
were below limit of quantitation ( blq ) and , therefore , their contributions to the overall ada amounts were negligible .
ada levels in the 11 pea positive samples were semiquantitatively determined using a calibration curve .
a series of matrix calibration standards ranged from 0.05 to 10  g / ml were prepared in the magnetic bead eluent of pooled blank human plasma by spiking neat ig isotype standard solutions .
the matrix calibration standards were then digested and assayed by lc / ms . the calibration curve for each ig isotype
/ subclass was constructed using lc / ms peak area ratios of peptide versus respective stable isotope labeled is .
the ada concentration in the plasma samples was back - calculated using the calibration curve . during the immunocapture process
, the ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes were separated from the plasma by a magnet . however , as endogenous plasma igs were at much higher levels , a small amount still remained on the beads even after the washing .
the endogenous igs surviving the washing step were carried on in subsequent elution and digestion and eventually detected as background peaks in the lc / ms assay .
the endogenous interference peaks of igg1 and igm and ige were clearly seen in the chromatograms of the blank plasma sample ( figure 2 ) .
the endogenous interference peak intensity seemed to follow the order of ig abundance in human plasma .
similar to traditional lc / ms assay , the low limit of quantitation ( lloq ) of the calibration curve was defined such that lc / ms response at lloq was equal to or greater than 4x matrix background response . as shown in figure 2 ,
the lloq peaks were much higher than the corresponding matrix interference peaks and the peak areas were accurately measured .
the lloq determined for each isotype / subclass ranged from 0.1 to 0.5  g / ml .
/ subclasses , igg4 , ige , and [ iga1 + iga2 ] had the highest assay sensitivity with lloq of 0.1  g / ml . the higher limit of quantitation ( hloq ) of the calibration curve range depended on the beads and capture reagent capacity . however , as the calibration standards were prepared after immunocapture , the beads and capture reagent capacity could not be readily assessed .
based on our experiences with immunocapture using similar experimental settings , the hloq was arbitrarily set at 10  g / ml for all isotypes / subclasses , which should be well within the capacity of the assay .
the curve linear regression correlation coefficients ( r ) were all > 0.9910 except for peptide wyvdgvevhnak ( igg3 , which was 0.9858 ) .
the calibration linear ranges and correlation coefficients ( r ) are listed in table 4 .
representative calibration curve of igg1 in human plasma eluent after immunocapture is shown in figure 3 . using the calibration curve ,
only 2 out of the 11 pea positive samples had ada levels ( for igg1 only ) above the lloq 0.5  g / ml . lots 3 and 11 had ada igg1 level of 0.660 and 0.680  g / ml , respectively .
it is expected that ada igg1 levels in some of the 9 samples could be quantitated if the lc / ms assay sensitivity was further improved .
obviously , in order to increase the assay lc / ms specificity , one has to further eliminate endogenous igs to minimize the background response .
this was consistent with the fact that igg1 is the most dominant antibody in human plasma .
the biggest caveat of the semiquantitation approach was that the calibration standards did not go through the immunocapture process whereas the study samples did .
the recovery could be estimated using well characterized polyclonal human ada positive controls , which were not available for protein z. based on our experiences with immunocapture in similar experimental setting and those reported in literature , immunocapture recovery varied from project to project but usually falls within a 3050% range .
if this also held true for protein z , the measured ada levels in the pea plasma would be around 3050% of actual concentrations .
different from ecl assays , the ada levels measured by the immunocapture - lc / ms represent absolute amounts .
this allows one to compare ada isotype levels between samples , studies , and different biotherapeutics .
database of such information could be gradually built and provide valuable insight to better understand immunogenicity and immunology of biotherapeutics . as with traditional ecl drug - bridging assays , the immunocapture - lc / ms method could be hampered by drug tolerance issues when drug is present .
this limitation may be overcome by using acid dissociation to break up the drug - ada complex and release ada .
biotinylated drug is then added to the samples so that the biotinylated drug competes with the existing drug in forming ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes .
if the amount of the biotinylated drug is much more than that of existing drug which is usually determined with a pk assay , the drug interference is greatly reduced and assay sensitivity is improved . in ecl drug - bridging assays , one binding domain of
ada has to bind to biotinylated drug while the other binds to sulfotagged drug in order to form ( biotinylated)drug - ada-(sulfotagged)drug complex and be detected . in the immunocapture - lc / ms assay , on the other hand , only one arm of ada needs to bind to biotinylated drug and the other can still bind to the unlabeled drug .
therefore , drug interference is expected to be less in immunocapture - lc / ms assay platform .
it should be noted that if drug contains the human ig fc region , it may also bind to the beads via nonspecific binding just like endogenous proteins and could contribute to interference in the lc / ms assay . on the other hand ,
biotinylated drug that binds to streptavidin beads will not be eluted out under the elution conditions due to very strong biotin - streptavidin interaction .
the binding between streptavidin and biotin has long been regarded as the strongest , noncovalent , biological interaction known , with a dissociation constant kd in the order of 4  10  m .
the bond forms very rapidly and is stable in wide ranges of ph and temperature [ 53 , 54 ] .
it was evident that the results from the immunocapture - lc / ms assay confirmed pea positive results in most of these samples and were in good agreement with the drug - bridging ecl assay .
the second immunocapture approach was using a mouse anti - protein z mab to capture ada in human plasma . in this approach ,
all adas had to be first completely converted to drug - ada complexes by adding excessive protein z to the samples .
biotinylated mouse mab was then added to capture the protein z - ada complexes along with free protein z. in the presence of mab , the drug - ada complexes and free drug were converted to drug - ada - mab complexes and drug - mab complexes , respectively . after adding streptavidin magnetic beads , the complexes were immobilized on the beads and were subsequently separated from plasma using a magnet .
ada was then eluted from the beads , digested , and assayed by lc / ms following the same procedures with drug as the capture reagent described previously .
the merit using anti - drug ab as the capture reagent lies on that drug no longer interferes with the assay .
this offers a huge advantage when drug levels in the study samples are high enough such that drug tolerance becomes a concern in other types of assays .
the most important element of this approach is that the capture ab should not compete with ada for the drug ; that is , the two should not share the same binding domain on the drug . to confirm this for the mouse mab ,
protein z was spiked at 5  ng / ml to the pooled pea negative and the 11 positive human plasma samples and its concentration was determined using an immunocapture - lc / ms pk assay .
the pk assay was developed in our lab to support clinical studies . in the pk assay ,
protein z was captured using the mouse mab , and the resulting drug - mab complex was then immobilized on magnetic beads , separated from plasma , eluted out from beads , digested , and analyzed by lc / ms .
a unique peptide from protein z was monitored by lc / ms and used to quantitate protein z. the immunocapture recovery was determined by comparing protein z concentrations in the pea positive human plasma with the pooled pea negative plasma .
no difference in protein z concentration was observed between the pea positive and pea negative samples ( data not shown ) , and protein z recovery was more than 82% with averaging 97% .
it was evident that the mouse mab was indeed able to capture protein z regardless of whether it is in ada - protein z complexes or free form .
however , one has to be cautious as human adas come in many different forms and some may bind to the same domain on the drug as the capture ab .
therefore , it is recommended to run this test using ada positive samples from the study .
similar to the first approach using drug as capture reagent , the 11 pea positive and 9 pea negative blank human plasma samples were used to evaluate immunocapture using the mouse mab as the capture reagent .
besides using a different capture reagent , the only difference between the two approaches was that in the second approach there was an additional step to convert ada to ada - drug complexes . to ensure a complete conversion , 6  l of 5  mg / ml
the amount of protein z added was overwhelmingly more than the pea level ( 680  ng / ml ) estimated by the first approach .
the same amount of protein z was also added to the pooled pea blank plasma used for preparation of calibration standards .
tables 5 and 6 provide the lc / ms peak area ratio response of ada in the pea negative and positive samples , respectively .
the lc / ms chromatograms of igg1 , igm , and ige unique peptides from the blank human plasma and lloq samples are shown in figure 4 . the lc / ms response for ada ( igg1 ) from the 9 pea negative samples ranged from 0.0210 to 0.0815 , with a mean of 0.0361 and sd of 0.0194 .
the calculated cut - point at 95% was 0.0680 for igg1 . using the cut - point , 7 of the 11 pea positive samples were also ada positive with the immunocapture - lc / ms assay .
these 7 plasma lots were also ada positive in the first approach using drug as capture reagent .
plasma lot 2 was ada positive in the first approach but negative in the second approach . in both approaches , lc / ms response of plasma lot 2 was close to the respective cut - point , so it was not surprising to see the discrepancy between the two approaches . calculated cut - points for all other ada isotypes / subclasses are listed in table 5 . based on cut - points , lot 7 was ada positive for igg2 , lot 8 was ada positive for igg3 , lot 11 was ada positive for igm , and lots 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , and 11 were ada positive for iga1 + iga2 .
however , lot 7 for igg2 , lot 11 for igm , and lots 6 and 11 for iga1 + a2 were considered false positive due to the presence of interference as discussed below .
the ada must be bound to the drug first , and the resulting drug - ada complexes had to be bound to the mouse mab and survive the immunocapture procedure in order to be detected by lc / ms .
endogenous components such as igs that cross - reacted with the mab could also interfere with the assay and give false positive results .
although this potential interference was already accounted for in the cut - point determination , it was further assessed for the pea positive plasma samples without the addition of excessive protein z. the  drug 
plasma samples were spiked with the mab and then processed with the immunocapture procedure followed by lc / ms analysis .
the lc / ms responses from the  drug  samples of lots 6 ( 0.0731 ) and 11 ( 0.0974 ) were above the cut - point of 0.0680 , suggesting possible interference
. however , both responses were slightly above the cut - points and much less than those ( 0.1800 and 0.5690 ) from their respective  + drug  samples .
therefore , lots 6 and 11 were still considered ada positive despite the presence of small interference .
likewise , lot 4 was considered positive for iga1 + a2 , as the above cut - point 
drug  response ( 0.1380 ) was much less than  + drug  responses ( 0.2300 ) . the remaining 
drug  positive samples , lot 7 for igg2 , lot 11 for igm , and lots 6 and 11 for iga1 + a2 gave similar responses as their respective 
overall , seven of the eleven pea positive plasma samples were positive for igg1 , one was positive for igg3 , and three were positive for iga1 + iga2 using the mab as ada capture reagent .
calibration curves were established for each ada isotype in the same way as in the first approach .
hloq was also set at 10  g / ml for all isotypes / subclasses .
the lloq , calibration ranges , and r were all similar to those from the first approach using drug as capture reagent . using the calibration curve , ada ( igg1 ) level in lot 3 and lot 11 plasma was determined to be 0.570 and 1.25  g / ml , respectively .
these two plasma samples were also the only ones with ada ( igg1 ) level above lloq in the first immunocapture approach .
the ada ( igg1 ) level from the first approach was 13.6% and 45.6% , respectively , compared with the second approach .
given the two totally different immunocapture approaches and the limited sample size , the two sets of semiquantitative data were considered in good agreement with each other . besides igg1 , ada levels for other ada isotypes / classes were all blq in these 11 pea positive samples .
it should be noted that the anti - drug ab capture approach may not be used if the biotherapeutic proteins contain constant human fc regions .
unlike using drug as capture reagent , anti - drug ab captures both free drug and drug - ada complexes and during the ada elution step drug is also eluted out from magnetic beads and thus interferes with lc / ms detection .
for instance , humira ( adalimumab ) , a tnf inhibiting anti - inflammatory drug and the first fully human monoclonal antibody drug approved by the fda , is an igg1 made by phage display technology with amino acid sequences only from the human germline , making it indistinguishable in structure and function from natural human igg1 . based on in silicon digestion prediction
, humira would yield the universal peptides of human igg1 , gpsvfplapssk , and thus interfere with the universal peptide ada assay . in this case ,
unique peptide(s ) from the drug instead of the ada peptides might be monitored by lc / ms and the results can be qualitatively correlated to ada , as neubert et al .   reported .
another option is to use the first immunocapture approach with biotinylated drug as the ada capture reagent .
we demonstrated for the first time that immunocapture - lc / ms can be used for simultaneous ada isotyping and semiquantitation in human plasma .
either biotinylated drug or biotinylated anti - drug ab could be used as the immunocapture reagent , each with its own merits and shortfalls .
biotinylated drug can readily capture ada but drug interference could be an issue if drug levels in the samples are high .
on the other hand , immunocapture using an anti - drug ab eliminates drug interference , providing that the ab is able to capture drug - ada complex in addition to free drug . with this method ,
unique peptides from each ada isotype / subclass were identified and monitored by lc / ms .
similar to traditional drug - bridging elisa assay , cut - points at 95% were established .
the assay was used for screening , isotyping , and semiquantitating preexisting adas in human plasma .
endogenous ig interferences need to be reduced in order to improve the assay sensitivity and specificity , and human positive ada controls will be needed for more accurate ada quantitation .
owing to lc / ms 's advantages such as high specificity , selectivity and reproducibility , wide dynamic range , and multiplexing capability , it is expected that , with further improvements , immunocapture - lc / ms will become an invaluable tool in immunogenicity assessment . it can be easily implemented in bioanalytical lab settings for routine ada isotyping and semiquantitation .
as ada levels measured by immunocapture - lc / ms represent absolute amounts , one can compare ada isotype levels between samples , studies , and different biotherapeutics , providing that consistency in positive controls is achieved to determine recovery .
database of such information could be gradually built and provide valuable insight to better understand immunogenicity and immunology of biotherapeutics .","1. Introduction

"in tissue engineering research , it is necessary to develop effective culture substrates for cells to facilitate regeneration of deficient tissue .
it has been shown that the environment surrounding cells has a significant effect on cell behavior .
the physical conditions of any scaffold to which cells adhere are an important determinant of cell growth [ 16 ] , along with biochemical signals .
cells receive various types of information from the culture substrate , such as surface stiffness [ 14 ] or roughness [ 5 , 6 ] .
therefore , a good understanding of the relationship between cellular behavior and the physical characteristics of culture substrates is critical for development of effective scaffolds that allow suitable cell adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation . in a previous study
, we demonstrated that ferric - ion - cross - linked alginate ( fe - alginate ) was an efficient material for use as scaffold , allowing good cell adhesion and proliferation .
alginates are a material widely used in various biomedical fields , and are composed of 1,4-linked -d - mannuronic acid ( m ) and -l - guluronic acid ( g ) residues , forming gels with certain multivalent metal ions [ 8 , 9 ] .
calcium ions are used most frequently as a cross - linking agent for alginates , but calcium - ion - cross - linked alginate ( ca - alginate ) is known to be an unfavorable culture substrate for cells .
fe - alginate is able to overcome the deficiencies of ca - alginate , such as poor protein adsorptive capacity , and has been established as an effective cell culture substrate .
alginates are commonly derived from seaweed , and have widely varying proportions and sequences of two the m and g monomers depending on the source from which they are derived [ 8 , 10 ] .
it is known that the m / g ratio influences the mechanical properties of ca - alginate gels : those with a high g - content have higher mechanical strength than those with a high m - content .
it has also been reported that high - g ca - alginate forms more porous gels , and that the cross - linkages tend to be more stable over a longer period , than is the case for high - m alginate . in the case of fe - alginate
, it is considered that the alginate composition can also influence the condition of the gel .
however , the effects of fe - alginate substrate composition on gel properties and the growth of cultured cells have not been clarified .
the aim of this study was to define the relationship between fe - alginate composition and the growth of cells cultured on fe - alginate films .
we evaluated the efficiency of cell adhesion and proliferation on fe - alginate films with differing m / g ratios , using normal human dermal fibroblasts ( nhdf ) as model cells .
we also focused on the degree of change in the condition of the fe - alginate gel during cell culture . here
we report that favorable cell proliferation was observed on high - g , rather than on high - m fe - alginate gels , and that the stability of fe - alginate gel with firm cross - linkage between alginate and ferric ions seems to be a key supportive element for good cell proliferation .
eagle 's minimum essential medium ( e - mem ) was obtained from nissui pharmaceutical ( tokyo , japan ) , fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) was from tissue culture biologicals ( tulare , ca , usa ) , and trypsin was from becton dickinson ( sparks , md , usa ) .
anti - vitronectin polyclonal antibody was purchased from abd serotec ( oxford , uk ) .
horseradish peroxidase ( hrp)-conjugated anti - rabbit igg was from santa cruz biotechnology ( santa cruz , ca , usa ) .
all other chemicals were purchased from wako pure chemical co. ( tokyo , japan ) .
two types of alginate were used in this study : a high g - content alginate ( m  :  g ratio 34  :  66 ) and a high m - content alginate ( m  :  g ratio 57  :  43 ) . the viscosity ( 1% ( w / v ) solution at 20c ) of both alginates , purchased from kimica corporation ( tokyo , japan ) , was about 100200  mpas .
the procedures for preparation of the fe - alginate gel films have been described previously .
briefly , 3  ml of 1% ( w / v ) alginate solution was added to the wells of 6-well tissue culture plates along with cellulosic sheets ( bemcot , ozu corporation , tokyo , japan ) as frames , and then dried at 60c overnight . after drying ,
3  ml of 500  mm or 50  mm fecl3 was added to each well to induce cross - linkage of the alginate at 25c for 30  min .
the resulting gel films were washed with deionized water to remove unreacted ions on the surface , and sterilized with 70% ( v / v ) ethanol . before seeding of cells on the films , the films were stabilized by immersion in e - mem at 37c under a 5% co2 atmosphere for 72  h , and the medium was replaced every 24  h. nhdf were cultured in e - mem with 10% ( v / v ) fbs at 37c under a 5% co2 atmosphere . to detach cells by trypsinization
, the cells were incubated with 0.25% ( w / v ) trypsin and 0.02% ( w / v ) edta in ca- , mg - free phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) at 37c for 10  min .
e - mem containing 10% ( v / v ) fbs was subsequently added to terminate the enzyme reaction .
the cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000  g for 5  min and resuspended in e - mem containing 10% ( v / v ) fbs .
the cells were counted with a coulter counter ( beckman coulter corporation , fl , usa ) and seeded onto fe - alginate films in 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 4000  cells / cm in 3  ml of culture medium .
samples were incubated at 37c under a 5% co2 atmosphere and the medium was replaced every day .
after 1 , 5 , and 8 days , the cells were observed using a phase - contrast microscope and photographed , and then cell counting was performed to quantify the degree of cell proliferation . to count the attached cells ,
the cells were detached by trypsinization at 37c for 10  min , and then resuspended in e - mem containing 10% ( v / v ) fbs .
cells were also cultured on high m - content fe - alginate films after immersion in e - mem at 37c under a 5% co2 atmosphere for 8 days to stabilize the gel condition .
alginate films were immersed in fbs ( 0.2  ml / cm ) in a 6-well tissue culture plate at 37c for 2  h. after incubation , the films were washed with deionized water , and transferred to new tissue culture plates .
then 1% triton x-100 ( 0.1  ml / cm ) was added to desorb the proteins on the film surfaces at 37c for 2  h. protein concentrations of the desorption fraction were determined using a bicinchoninic acid ( bca ) protein assay reagent kit ( thermo fisher scientific pierce biotechnology , il , usa ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .
the solutions were also collected to separate the proteins in the solutions using sds - page on 10% polyacrylamide gel .
protein bands in the gel were transferred to immobilon membranes ( millipore , bedford , ma , usa ) for immunoblot analysis .
the blotted membranes were treated with 5% ( w / v ) non - fat dried milk in pbs for blocking , and then incubated with anti - vitronectin antibody diluted with the blocking solution at room temperature for 60  min .
after washing with 0.05% ( v / v ) tween 20 in pbs , the membranes were incubated with hrp - conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 60  min , and the immunospecific bands on the membranes were visualized by the dab color reaction method .
quantitative analysis of adsorbed vitronectin was performed using image j 1.40  g ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij ) .
alteration of alginate gel conditions during the culture period was evaluated by measuring the degree of swelling and polymer content of the gels .
the assessments were conducted at 1 , 5 , 8 , and 16 days after the start of incubation . to investigate the degree of gel swelling ,
the thickness of the alginate films was determined using a dial thickness gauge ( g-7c ; ozaki mfg .
co. , ltd . ) . for estimation of polymer content , dry weight was measured after cultivation by weighing the gel that had been dried at 60c for 2  h. statistical analysis was performed using kaleidagraph version 4.0 software .
the adequacy of high g- and m - content fe - alginate films as culture substrates was investigated by cultivation of nhdf on the respective gels . in the initial stage of culture ,
the number of attached cells and cell morphology showed little difference between the two fe - alginates ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
however , as culture time progressed , the number of attached cells on the high - g fe - alginate gel was notably higher than that on the high - m gels ( figure 1 ) .
cells on the high - g fe - alginate film showed good spread morphology throughout the culture period ( figures 2(a)2(c ) ) .
conversely , on the high - g fe - alginate film , many cells became detached from the substrate , while maintaining cell - cell association , after 8 days of culture ( figure 2(f ) ) .
the protein adsorption ability of high - g and high - m alginate was investigated .
quantitative analysis demonstrated that both types of gel had an equivalent ability to adsorb serum proteins ( figure 3(a ) ) .
moreover , immunoblot analysis revealed the same degree of adsorption of vitronectin , the major cellular adhesion - related serum protein , on both alginate gels ( figure 3(b ) ) .
changes in the conditions of fe - alginate gel in the culture medium were evaluated by measurement of gel thickness and dry weight ( figure 4 ) .
gel thickness gave an indication of the degree of swelling , whereas dry weight reflected the degree of gel disintegration .
the conditions of the high - g fe - alginate gel showed no significant change even after 16 days .
in contrast , the high - m fe - alginate gel became thicker , and the dry weight decreased with time .
the rate of change in the properties of the high - m fe - alginate gel was rapid until around 8 days , but became more stable thereafter .
fe - alginate gel was stabilized by immersion in culture medium for 8 days to prevent any further changes in gel condition .
good cell proliferation was confirmed on stable high - m fe - alginate films at the same level as that on high - g fe - alginate films ( figure 5 ) . to investigate whether the amount of cross - linked ferric ions has a decisive influence on the properties of the two types of alginate , we studied cell growth on fe - alginate films with a low concentration of cross - linked ions .
the concentration of ferric ions for cross - linkage of alginate employed under ordinary circumstances ( 500  mm fecl3 ) was determined previously to obtain sufficient film strength and to avoid excessive inhibition of cell growth , and the minimum required concentration of fecl3 solution to maintain the film strength needed for cell culture using our methodology was 50  mm . in both types of alginate , cell growth on gels with
a low concentration of cross - linked ferric ions was comparable to that on gels with a normal iron concentration ( figure 6(a ) ) .
the same tendency was revealed with regard to gel condition ( figures 6(b ) and 6(c ) ) , although the thickness of both types of alginate gel increased as the concentration of cross - linked ferric ions decreased ( figure 6(b ) ) .
to establish fe - alginate as an effective material for biomedical applications in research and therapeutics , an understanding of how the composition of fe - alginate influences its suitability as a culture substrate for encouraging good cell growth is of considerable significance . in this study , we observed that strong cross - linkage with ferric ions was necessary to ensure good cell proliferation during culture , and that alginate with a high g rather than a high m content showed better conservation of ferric ion cross - linkages . in the case of ca - alginate gels , it is reported that the m / g ratio influences cell compatibility .
for instance , murine insulinoma cells encapsulated in high - m rather than high - g ca - alginate showed rapid growth and good metabolic activities .
conversely , in the case of encapsulated neural stem cells , high - g ca - alginate microcapsules allowed better release of neurotrophic factor .
studies of ca - alginate as a scaffold for cells have revealed that a high g content promptes good cell growth [ 14 , 15 ] .
our present results demonstrated superior nhdf cell growth on high - g rather than high - m fe - alginate films ( figure 1 ) .
additionally , we demonstrated that good cell growth occurred on high - m fe - alginate films under conditions that tended not to result in gel swelling and disintegration ( figure 5 ) .
it is known that cells recognize proteins that are adsorbed onto the surfaces of substrate materials [ 1618 ] . in particular
, vitronectin is a major factor that mediates initial adhesion of nhdf onto fe - alginate films in the presence of serum . in the present study ,
there was little difference in the ability to adsorb serum proteins , including vitronectin , between the two types of fe - alginate gel ( figure 3 ) .
high - m and high - g alginate gels showed comparable efficacy to promote initial cell adhesion ( figures 1 and 2 ) , being consistent with their similar protein adsorption capacities .
the interaction between cells and high - m fe - alginate appeared to be weakened in response to alterations in the condition of the gel .
a reduced degree of cell - substratum interaction probably caused cell detachment , although cell - cell interaction was maintained .
swelling and dissolution of high - m fe - alginate observed in this study may have been caused by loss of cross - linked ferric ions from the gels . under physiological conditions ,
disengagement of cross - linking ions from alginate gels occurs in the presence of chelators , monovalent ions , and non - cross - linking divalent ions [ 19 , 20 ] .
it is also reported that high - m ca - alginate shows loss of mechanical strength during culture .
calcium ions are known to bind to g- and mg - blocks of alginate . however , since interactions between calcium ions and the hydroxyl groups of mg are prevented by the intrinsic configurational characteristics of the mg building blocks , mg sequences in ca - alginate have a more flexible structure than g sequences . therefore the structures formed by mg junctions are likely to disassociate in response to the presence of competing ions or application of stress .
although the blocks of alginate involved in binding to ferric ions are unknown , the present study suggested that the binding of ferric ions to alginate might occur through a mechanism similar to that for calcium ions .
it can be inferred that ferric ions combine with not only g - blocks but also mg- and/or m - blocks in alginate , because gel swelling and breakage were observed in high - m rather than high - g alginate under physiological conditions ( figure 4 ) . further clarification of the interaction between ferric ions and alginate may lead to better understanding of the properties of fe - alginate affecting cell culture . it has been reported that high - m ca - alginate shows no further changes in material properties after 7 days of exposure to nacl . in the present study ,
high - m fe - alginate gels immersed in culture solution for 8 days also showed little change in gel conditions , such as swelling or polymer content ( figure 4 ) . on high - m alginate gels under the same conditions ,
nhdf were able to proliferate at the same level as that on high - g alginate gels ( figure 5 ) .
there is some question as to whether cell growth on high - m alginate films is inhibited by elution of substances from the gels .
however , no harmful effects on cell growth were evident when cells were cultured on the surface of tissue culture plates in medium together with high - m alginate gel film ( data not shown ) , thus suggesting that the eluted materials did not influence cell growth appreciably .
reduction of the concentration of ferric ions cross - linked with alginate did not affect the growth of nhdf seeded on both types of alginate gel ( figure 6 ) .
in fact , cells proliferated well on highly swollen high - g alginate with a decreased amount of cross - linked ferric ions .
thus , swelling of fe - alginate gels was not directly linked to scanty growth of cells cultured on gel surfaces . in the case of high - m alginate ,
gel conditions were changed during immersion in culture medium , even though the concentration of cross - linked ferric ions was low .
it is considered that the percentage of firm cross - linkage in high - m alginate gels is unrelated to the amount of cross - linked ferric ions . in the case of high - m alginate gels under physiological conditions ,
strong cross - linkage may be maintained , while weak cross - linkage may occur as a result of exchange of cross - linked ferric ions for other competing ions .
in this study , we have revealed for the first time the effects of fe - alginate composition on the properties of the gels and their suitability as a culture substrate for cells .
fe - alginate gel with a high g content showed stable cross - linkage with ferric ions , and supported good cell proliferation . in the case of high - m alginate , although partial weak cross - linkage was observed during culture and the cell growth rate was suboptimal , the effectiveness of the gel for supporting cell growth was recognized after it had been stabilized by immersion in culture medium for an appropriate period .
in fact , the protein adsorption abilities of the two types of fe - alginate gels ware similar .
therefore , it is considered that the major factor influencing cell growth on two types of fe - alginate films is the stability of the gel during culture , and that the mode of cross - linkage between ferric ions and alginate differs according to alginate composition .
these results suggest that the composition of fe - alginate gels could be altered according to their intended purpose .
it is anticipated that our findings will be useful for extending the application of fe - alginate to diverse biomedical fields .","1. Introduction

"a 17-year - old boy sustained blunt trauma from a tennis ball to his left eye , 5 h before examination . only hand movements were perceivable and projection of light rays was accurate .
clinically , a full - thickness mh , sized 415 m , with coexistent macular detachment of height 458 m on optical coherence tomography ( oct ) examination ( stratus oct , carl zeiss meditec inc . ,
usa ) , was detected along with commotio retinae and widespread subretinal hemorrhages of the posterior pole and inferior retina [ fig .
examination by microperimetry ( mp-1 , nidek technologies srl , italy ) demonstrated reduced sensitivity of the macula to high - intensity light stimuli [ fig .
surgical intervention was contemplated . however , follow - up examination 3 days later surprisingly revealed that the mh had reduced in size to 218 m .
careful serial follow - up found complete closure of the mh and near complete resolution of the macular detachment 7 days after presentation [ fig . 2a and b ] .
three weeks posttrauma , the chorioretinal scarring and pigmentary changes at the macula were very prominent [ fig .
2d ] . significant atrophy and thinning of all the retinal layers was evident on oct examination ; the foveal thickness was 82 m [ fig .
large atrophic holes were noticed at this time in the inferior retina and were delimited by laser photocoagulation [ fig .
microperimetry , done with four - cross target because of poor fixation , reveals loss of perceived stimuli at the macula ( c ) .
the macular hole is smaller and the detachment shallower after 3 days ( d and e ) .
microperimetry shows absolute scotoma ( f ) seven days later , the macular hole is closed and the subretinal fluid nearly completely absorbed ( a and b ) .
three weeks later , the chorioretinal scarring is very prominent ( d and e ) .
two considerations relevant to the management of the present subject are , first , the mechanisms involved in the formation and closure of the traumatic mh and detachment , and second , whether a waiting period is advisable before undertaking any surgical repair . with respect to the first issue , the most important fact to understand is that the vitreous is very tightly adherent to the macula in young normal eyes , putting considerable stress upon this region when compression  expansion of the globe occurs in a concussion injury .
most eyes with a traumatic mh have an attached vitreous.[68 ] oct imaging corroborates this finding lending credence to the belief that the pathogenesis of mh is independent of the occurrence of a posterior vitreous detachment ( pvd ) and occurs likely as an immediate mechanical disruption in a coup contrecoup injury .
delayed mh may however develop if pvd is incomplete , causing continued foveal traction , or due to contusion necrosis , or consequent to the formation and rupture of a foveal cyst.[57 ] a pvd was absent in our case and we believe that the hole occurred due to mechanical disruption as an immediate effect of concussion [ supplementary figs . 1 and 2 ] . a rd may occur due to the mechanical distortion that occurs between the retina and the vitreous ; loss of the retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) function and the hyperpermeability of retinal vessels consequent to the retinochoroidal concussion injury may be the important contributing factors .
vertical scan through the macula on optical coherence tomography at presentation showing discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium and a full - thickness macular hole - associated retinal detachment horizontal scan through the macula on optical coherence tomography at presentation showing discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium and a full - thickness macular hole - associated retinal detachment the mechanisms responsible for the spontaneous closure of a traumatic mh include proliferating glial cells and rpe cells from the edges that fill the hole ; formation of an epiretinal membrane that constricts the hole ; and reattachment of the operculum to the mh .
there was no operculum or membrane formation in our case but we expect the proliferating potential of the recovering glial and rpe cells to be high in our patient , considering his young age , which eventually led to the closure of the mh .
this mechanism is consistent with the histopathologic study of a surgically treated mh which was closed by bridging glial tissue .
a quick recovery of the rpe function in young eyes also ensures the rapid absorption of the subretinal fluid .
the resolution of the rd , simultaneous to the closure of the mh seems necessary for the successful resolution of both pathologies .
we observed these processes occurring concurrently in our patient , leaving anatomically resolved rd and mh within 7 days of presentation .
the time and need of surgical intervention is an open question with no available answer ; mhs and rds rarely arise simultaneously after trauma and therefore specific management guidelines are lacking .
traumatic mhs are known to close spontaneously and a period of observation till 6 months has been advised before undertaking a surgical repair .
chen et al . achieved retinal reattachment with the vitrectomy procedure and gas tamponade in seven patients out of eight who had traumatic mh - related rds .
recently , spontaneous resolution of a traumatic mh - related macular detachment , which occurred within 3 weeks , has been described in a young patient .
our patient experienced a complete closure of the mh and resolution of the macular detachment 1 week after the incident of trauma , young age and a relatively small size of the hole apparently being the factors responsible for a better anatomical outcome .
however , functional visual improvement failed to occur despite anatomical reattachment of the retina because of irreversible changes at the macula .
one must understand that functional and anatomical results may not correlate depending on the severity of the trauma ; the final va depends upon the degree of photoreceptor and rpe cell disruption .
immediate visual loss after injury due to retinal dehiscence is followed by a delayed visual loss due to secondary changes in the retinochoroidal layer [ supplementary fig .
besides this , our case illustrates that the spontaneous reattachment of a traumatic mh - related macular detachment is possible and a clear evidence of progressive clinical improvement entails a waiting period in the expectation of a spontaneous recovery .

"semiconductor quantum dots are excellent fluorescent nanoprobes for biological and biomedical applications because of their unique size - dependent optical and electronic properties ( penn et al 2003 ; alivisatos
these nanoparticles ( nps ) possess unique optical properties in comparison with traditional organic dyes including size- and composition - tunable emission , narrow emission spectra , and excellent photostability ( hotz 2005 ) .
recent improvements in surface chemistry have augmented the ability to make functionalized nps to create bioconjugated nps that allow for specific targeting or signal enhancement ( farokhzad et al 2006 ; fujiwara et al 2006 ; goodman et al 2006 ; ipe et al 2006 ; suk et al 2006 ) .
bioconjugated nps , coupled with spectroscopy or other spectral imaging tools , eg , flow cytometry and histological techniques , provides a novel and powerful platform for mapping the molecular and disease profiles associated with infection by different pathogens ( zhao et al 2004 ; driskell et al 2005 ; yao et al 2006 ; mcveigh 2006 ) .
another advantage of bioconjugated nps over conventional pathogen detection methods is that the nps may be conjugated with many biomolecules thereby enhancing the signal and the binding avidity by mitigating a multivalency effect .
this is particularly important for targeting nps and for increasing the delivery or efficacy of bioconjugated molecules .
however , only limited reports are available which address the utility of nps for detection or diagnosis virus infection ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ; bentzen et al 2005 ; driskell et al 2005 ; li , cu , et al 2005 ; li , liu , et al 2005 ; wabuyele and vo - dinh 2005 ; wan et al 2005 ; fuentes et al 2006 ; liu , cao , et al 2006 ; souza et al 2006 ) . respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a single - stranded negative sense rna virus in the paramyxoviridae family that is the primary cause of morbidity and life - threatening lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide , as well as an important pathogen of the elderly and immune compromised ( bader and mckinsey 2005 ; ebbert and limper 2005 ; mejias et al 2005 ) the disease burden associated with rsv infection is considerable as rsv is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide having infection rates approaching 70%80% in the first year of life with many patients requiring hospitalization ( mccarthy and hall 2003 ; leung et al 2005 ) .
unfortunately , despite five decades of research , no safe and effective rsv vaccine is available and few effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments are available .
thus , there is a critical need for the development of novel tools and platforms to augment virus diagnosis and foundational studies required for development of disease intervention strategies .
the surface topography of viruses lends to detection by antibodies , a feature that has been successfully used for bio - conjuagted np detection of rsv ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ; bentzen et al 2005 ) .
rsv has two major surface proteins , ie , g and f proteins , that are primarily responsible for virus attachment and fusion , respectively ( tripp 2005 ) .
both g and f proteins are recognized by the immune system as neutralizing antigens ; thus a majority of antibodies are directed toward these proteins ( tripp 2005 ) .
the rsv f protein is more conserved than the g protein among rsv strains ( tripp 2005 ) , thus antibodies reactive to the f protein are ideal target developing bioconjugated nanoparticles . taking advantage of the composition - tunable emission of nps and their multivalent specificity
when conjugated to monoclonal antibodies , we tested the ability of these bioconjugated nps to detect rsv infection in vitro and in vivo using in a single - step format . we show that bioconjugated nps can be used to rapidly and sensitively detect rsv infection in both cell lines and mice , and that the detection can be done in a single step format .
this single - step format dramatically improves virus detection time , potentially saves costs , and reduces background staining that is currently associated with conventional virus detection methods .
to develop bioconjugated nanoparticles to detect rsv infection , semiconductor cadmium telluride ( cdte ) quantum dots ( qds ) were synthesized as previously described ( wang et al 2002 ; liu , chen , et al 2006 ) .
qds have been reported to be an excellent quantum particle for use in biological systems based on very high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies , and the ability to cover the whole visible spectral range depending on particle size ( liu , chen , et al 2006 ) .
thus , two different sized cdte qds with emission peaks at 585 nm and 540 nm were prepared ( figure 1 ) and used in the preparation of bioconjugated nanoparticles ( nps ) for detection of rsv infection .
these particles were prepared for bioconjugation as previously described ( wang et al 2002 ) , and conjugated to monoclonal antibodies reactive to rsv f protein , clone 131 - 2a .
briefly , thioglycolate ( tga)-coated cdte particles were mixed 1:1 with rsv anti - f protein monoclonal antibody ( 4 mg / ml ) and the solution was stabilized with 10x phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) , ph 7.2 to a final 1 x pbs concentration .
edc / nhs ( 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hcl / n - hydroxysulfosuccinimide ) was added to bring to qd solution to a final concentration of 50 mm/5 mm , respectively .
the reaction was incubated for 2 h at room temperature , then overnight at 4 c .
precipitated bioconjugated np aggregates were separated by centrifugation to remove unwanted aggregates from single , bioconjugated nanoparticles .
the final concentration of the purified np - antibody conjugate stock solution was 0.625 mm .
vero cells ( african green monkey kidney cells ) were grown in dulbecco s modified eagle s media ( dmem ) containing 10% fetal bovine sera ( dmem-10% ) .
for some experiments involving nps , vero cells were propagated on lab - tek chamber slides to 80%90% confluency using dmem-10% . respiratory syncytial virus strain a2 ( rsv )
rsv was diluted in dmem and the cells infected at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 1 .
the virus was allowed to adsorb for 2 h at 37 c after which dmem-10% was added and the cells incubated at 37 c for 4 days . at day 4 post - infection ( pi ) ,
the virus was recovered by removing the cell culture supernatant , freeze - thawing the infected cells , and centrifuging the cell lysate to remove debris and recover the virus from the cell lysate supernatant .
the bioconjugated nanoparticles conjugated to anti - rsv f protein monoclonal antibody ( rsv - nps ) , ie , both 585 nm and 540 nm qds , were tested for their ability to detect rsv infection of vero cells .
rsv - infected vero cells were propagated on lab - tek chamber slides to 80%90% confluency and subsequently infected with rsv at a moi = 1 as previously described ( tripp et al 1999 ) . at day
4 pi , the media from the cells was removed , the cells were washed gently with pbs , fixed with acetone : methanol ( 60:40 ) , and air dried .
rsv - nps ( diluted 1:10,000 ) were added to the cells and incubated for 1 hour at 37 c , followed by three washes with pbs/0.05% tween 20 .
cells were visualized by fluorescent microscopy ( 40x ) on an olympus ckx41 inverted microscope ( olympus , center valley , pa ) , and photographed with an olympus q - color3 digital camera .
the most widely used assay to quantitate virus titers in both the laboratory and clinical setting is the virus plaque assay .
virus plaques on the cell lawn are enumerated by immunostaining to specifically detect virus plaques due to confounding background staining that is often associated with the counterstain procedure .
rsv - nps were evaluated for detection of rsv infection using a modification of an immunostaining plaque assay as previously described ( tripp et al 1999 ) .
briefly , the modification involved substituting rsv - nps in place of the primary ( anti - rsv monoclonal antibody : clone 131 - 2a ) , secondary ( anti - mouse whole molecule immunoglobulin g ( igg)-alkaline phosphatase conjugated ) , and detection substrate , eg , vector black alkaline phosphatase , to generate a single - step nanoparticle - based assay . in this modified assay , vero cells were plated onto 24-well flat - bottom plates 24-h prior to rsv infection .
subsequently , the cell supernatants were removed and rsv diluted in dmem was added to the cells at a moi = 1 .
the virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37 c after which the cells were overlayed with 2% methylcellulose in dmem-10% as previously described ( tripp et al 1999 ) , and cells incubated for 6 days at 37 c , 5% co2 . at day
6 pi , the overlays were removed , and cells were fixed with acetone : methanol ( 60:40 ) , and allowed to air dry .
cells were blocked for 30 minutes with powerblock ( 10% casein in pbs ) at room temperature .
rsv - nps , either 540 nm or 585 nm bioconjugated qds , were diluted 1:1,000 from 0.625 mm stock solution in pbs . for positive control wells ,
anti - rsv monoclonal antibody ( clone 131 - 2a ) was diluted 1:500 in pbs containing powerblock , added to the appropriate wells , and incubated 1 hour for rsv - nps , or 2 hours for the primary monoclonal antibody at 37 c .
cells were washed 3 times with pbs/0.05% tween . for standard immunostaining plaque assay , secondary antibody ( anti - mouse igg - alkaline phosphatase conjugated ) was diluted 1:500 in powerblock , added to cells , incubated for 1 hour at 37 c , washed twice with pbs , and developed using a vector black alkaline phosphatase substrate kit according to the manufacturer s protocol . for rsv - nps
, the plates were directly scanned for virus plaques using an amersham biosciences typhoon 9210 scanner with a fluorescence excitation ( 532 nm ) and emission ( 526 sp ) filter .
the virus plaques were enumerated and compared to plaque numbers obtained by standard counting using an olympus sz dissecting scope .
to determine the ability of rsv - nps to detect rsv infection in lung tissue , the natural site of rsv infection and replication ( tripp 2005 ) , 68 week old female balb / c mice were intranasally infected with 10 plaque - forming units ( pfu ) of rsv as previously described ( tripp et al 1999 ) . at day
4 pi , rsv - infected or nave balb / c mice were intravenously administered by tail vein 0.05 ml of rsv - nps , either 540 nm or 585 nm bioconjugated qds , diluted 1:1000 in pbs from a 0.625 mm stock solution . at day
5 pi , the lungs from rsv - np - treated or pbs carrier - treated mice were removed and prepared for thin sectioning and immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) analysis as previously described ( li , sarmento , et al 2005 ) . briefly
, lung tissue was frozen as tissue blocks and sectioned ( 20 m ) on a cryostat .
the frozen sections were placed on slides which were immersed in acetone at 4 c for 15 min , air dried for 30s , and then stored in pbs until immunostaining was performed .
briefly , slides were stained with anti - rsv monoclonal antibody ( clone 131 - 2a ) diluted 1:500 in pbs and incubated for 2 h at 37 c .
the slides were washed 2 times with pbs , and a secondary antibody ( fitc conjugated anti - mouse igg ) diluted 1:500 in pbs was added to slides and incubated for 1 h at 37 c , and washed twice with pbs .
the lung sections from rsv - np - treated mice and untreated mice that were immunostained as noted above were directly visualized using a fluorescent microscope .

the lung sections from rsv - np - treated mice and untreated mice that were immunostained as noted above were directly visualized using a fluorescent microscope .
current antibody - based methods used for virus detection are cumbersome , have limited sensitivity due to substantial background staining , and are costly as they often require multiple antibodies and enzyme substrate for detection . in an effort to ameliorate these issues , and reduce the time for virus detection , we synthesized semiconductor cdte qds with emission at either 540 nm or 585 nm to be conjugated to monoclonal antibodies to detect rsv - infected cells .
these bioconjugated nps ( rsv - nps ) that are specific to rsv f protein were tested for their ability to detect rsv infection of cells both in vitro and in vivo . as expected ,
no differences in virus detection were observed using either 540 or 585 nm nps . as shown in the high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) images in figure 1 ,
the green emission cdte nps had an average size of approximately 3 nm ( a ) and the orange cdte nps of 5 nm ( b ) .
given the reported difficulties conjugating proteins to cdte nps ( tan et al 2004 ; gao et al 2005 ; mcveigh 2006 ) , the cdte nps were produced with a thioglycolate coating to allow direct anti - rsv f protein monoclonal antibody conjugation via an edc / sulfo - nhs conjugation reaction .
these bioconju - gated nps ( rsv - nps ) were stable for > 1 year at 4 c , and did not precipitate in the pbs diluent at room temperature or at 4 c . to determine the ability of the rsv - nps to detect rsv infection , in vitro studies
were performed using rsv - infected vero cells . in these studies , we compared rsv detection using conventional antibody staining methods , ie , primary and secondary antibody staining plus enzyme substrate , to that of a single - step detection method using rsv - nps . conventional antibody staining methods produced substantial background staining in mock - infected vero cells ( figure 2a )
, however did detect rsv plaque formation in the vero cell lawn ( figure 2b ) .
in contrast , rsv - nps used in a single - step method produced little background ( figure 2c ) , and readily detected rsv plaques ( figure 2d ) .
these results show that rsv - nps can be used to detect rsv in a single - step fashion , and that this method can be used to greatly reduce the amount of time and reagent needed for rsv detection compared to conventional immunostaining procedures ( tripp et al 1999 ) . extending the in vitro detection findings ( figure 2 ) , we determined if rsv - nps could be used to quantitate rsv titers in a single step fashion , thereby shortening the detection time needed to quantitate virus titers by plaque assay ( figure 3 ) . in these studies
, we compared a conventional immunostaining plaque assay which requires 5 or 6 days of in vitro culture post - rsv infection ( tripp et al 1999 ) to rapid single - step detection by rsv - nps .
for comparison of the different plaque assay methods , virus titers were assessed at days 2 , 3 , 5 , or 6 pi .
the results showed that at days 5 or 6 pi , conventional immunostaining ( figure 3a ) and the single - step rsv - np detection method ( figure 3b ) were similarly sensitive for detecting rsv plaques in the vero cell lawn .
however , rsv - nps could detect rsv plaques earlier ( days 2 or 3 pi ) compared with conventional immunostaining which was comparatively ineffective ( figure 4 ) , indicating that the single - step rsv - nps procedure was more sensitive at detecting limiting levels of rsv .
this result is not unexpected given the multivalent properties of rsv - nps . to evaluate the efficacy of rsv - nps to detect rsv infection in vivo , balb / c
were either intranasally infected with 10 pfu rsv or mock - treated , and at day 4 pi , rsv - infected or mock - treated mice were intravenously administered 0.05 ml of rsv - nps from the stock solution ( 0.625 mm ) by tail vein . at day 5
pi , the lungs from rsv - np - treated or mock - treated mice were removed , frozen , and prepared for thin sectioning and ihc analysis using conventional methods , i.e. primary and secondary antibody staining , or directly visualized by fluorescence microscopy in the case of rsv - np treatment . treatment with rsv - nps provided clear and rapid detection of rsv - infected lung tissue ( figure 5a ) with very limited background staining as assessed in lung tissue from mock - treated mice similarly administered rsv - nps ( figure 5b ) .
importantly , the magnitude and location of rsv - nps staining along the epithelial cells of the alveoli in the lungs was similar to that of conventional ihc staining ( figure 5c ) , and the background staining for rsv - nps was lower in nave mice compared to conventional ihc staining ( figure 5d ) .
the selective staining by rsv - nps of only rsv - infected lung epithelial cells suggests antibody - mediated specific targeting to sites of infection .
these results suggest that rsv - nps may be useful to determine the progression of rsv infection in the lungs , and as a result , aid our understanding of sites of infection , and help to define disease intervention strategies that employ bioconjugated np targeting strategies .
the results from this study show that rsv - nps can be used to detect rsv infection both in vitro and in vivo and suggest that beyond diagnostics , bioconjugated nps may be useful for multiplexed detection of viral and/or host cell antigens , as well as for targeting sites of virus infection with antiviral agents that may be linked to the nps .
indeed , bioconjugated nps have been used to identify the presence and progression of rsv infection in a human epithelial cell line , ie , hep-2 cells ( bentzen et al 2005 ) , as well as used in a variety of intracellular tracking and related studies ( alivisatos et al 2005 ; bruchez 2005 ; gao et al 2005 ; hotz 2005 ; shenoy et al 2006 ; mcveigh 2006 ) .
importantly , we show here that rsv - nps can be applied as tools to enhance virus detection by increasing sensitivity of virus detection while decreasing the detection time .
application of rsv - nps for virus detection in animal models can provide a path to assist our ability to dissect important parameters of rsv disease pathogenesis such as determining sites of virus infection and virus load in the lungs of infected animals .","Introduction

"this paper is the report on and balance of some thirty years of transcultural research on mood disorders .  
the aim of our work was to produce a hypothesis bringing together the different ways in which discomfort manifests itself , with special emphasis on discomfort viewed through mood symptoms .
our goal was to see if behaviours defined as pathological and which produced maladjustment in the patient in determined contexts may produce adaptive effects in different contexts and , thanks to attenuated expressions , find in these circumstances the conditions for replication and thus become factors leading to social change .
we searched for an interpretation of interactions between environment and behaviours , not from a simplistic perspective that interprets the modalities through which discomfort is expressed as the product of a culture , but by applying an evolutionary approach to see if certain behaviour patterns can be selected from the changing context ( since a static context would not modify the social significance of such patterns ) and finally to see if the very same behaviours can contribute to influencing the environment . in the case of mood disorders , this amounts to seeing how specific milieus can be adaptive for persons with temperaments or "" subthreshold "" depressive and/or expansive hyperergic symptoms .
our investigation started from h. b. murphy 's hypothesis . in the 1970s he performed an historical analysis of the descriptions of depression found in europe , collecting mostly the contributions of physicians and members of the clergy over a period of some centuries . according to murphy , the symptomatology characterized by low self - esteem , feelings of guilt and helplessness supposedly arose "" epidemically "" in a specific area of 17th - century england .
the phenomenon was already known at the time and was defined as the "" english malady "" .
prior to that time the ( rare ) descriptions of depression had concentrated on a psychosomatic symptomatology and in particular on symptoms of tiredness and loss of hope .  
the changes in symptoms coincided with a period of profound social upheaval : the geographical area was that in which the first historical form of industrialization was taking place in textile manufacturing . the social change supposedly took place on two interacting levels .
firstly , the rhythms of industrial work marked the end of the extended family typical of the rural world .
this was followed by the loss of the close identification of individuals with their group or family and the impossibility of maintaining the close emotive relationship that the extended family could provide .
the emphasis of the new society on individual responsibility was to represent the other decisive element .
the emergence of middle class morals was accompanied by the conviction that individuals were the forgers of their own destinies .
the understanding that people were able to manage and guide events emerged among the philosophers in that crucible of middle class culture that was renaissance florence ( cf .
machiavelli il principe , reprint 2006 ; pico della mirandola , oratio de hominis dignitate , in cassirer 1974 ) but it developed as 
this new interpretation of reality , this new way of perceiving the world and one 's active and important role led the development of the middle class concept of moral responsibility .
this prospect negated the idea that providence was the cause and driving force of events and saw individuals as the prime arbiters of their own destinies . since the reaching of one 's goals was to be considered the result of individual efforts , consequently defeats and failures were the result of an individual s ineptitude .
divine indulgence , according to the new protestant ethic , which took hold with the changing economy , was the reward for the hard work of the good christian .
many studies were carried out in the 1950s and 60s on depression in areas of sub - saharan africa in which cultural contacts with western societies had been limited .
thus in this context depression could not be considered a "" western "" disorder . according to henry collomb , who had transformed the fann psychiatric hospital in dakar into a sort of therapeutic village ,
depression was to be considered the most significant element in african psychopathology , although clinically the disorder was characterized by ideas of reference , persecutory delusions and psychosomatic symptoms .
the ideas of guilt , self - depreciation and suicidal behaviours contrasted with "" western "" depressive symptomatology .  
an element of extreme interest in this scenario was reported by field , who documented an epidemic of a depression - like disorder in an area of ghana inhabited by ashanti people .
murphy   interpreted the innovation as a sort of hybrid pathological manifestation combining the traditional psychosomatic discomfort and the innovative pathology apparently introduced by economic individualism represented by the emergence of guilt symptoms , although this was in a context in which these elements were not yet ascribable to a presumed individual conscience as opposed to a more "" collective "" one related to the concomitant social transformation and the beginning of cacao production on an industrial scale .
the hypothesis advanced by the school of dakar was that the specificity of western africa in expressing discomfort depended on how the main mother - child and community - individual relationships brought about a sort of symbiotic personality . from this standpoint ,
the characteristics of the personality were considered to be directly correlated to the way of expressing discomfort , that is , feeling bad and being sad was tantamount to feeling split up , separated from the group the person belonged to and thus threatened and persecuted .
the psychodynamic authors of the 1960s attributed the cause of this particular african depressive pathology to the absence of an individual super - ego : the constant presence of caregiving figures may have determined the development of a collective super - ego [ 9 , 10 ] .
later , the sociologist zempleni - rabain pointed out that the education of children in western africa emphasized the sense of belonging .
more recently , thanks to cooperation between the regional centre of traditional medicine of bandiagara and the university of berkeley , the extensive relationship between mother and child was studied by means of aetiological models derived from the  strange situation  in a dogon village in mali .
a study performed by the school of dakar   observed that senegalese emigrants who had moved to dakar from rural areas were found to be protected from the psychopathological risk connected with migration by the effect of social cohesion thanks to the associative structures of the islamic brotherhoods .
these institutions were thought to represent the social manifestation of the community s attitude towards personality in a syncretic islamism still imbued with magic and religious elements .
sylla and mbaye studied the modalities by which these networks modulated the need for group unity , the necessity to emigrate and psychological risk among western african populations , especially the wolofs of senegal . the departure to seek work
the social significance of the ritual is that of creating a bond that places the individual under the control of the mother or wife in the mother country .
since the family depends on the remittances that the emigrant sends from abroad , it is fundamental to have a ritual that modulates the effects of an experience that risks being strongly centrifugal with respect to the community .
it is believed that the emigrant can be recalled thanks to a ceremony called wotal ; if he does not respond he will lose his mental health .
thanks to this bond the family can be sure of receiving periodic remittances from the family member abroad : distance does not break the bond with the group to which the emigrant belongs .
offers in money to the brotherhood also exonerate the emigrant from the obligation to remain at home . according to the koran , emigration to places where the true faith is not practised is allowed only for religious reasons .
almost all senegalese emigrants with psychotic disorders observed starting from the 1990s in our centre were convinced that they were influenced by the wotal .
the clinical pictures were characterized by bouffes with persecutory - like delusions and mental confusion .
the onset of an episode was perceived as a breaking of the symbiotic bond with the group .
it is thus not therapeutically surprising that on the return to senegal of a relative with a psychotic maladjustment a series of traditional rituals are performed by family and friends to remove the negative effects of the wotal . in a study performed in sardinia
[ 15 , 16 ] , a random sample of senegalese street traders , whose work made community life possible , did not appear to be at risk of depression any more than sardinian controls .
unexpectedly , a high frequency of anxiety and depressive disorders was found in the few senegalese who had found regular jobs and pay . a strong determinant associated with
the onset of the psychopathology was , in this second case , the loss of contact with their fellow senegalese and the breaking away from the brotherhood .
compared to a population of moroccan emigrants employed in similar jobs , the senegalese street traders presented a lower risk of depression as well as a lower incidence of psychopathological episodes in the first months after their arrival in sardinia .
the observations on african emigrants encouraged our group to perform a series of in - the - field studies in africa .
this is where a research centre funded by italian cooperation for development and the centre rgional de mdicine traditionnelle was set up .
the cooperative project proposed to use the principles of dogon herbal medicines to produce low - cost drugs .
the method of testing the efficacy and standardizing the active ingredients was introduced based on the traditional empirical grounds of western scientific culture . from this standpoint ,
a study conducted together with local medicine men was indispensable to compare traditional nosography with western disease classifications .
it was necessary to understand which active ingredients could be useful and for which disease .
it emerged that depressive and anxiety disorders were unknown and not taken into consideration by the medicine men . on the plateau
they either did not exist or were not considered as falling within the scope of the system of treatment .
laboriously , and with the help of many linguists , we translated some of the epidemiological instruments used in europe in epidemiological investigations of mental health .
we then performed a study to verify the presence of depression on the dogon plateau .
it was a study conducted using western nosological criteria but with the intention of comparing them to the interpretive modalities of the culture under examination , studied according to the approach that anthropologists and new transcultural psychiatrists would define as dialectic between "" etic "" and "" emic "" .
the population studied lived in a very poor sahelian area in nomadic camps ( the peuls ) or villages ( the dogons ) with no electricity , organized transport or communications systems .
thus we are dealing with a study of extreme interest owing to its singularity , albeit next to impossible to replicate .
numerous observations in western africa appear , in faft , to indicate a progressive change , today , in psychopathology , especially in circles that are urban and literate in the western sense [ 22 , 23 ] .
the prevalence of depressive disorders found the dogon plateau was lower than what have found in studies performed in europe with similar instruments or in africa in urban contexts or in conditions of war [ 24 , 25 ] . among the illiterates , who were a consistent part of the cohort
, most depressed individuals also suffered from somatic disorders that had begun prior to the onset of the psychiatric disorder .
the study showed the importance of somatic diseases as a risk factor for depression when the reproductive role ( as in the case of parasitic infections of the genitourinary tract ) or the social or family role ( as in the case of heart diseases and tuberculosis ) have been affected .
thus , in the societies studied , we may find a behavioural pattern similar , but not identical , to our depressive patterns .
but this is rare , probably because its onset requires a triggering condition of higher impact .
moreover , in agreement with what has been demonstrated by other studies , depression is not considered a disease and thus does not fall within conventional or traditional treatment systems . a later work   aimed at characterizing the syndromic aggregations by means of a sophisticated statistical method based on how a symptom is more likely to occur associated with one or more symptoms .
the results suggest a non - superimposition of the depressive phenomenology most frequently found on the dogon plateau on the psychological profiles usually found in western contexts .
it also appears to confirm the existence of two opposing ways of expressing the discomfort which are most likely "" culturally determined "" . one way is more frequent and characterized by psychoastenic symptoms with persecutory overtones , while the other , similar to depression as we in industrialized countries know it , is found in literate persons .
the bandiagara study suggests that social factors influence the manifestation of the melancholy phenomenology and perhaps they may affect the risk of becoming depressed , but it does not allow us to formulate any hypothesis explaining how this may come about .
some elements of interest on this subject are presented in the results of an investigation carried out in the namwera area in malawi , bordering on mozambique . in this region ,
inhabited by yao and chicewa peoples , the economy was prevalently based on farming and only at the time of the study had other occupations emerged .
malawi was in fact the only african country that had maintained a strongly traditional political structure up to the 1990s ; urbanization had been opposed by the central government , which had officially acknowledged the village chief as its representative .
it is one of the poorest countries in the world with the highest rate of hiv infections .
however , at the time of the study , malawi had undergone profound transformations involving micro- and macrosocial aspects and which , in the following years , had led to the setting up of a democracy with different political parties determined by a referendum . in a world that had not changed for centuries , these changes had a strong emotive impact on most of the population . in the period just before the referendum ,
mc lachlan had observed and described an authentic epidemic of forms of hysteria in groups of young women . according to the only western psychopathologist present , these phenomena were to be considered directly related to the hyper - involvement caused by conflict in the choice between tradition and innovation .
the hysterical crises invariably began with triggering events brought on by occurrences connected with the referendum , such as political rallies and public debates . in this context , starting from 1988 , an industrial apparel initiative planned and financed by italian cooperation had been set up in the village of namwera . at the beginning
, the project foresaw that after a training period women could purchase the machines required for setting up an independent dressmaking activity in their villages of origin . in consideration of the peculiar condition of women in the yao and chicewa cultures , the sudden passage from a traditional role to one that was to some extent entrepreneurial appeared to be a situation appropriate for studying aspects concerning the relationship between transformation of the self and psychopathological modifications .  
the investigation concerned three cohorts of women matched by age : one included all the dressmakers , another with women employed in traditional occupations ( farmers / housewives ) and the third with nurses and midwives .
the history of development , the presence of stressful events and other risk factors , such as the presence of psychopathological symptoms and evident psychiatric disorders , were studied ; interpretations of the causes of any discomfort found were defined .
the choice of the kind of non - traditional work made by the young women was in line with their personal histories of development .
in fact , those who were employed in innovative jobs ( dressmakers and nurses ) had suffered abandonment by the father at an early age ( in more than 80% of the two cohorts ) . in malawi
, marriage is matrilocal : the man moves to his wife 's home , but he often abandons the family , leaving it in precarious economic conditions . in the young dressmakers and nurses the choice of an innovative occupation was probably dictated by economic needs and subsistence .
satisfaction with their work was higher in the women who had chosen innovative occupations ( dressmakers and nurses ) but only the dressmakers ( and not the nurses ) manifested a series of social conflicts connected with their new roles , such as difficulty in finding a stable partner and frequent abandonment by husbands who refused to accept the wife 's work , and this is surprising in consideration of the economic stability that the new activity offered . on the level of psychopathological evaluation
they presented more psychopathological symptoms and , among these , the number of cases of depression diagnosed on the basis of the dsm - iiir manual was higher . among the housewives ,
a statistical analysis of the distribution of the specific symptoms revealed more frequent "" psychosomatic "" symptoms ( headaches , lack of appetite , poor digestion ) , excessive tiredness , loss of interest and difficulty in concentrating , ideas of devaluation , conviction that others did not acknowledge the importance of their roles and that an insult by someone may have caused the problems .
they thus showed a tendency to suffer from a lack of respect by others and to localize externally the causes of their malaise .
the dressmakers more often felt tense , nervous and worried ; they experienced sensations of uselessness and more frequently expressed a wish to die .
more than in the control groups , problems involving self - esteem and the more conventional symptoms of depression emerged .
some interesting psychosocial studies suggest that cultural transmission tends to remain when the specific cultural institutions ( in the case of the namwera study the occupational role ) are perceived by the persons involved ( and by the other members of the group ) as an integral part of their own personal identity , but at the same time as capable of responding to new exigencies and needs ( "" the evolving self "" ) . in the case of the namwera study
this interpretation would explain the absence of external and internal conflicts connected with the new role and , consequently , the nurses ' in integrating into it .
they receive a good salary but maintain a social role similar to that of the female tradition . on the contrary
, the dressmakers , who were involved in a more individualistic occupation that was farther removed from women s traditional role , appeared to suffer more from the burden of an activity completely different in terms of individual responsibility and one that was probably less acceptable in the social and family context . in interpreting the results we must take into consideration that a nurse 's work appears to allow a namwera woman to maintain an acceptable social role , one that is also perceived as being closer to women 's "" traditional "" roles , especially as concerns care for and support of the weak
thus it is not surprising that nurses form the emotionally most stable group , since they have reached a satisfactory economic situation which provides them with independence and autonomy , while maintaining them in an individually and socially acceptable role which is also innovative .
we can also hypothesize that extreme needs , such as those caused by abandonment by a father , can cause inclined individuals to assume the onus of the problems of the micro - group and take a "" step forward "" ( new occupation or emigration ) .
the choice of the new activity brings with it the risk of a breakaway from tradition if not adequately mediated .
the cultural change would thus offer opportunities for success of individuals who are "" desperate , explorative and super - responsible "" ( with "" compulsive hyper - responsibilization "" in bowlbian terms )   while in other circumstances "" unperturbed "" by the change , they would probably be destined to undergo social humiliation .
the social change from an evolutionary standpoint may also form the substrate that favours , selects and amplifies the frequency of behaviour of this kind . at the same time , this exposes to decompensation : the step may be rewarded , but those who take it are more at risk : they are alone on a new road and do not have the support of the group , which no longer recognizes them and tends to isolate them .
the model may explain not only the transformation of the symptoms ( centred on responsibility and guilt ) but also the supposed increase in depression in western society .
the supposed increase in depression in western societies can not in fact be explained by "" ingenuous "" biological and genetic hypotheses : it is irrational if not interpreted from a complex socio - biological standpoint .
if depression were simply caused by genetic vulnerability we could not explain why a condition that afflicts persons who live shorter lives and give birth to fewer children does not disappear , but according to some has seen a continuous increase from the 17th century to the present .
some studies appear to demonstrate it : the swedish study repeated over time by lundby ; the analysis of data of the national study in the united states conducted in the 1980s which , however , is a cross - sectional study ; a study at the general practitioner level in the united kingdom covering about thirty years . however , there are studies that do not appear to confirm this trend , such as the well - known study repeated over time in stirling county , nova scotia [ 35 , 36 ] .
more recently , the two studies performed on a population sample in the united states ( of what first evaluation in 1992 and repeated in 2002 ) , and the australian study in new south wales ( first evaluation in 1998 and repeated in 2008 ) , appear undoubtedly to confirm the hypothesis of an increase in the prevalence and incidence of depression at least in the last few decades .
sardinians , apparently , go in the opposite direction : this emerges from the data of our latest study performed in a sardinian mining district with three estimates of the frequency of depression in the overall population in 1988 , 1998 and 2008 .
the pervasiveness of depression clearly appears to be decreasing in the last twenty years and , at least in the last ten years , the comparison with the first investigation needs to be considered with more caution in the light of the different interviewing method used and the fact that the diagnostic system had changed . in the ten years preceding the first study the area had seen a 50% decrease in the population in forty years .
we have asked ourselves whether this decrease against the general trend has been caused by selective migration , that is , the departure of persons who were in some way "" vulnerable "" to depression .
a certain popular literature has underscored that migration may select persons with "" hypomanic temperaments "" .
gartner , in his book  the link between ( a little ) craziness and ( a lot of ) success in america    advances the hypothesis that success in america is due to immigrants who are more ambitious , determined , creative and resistant to frustration than others .
the author , a psychiatrist well - known to the media , argues that emigrants are more frequently persons with hypomanic traits .
this is an apparently "" naive "" theory , but one that may confirm what we stated as concerns the results in the mining district .
we must in fact consider that persons with a hypo - manic temperament are more exposed than others to depressive episodes .
i defined gartner 's theory as naive because we can not argue that all emigrants leave for similar reasons and with the same determination to accept a challenge .
it is sufficient to consider refugees who are forced to abandon their homes rather than choosing to leave them .
to arrive at a better understanding of the dynamics of possible selective , we attempted to study the specificity of sardinian emigration . in the 1960s ,
nereide rudas studied attitudes towards migration in sardinian couples who were about to leave for germany , france and northern italy [ 41 , 42 ] . the decision to emigrate
the wives often did not agree completely , but bowed to the will of their spouses .
although in our culture women have a voice in decision - making within the family , generally speaking they are more respectful of traditions and probably for this reason they were less enthusiastic about leaving . on the average , the migrating women had less self - esteem than the men .
a long time after the first study we performed research on sardinian immigrants in paris at the beginning of the 1990s .
most of these persons came from the northern ogliastra and barbagia regions ; they had left in the 1960s and 70s from sheep raising areas of those regions which were poor and at that time with few prospects for the future .
the study compared the frequency of psychopathological disorders in a cohort of sardinians residing in sardinia , in a cohort of sardinians residing in paris and in a cohort of parisians .
the sardinians in sardinia were found to be more frequently anxious and the parisians more often depressed .
the emigrants were in the worst condition : they were as anxious as the sardinians who had remained at home and there were more cases of depression ; the young males were those most prone to depression .
the depressive symptoms , especially among the young males , were frequently associated with substance abuse and anxiety disorders and more often chronic compared to depressed parisians .
the passage from a static society with few opportunities to one with many opportunities , but highly competitive , appeared to increase the risk , especially in males , and even more in young males . a similar study conducted in a completely different situation , that of the economic collapse in argentina , the investigation had been conducted at la plata and in the south of the province of buenos aires in december 2001 and in 2002 , showed that the young male sardinian immigrants were not the ones at risk . in these specific circumstances those at risk were the women over the age of forty - five , the group traditionally considered the most vulnerable to major depressive disorders . in conclusion ,
a condition offering many opportunities , especially for young men who are competitive and full of initiative , appears to place at risk some of the very youths that the condition should favour .
this recalls the theory of goal striving stress described by kleiner and parker : a society that creates great expectations produces stress in those who fail to reach their goals .
a society in full economic and social catastrophe represents a risk for adult women emigrants . these were women who had not chosen to emigrate and who , at the time of departure , had less self - confidence than the men
if we hypothesize that mood disorders are increasing and that the forms of them we know have appeared as mass phenomena at least starting from the 17th century , we must also postulate that at least the "" minor "" forms must have an adaptive advantage ( otherwise the disorder would have disappeared ) . ""
compulsive hyper - responsabilization  may represent an adaptive substrate in certain conditions of social change . after becoming entrepreneurs
, many young namwera seamstresses improved their economic and social status in the 1990s , just as many sardinians who today have reached a solid social position in paris , but who in those years faced a difficult challenge in a world completely different from their traditional one . a certain attitude towards challenges and hyperactivity
although social interactions may have caused , such as in the case of the sardinians pairs , the selection of women rated to pessimism and the sense of duty . at the same time new opportunities may also appear as risky : those who accept challenges can reach new goals , but are also exposed to a greater risk of defeat compared to those who remain in their traditional roles or do not emigrate .
 selected people also expressed their suffering in a new , more "" individualistic "" way .
the social changes that favour compulsive hyper - responsibilization are those that disrupt the support "" extended "" to the individual : this social hypothesis comes from murphy s theories and , in agreement with the results of the namwera study , it is perfectly in line with researches on human ethology which  anxious avoidant attachment  to a greater exploratory attitude but also to an increased risk of depression .
a similar model can explain how the accent on individualism and responsibility has changed not only the frequency , but also the phenomenology of mood disorders .
what emerges is the increase in our culture of depression among young men ( not only in the paris investigation , but also in many european , north american and australian studies [ 37 , 38 , 48 ] ) ; the increase in forms of co - morbidity , especially with substance addiction and anxiety ( an element not isolated in our studies ) may give weight to the theory of the increase in bipolar disorders . because , is doubtable that common epidemiologic tools have ability to detect between bipolar depressive episodes and major depressive episodes [ 49 - 51 ] .  
the sociobiologically determined roles of gender and their interaction may also increase the level of complexity . a couple composed of a hyper - explorative male and
a traditionally protective female undoubtedly presents adaptive advantages in particular contexts of tumultuous changes , such as those that occur in an unfamiliar world in a couple of migrants , as has been described in studies on sardinians .
it is reasonable to expect that different social conditions are capable of triggering specific vulnerabilities in the two sexes and that the interaction between environment and hormonal structure may produce the different psychopathological expression .
the socioeconomic context found in paris in our investigation recalls scenarios common to europe in the last forty years .
the "" argentine model "" appears to reflect that of europe in the next ten years .
there will be a new change in the phenomenology of mood disorders in the future ?","INTRODUCTION

"c1q nephropathy is a proliferative glomerulopathy characterized by extensive c1q mesangial deposition in the clinical setting of steroid - resistant proteinuria ( 1 ) . so far ,
its etiology is not well - known , and the case reports associated with infection have been rare . epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) is a ubiquitous human herpes virus that causes infectious mononucleosis .
in addition to the classic triad of fever , pharyngitis , and lymphadenopathy , patients with infectious mononucleosis due to acute ebv infection may develop various complications in various organs including hemolytic anemia , granulocytopenia , hepatitis , pericarditis , encephalitis , and acute interstitial nephritis ( 2 , 3 ) .
in addition , development of glomerulonephritis in a patient with chronic active ebv infection has been also reported ( 4 ) . a three - year old boy with proteinuria during acute phase of infectious mononucleosis went through a renal biopsy , and
furthermore , the family history of dent 's disease incurred more confusion into the evaluation of proteinuria .
a three - year old , previously healthy boy was brought to us because of intermittent fever for seven days and foamy urine for five days . on admission ,
a few thumb tip - sized cervical lymph nodes were detected bilaterally , which were non - tender and movable .
the edge of the liver was sharp , and the surface was smooth without tenderness .
one of his maternal cousins had proteinuria since age of three and was diagnosed as having dent 's disease by genetic testing .
his maternal grandfather also had a history of proteinuria since childhood , and developed chronic renal failure several years before .
initial laboratory investigations revealed : hemoglobin 10.4 g / dl , platelet 191,000/l , and wbc 24,710/l ( neutrophils 21% , lymphocytes 44% , atypical lymphocytes 28% , and monocytes 7% ) .
the blood biochemistry results were as follows ; blood urea nitrogen 11 mg / dl , creatinine 0.4 mg / dl , total protein 7.4 g / dl , albumin 4.2 g / dl , and aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , and alkaline phosphatase were 98 , 153 , and 565 iu / l , respectively .
ebv vca igm ab was positive , and other viral markers including hepatitis b virus , hepatitis c virus , hepatitis a virus and cytomegalovirus were all negative .
urinalysis revealed two positive albuminuria with some hyaline and granular casts , but hematuria was not detected .
urinary protein excretion was 2,780 mg / day , and urinary calcium excretion was 2.7 mg / kg / day .
urinary 2-microglobulin was 163 g / ml . the urinary protein electrophoresis revealed : albumin 34.9% and total globulin 65.1% .
the sds - page of urine protein showed a mixed glomerular and tubular pattern of proteinuria .
serum igg , iga , and igm were 1,590 , 153 , and 230 mg / dl , respectively .
aso titer , anti - double strands - dna , and rheumatoid factor were negative .
initially , ebv infection was easily diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and the positive serologic test .
in addition , severe low - molecular weight proteinuria supported the possibility of underlying dent 's disease .
however , nephrotic range proteinuria with a considerable proportion of albuminuria could not be explained by ebv infection and/or underlying dent 's disease .
however , electron microscopic examination disclosed a small amount of mesangial deposits with focal moderate effacement of epithelial foot processes .
immunofluorescence microscopic examination revealed mesangial c1q ( + + ) and igg ( + ) deposits with a granular pattern ( fig .
the mutational analysis of the clcn5 gene revealed a c - to - t point mutation that replaces the 637th codon of arginine to a stop codon .
this nonsense mutation was the same one detected in his maternal cousin previously ( the patient 1 in reference 5 ) .
leukocytosis and abnormal liver function were normalized within seven days with conservative management , and atypical lymphocytosis disappeared completely within three weeks .
however , proteinuria persisted , and enalapril ( 2 mg / kg / day ) was started by the twentieth day of hospitalization , which decreased the urine protein / creatinine ratio by approximately 50% a after six months .
follow - up of ebv serologic markers after a month revealed positive vca - igm , vca - igg , and ea(dr)-igg antibodies .
about five months later , negative conversion of vca - igm ab and positive conversion of ebna - igg ab were noted .
c1q nephropathy is a controversial disease entity that was first defined by its unusual immunopathologic characteristics ( 1 ) .
mostly acceptable diagnostic criteria of c1q nephropathy are mesangial immune deposits that stain dominantly or co - dominantly for c1q , corresponding mesangial electron dense deposits on electron microscopic examination , and the clinical setting of steroid - resistant proteinuria without evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) .
the light microscopic findings are traditionally accepted by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in most patients and minimal change lesion in others ( 7 ) .
however , some recent studies suggested that c1q nephropathy was an entity that histologically is within the minimal change disease or a focal segmental glomeanlosclerosis ( fsgs ) and appears to show the full spectrum of histological variants seen in fsgs ( 8 , 9 ) .
although there was a case report ( 10 ) of de novo c1q nephropathy in a graft kidney in association with human polyoma ( bk ) virus interstitial nephritis , association with other virus including ebv was absent .
( 11 ) reported a case of c1q nephropathy in a 23-month - old girl with steroid - dependent nephrotic syndrome as the first case in korea .
ebv infection may induce renal diseases , most frequently acute interstitial nephritis during the course of infectious mononucleosis .
occasional occurrences of glomerular diseases such as iga nephropathy , steroid - dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome , and hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients with infectious mononucleosis have also been reported ( 12 ) .
in addition , post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorders caused by ebv frequently involve the graft ( 13 ) .
although there have been no previous case report of c1q nephropathy in association with infectious mononucleosis and a the in situ hybridization result was negative , the causal relationship between ebv infection and c1q nephropathy can not be completely excluded in our patient on the basis of coincidental onset of infectious mononucleosis and the foamy urine and the frequent negative result of in situ hybridization in ebv - induced nephritis ( 3 )
. there has been controversies about the effect of steroid treatment for c1q nephropathy ( 1 , 6 , 14 , 15 ) . in our patient , steroid therapy was not undertaken due to active ebv infection .
dent 's disease , a renal tubular disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the clcn5 gene encoding the clc-5 chloride channel expressed in tubular epithelial cells , is characterized by low - molecular - weight proteinuria , hypercalciuria , nephrocalcinosis / nephrolithiasis , and progressive renal failure ( 5 , 16 , 17 ) .
the tubular component of proteinuria in our patient was thought to have resulted from underlying dent 's disease .
the possible harmful influence of underlying dent 's disease on the course of c1q nephropathy should be determined by a long - term follow - up of the patient .","INTRODUCTION

"anti - n - methyl - d - aspartate ( anti - nmda ) receptor encephalitis is an acute , immune - mediated paraneoplastic syndrome with a characteristic sequential clinical course .
it includes a prodrome of flu - like illness progressing to behavior changes , psychosis , and memory deficit .
dyskinesia , seizure attacks , deteriorated consciousness level , and autonomic instability may be seen in later stages.14 patients may gradually recover , with these symptoms resolving in reverse order.14 dalmau s group first described anti - nmda receptor encephalitis in 2005 and suggested that it was an acute , female - predominant ( 81% ) autoimmune encephalitis.1,2 about half of the patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis had underlying neoplasms , with ovarian teratomas ( 94% ) being the most common.13 a recent large cohort study demonstrated that milder severity of symptoms , no need for intensive care , early immunotherapy , and prompt tumor removal were good prognostic factors.3 half of the patients had improvement in symptoms within 4 weeks after early immunotherapy . in another case report , the authors noted that steroid usage 3 months after onset of symptoms also resulted in significant improvements.3,5 the recovery phase might last for 18 months or longer.34 to maximize a patient s functional outcome , clinical practitioners need to be aware of this potentially curable disease and its common sequelae in order to organize rational , individualized rehabilitation programs.6,7 we report the long - term course of a young pediatric patient with recalcitrant anti - nmda receptor encephalitis and prolonged length of stay in hospital for 7 months .
a young girl aged 3 years 2 months and without known medical or psychiatric history was admitted to our hospital due to personality changes that had persisted for 2 weeks .
her condition progressed over the course of 12 days to behavioral regression , unsteady gait , headache , irritable crying , catatonia - like response , generalized choreoathetoid movements , orofacial dyskinesia , and collapsed lung , in successive order . as a result , she was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit .
her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white - matter lesions over bilateral frontal lobes ( figure 1 ) .
a complete etiologic investigation showed insufficient evidence of bacterial infection , electrolyte imbalance , intoxication , or endocrine disturbances . at first , under the clinical suspicion of meningoencephalitis , she was empirically treated with acyclovir plus azithromycin .
after a cerebrospinal fluid nmda receptor antibody study reported positive results , the antibiotics were shifted to intravenous immunoglobulin for two courses , followed by pulse methylprednisolone therapy ( 30 mg / kg / dose , four doses ) and maintenance oral prednisolone ( 0.9 mg / kg / day ) .
her choreoathetosis and orofacial dyskinesia recovered partially for several weeks , but these symptoms reappeared after we discontinued prednisolone because of her episodic sepsis , autonomic instability , and poorly - controlled gastrointestinal bleeding .
the pediatric neurologist prescribed plasmaphoresis about 3 months after onset of symptoms , but it was discontinued because of anaphylactic reactions and bilateral pneumonia with collapsed lung .
she received a combination therapy of weekly rituximab ( 375 mg / m , four doses ) and prolonged monthly cyclophosphamide pulse therapy ( 750 mg / m , 8 months ) , followed by azathioprine for 3 months . for her inpatient rehabilitation program , passive range - of - motion exercise was performed for her during periods of protracted sedation to prevent contracture .
after cyclophosphamide and rituximab was applied for 6 weeks , her troublesome generalized choreoathetosis attenuated gradually .
we started intensive facilitation and postural training after tapering off the sedative agents . in order to prevent oral dyskinesia - related aspiration and pneumonia
the patient was discharged after a 7-month period of hospitalization , which required maximal assistance in mobility , self - care , and cognition domains as measured with the functional independence measure for children .
for her outpatient rehabilitation , we arranged fixed physical , occupational , and speech therapists with whom she was familiar , and we placed her in an isolated setting to avoid distracting stimuli that might deteriorate her attention span , emotional status , and behavioral outbursts . at 12 months after the onset of symptoms , she had merely achieved the developmental age of 68 months in terms of gross - motor and fine - motor milestones and 912 months in terms of cognition .
she could obey some simple verbal orders but was mute most of the time , with cognitive deficits considered to be the main cause .
over the next 6 months , sequential programs such as toy - based training for postural control , imitation learning , matching training , and treadmill ambulation with partial body - weight support produced significant improvement .
her gross - motor skills progressed to the developmental milestone of 2427 months , her fine - motor movements improved to 2023 months , and her cognition advanced to 2429 months . she could deal with simple self - care tasks , but occasional incontinence was still noted .
she could speak more than five words and expressed herself correspondingly . the physical therapy with tricycle riding and
balance - beam exercise continued according to the patient s tolerance . in order to improve her cognitive deficits , psychological evaluation and training such as cognitive  behavioral therapy for attention , memory , and emotion regulation
were added to her programs . the initial assessment for her intelligence quotient ( iq ) , measured by wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence ,
was reported as mild mental retardation ( full iq = 62 ) , with performance iq out of proportion to her scale in verbal iq ( scores were 58 and 71 , respectively ) .
after 28 months of rehabilitation , the patient reached full development in gross - motor milestones , regained control of continence sphincters , and was able to communicate in complete sentences with improved reasoning .
three years after onset of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis , the iq test showed no significant change except for performance iq improvement from 58 to 64 .
she still had residual sequelae of mild mental retardation , and she had a mildly impulsive personality and was easily distracted .
the typical presentations of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis could be divided into eight categories in decreasing order of prevalence , including acute behavioral or cognitive change , movement disorder , memory deficit , speech disorder , seizure , decreased level of consciousness , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation . in an observational cohort study , about 87% of patients shared similar symptoms that included four or more of the eight categories within the first 4 weeks.3 definite diagnosis for this disease was the presence of nmda receptor antibodies in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid ( 100% sensitivity ) or serum ( 85% sensitivity).2,3 reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid antibodies appeared to be correlated to a better clinical outcome.2,8 there were no correlations between different domains of symptoms , extent of disease progression , and brain mri findings , with only 33%50% of patients showing nonspecific abnormalities on standard mri.2,3 one recent functional mri study proposed that reduced functional connectivity between bilateral hippocampus may predict memory performance , and that extensive white - matter changes in diffusion tensor imaging might correlate to the disease severity.9 the acronym  nmdar  is useful as a mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis :  n  for nonspecific prodrome , 
r  for respiration depression . early detection of this disease and confirmed diagnosis with nmda receptor antibodies ensures early intervention and better recovery .
the recommended first - line immunotherapies were corticosteroid , intravenous immunoglobulin , and plasmaphoresis . about 60% of patients achieved good outcomes with minor functional deficits remaining after first - line therapy or tumor removal.3 the second - line immunotherapies , which include rituximab and cyclophosphamide ,
were recommended to be started if patients failed to respond to first - line therapies after no more than 4 weeks,2,3 and resulted in a response rate of approximately 78%.3 full recovery and fewer neurological relapses were more frequently seen in patients with teratoma that had been removed.2,3,10 the general relapsing rate was 12%24% within the first 2 years , and overall mortality rate was 4%9.5%.2,3 a search of relevant articles was conducted on pubmed ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) , medline ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) and embase ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) , using 
anti - nmda receptor encephalitis  or  autoimmune encephalitis  as search terms . in the current literature ,
the age of onset for anti - nmda receptor encephalitis ranged from 8 months to 85 years.3,11 adult patients more often presented with memory deficits , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation .
in contrast , children younger than 12 years of age generally presented with behavioral or cognitive changes , involuntary movements , speech disorders , ataxia , and hemiparesis.3 consistent with recent literature for young patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis , we did not identify any underlying tumor for our patient .
these symptoms even persisted an additional 6 weeks after the start of second - line immunotherapy .
the severity and duration of the movement disorders might be a reflection of the encephalitis severity.3,6 it could be worthwhile to arrange a comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation program for ill children who do not fit the good - outcome predictors , because their prognosis might still be favorable , such as the case we have reported .
the ideal treatment goals for patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis are to accomplish stable medical condition , attain functional goals , and achieve good family training.6 the children in several studies had multiple impairments at the time of hospital discharge , especially deficits in delicate motor skills and cognition , and were deemed as needing further outpatient rehabilitation.6,7,12 goal - oriented training based on a multidisciplinary approach and individualized programs in physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training provided better functional outcomes and might shorten the rehabilitation time course.6,7 in the current case , physical performance , nonverbal reasoning , and fluid intelligence were often impaired but all of them had fair to good response to training . on the contrary
, problems such as the patient s short attention span were frustrating . because cognitive recovery was significantly impaired despite recovery in other neurological deficits , compensating cognitive deficits might be a core concept for late - phase rehabilitation.6 family education about rational goals and the importance of strictly carrying out cognitive - behavioral therapy at home might also be helpful .
moreover , an individualized education program to address a child s distraction , delayed information interpretation speed , and learning difficulty is also suggested to be executed in school.6 most articles about anti - nmda receptor encephalitis in the literature described the presentation of symptoms , diagnostic process , follow - up antibody titers , and neurological status . however , none of them described long - term rehabilitation strategies for these patients ; only two articles described inpatient rehabilitation programs in seven patients.6,7 our report highlights the sequential functional changes experienced by the young patient during the 28 months of rehabilitation ( both inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation ) , and pointed out the possible challenges during the rehabilitative programs .
even so , the interventions and therapies described here may not be useful for all patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis . in cases of encephalitis of unknown cause and with characteristic symptoms
, treatable anti - nmda receptor encephalitis should be taken into consideration and further intervention must be performed as early as possible .
comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs , including physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training , are usually necessary for these patients and , generally , a good outcome can be expected .","Introduction

"adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( ais ) is a disease of unknown aetiology , characterized by a complex three - dimensional deformation of the spinal column as the most common paediatric orthopaedic pathology .
its incidence , according to different sources , varies from 2 to 6% of the total paediatric population , while 3 in 1000 adolescents require severe reconstructive spinal surgery .
ais is characterized by its relationship with the pubertal period , its much higher incidence in adolescent girls as compared with boys ( from 1  :  7 to 1  :  10 according to various authors ) , and poor prediction of the course of the disease .
the process of deformation can stop spontaneously without treatment at some point , but it can also progress rapidly up to an angle of 70 degrees or more [ 1 , 2 ] .
although the first mention of scoliosis goes back as far as hippocrates ( c. 460370 bc ) , to date there is no factual , scientifically feasible theory of ais aetiology and pathogenesis .
accordingly , there are no reliable methods for predicting the extent and rate of spinal deformation , nor for its effective treatment and prevention
.   one of the main reasons for this state is the lack of an effective model reproducing all the specific features of the pathological process in animals .
conventional animal models ( peripheral nerve disruption , muscle extirpation , vertebral and intertverebral disc lesions , etc . ) are artificial to a considerable extent , so that their results can not be satisfactorily transferred into clinical practice .  
the most effective scoliosis models are those of pinealectomized chickens   and bipedal infant rats .
it was shown that removal of the pineal gland in chickens leads to stage - by - stage three - dimensional deformation of the spinal column , as in humans .
the authors interpreted development of experimental scoliosis as a result of disturbance of the symmetrical growth of spine and paraspinal muscles , due to disturbance of melatonin synthesis .
the same results were obtained in experiments on rats , which , at the birth of resected front paws and tail , caused the animal to move on two hind legs ( bipedal rats ) .
thus , researchers have obtained a model of a mammal with the vertical spinal column .
however , the mechanism of this deformation in experimental model is still disputable [ 68 ] .   in some experimental work administration of the hormone melatonin ,
normally secreted by the pineal gland , to pinealectomized animals was shown to prevent deformation ; while in other works this claim is disputed .
was reported in the blood of children with ais ; however , an attempt to administer melatonin to such children ( a sort of substitution therapy ) was ineffective .
other authors   found no significant differences in blood concentrations of this hormone and melatonin metabolites in the urine of healthy children compared with that of children with ais .
positron emission tomography ( pet ) studies also failed to reveal any differences in metabolic intensity in a pineal gland area in patients with ais compared with that of healthy controls .
thus , the only evidence is that the removal of the melatonin - producing pineal gland with the resulting failure of melatonin production in growing animals with a vertical spine leads to scoliosis similar to that observed in humans .
muscle tone changes due to disrupted sleep - wake cycles or homeostasis [ 4 , 13 ] are considered by the majority of specialists to be entirely irrelevant to these phenomena .  
the main objective of the present work was to study the functioning of brain structures which regulate melatonin secretion in patients with ais , using electrophysiology methods in order to better understand ais aetiopathogenesis and possibly to develop methods for the prevention , treatment , and prognosis of the deformation process .
the main group contained 292 children with ais of varied severity ( 44 children , grade i ; 109 children , grade ii ; 105 , grade iii ; 34 , grade iv ) , and the control group consisted of 46 healthy children of the same age group .
all were patients at the ogonyok rehabilitation center of pediatric orthopedics and traumatology during 20062009 .
the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the ogonyok rehabilitation center of pediatric orthopedics and traumatology . the extent of deformation during and after the treatment is in accordance with the v. d. chaklin x - ray grading system accepted in russia . according to this system , grade i represents scoliotic deformation from 1 to 10 by cobb , grade ii from 11 to 25 , grade iii from 26 to 50 , and grade iv > 50.  
according to the pattern of deformation progress , patients were assigned to nonprogressive , progressive , and rapidly progressive ais forms .
patients with radiologically detected spinal deformation increase during a previous year of 5 by cobb were defined as nonprogressive forms , patients with an annual deformation > 5  10 were defined as progressive , and patients with annual deformation 10 by cobb were defined as rapidly progressive ais forms  see table 1 .
eegs were recorded on a mitsar 21eeg electroencephalography system ( russia ) simultaneously and unipolarly from 21 channels according to the international 1020 system relative to a shorted reference earlobe electrode .
eeg recording was performed on all subjects at the same time ( from 11 am to 1 pm ) in a state of quiet wakefulness with closed eyes .
the recording areas of 80  sec duration without artifacts were used for further processing .
it is known that sudden light exposure during one of the  dark  periods blocks melatonin secretion ; however , there was no reaction during conventional daylight periods when light was suddenly switched off .
that is why eeg from recording subjects with closed eyes in quiet wakefulness during daytime is methodically reasonable .  
this software calculates equivalent dipole source coordinates ( hereafter referred to simply as dipoles ) from eegs .
the algorithm is based on solving a reverse electroencephalography task and is limited to a mathematical procedure of detecting sources of electrical activity , which are located in a three - dimensional brain space , from integral scalp - recorded potentials ( eeg ) . lately , a method of three - dimensional localization of eeg dipole sources is being successfully used in both applied and fundamental researches [ 20 , 21 ] .   in the 3dloceeg program , a model of a mobile equivalent electric dipole in an isotropic space
an algorithm for minimizing the non - dipole component in the multipole decomposition of potentials is implemented .
this algorithm was proposed to solve the task of three - dimensional localization of dipole sources in electrocardiograms .   in analysing each of digitized eeg ,
the program calculates the coordinates of an equivalent electric dipole according to the algorithm specified .
the path of the point with the derived coordinates is imaged and superimposed on anatomical brain structures according to the atlas by mai et al . .
in this atlas , a system of intracerebral coordinates by talairach and tournoux is used .   in our case ,
the points are reflected on brain sections ( sagittal , horizontal , and frontal ) of 1  cm thickness ( a total of 36 sections ) .
sections are scaled up by individual patient 's skull sizes according to recommendations . for this , measurements of the distance between skull reference points ( inion - nasion , between external ear canals , etc . ) and the distance between electrodes ( a total of 32 measurements ) are required . by means of such data , three - dimensional coordinates of recording electrodes are determined and are then used for approximation of the skull surface .  
we used a program with a digitizing frequency of 250  hz , thus obtaining a new point with coordinates of a moving dipole every 4  msec .
when all dipole coordinates along with their  powers  ( values proportional to a dipole moment vector length ) are known , points with maximal power are found on a previously chosen temporal eeg segment .
points with minimal power are removed from sections by varying the observed / highest threshold ratio ; generally ( but not always ) , these are the noise points due to the impossibility of entirely eliminating artifacts of various kinds during eeg recording . only dipoles with coordinates within the pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) were analyzed .
the number of dipoles in these areas was standardized relative to a total number of recorded dipoles .
it is important to note that pineal gland neurons ( pinealocytes ) together with the capability to secrete peptide hormones ( neuropeptides ) specific to endocrine cells maintain their neuron organization and function , that is , are able to generate and disseminate nerve pulses .
the data were processed in statistica ( statsoft v. 6.1 ) using mann - whitney  u - test for independent samples .
the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the ogonyok rehabilitation center of pediatric orthopedics and traumatology .
to study age - specific changes in bioelectric activity ( ba ) of the pineal gland , eegs from children aged from 8 to 16 years were analyzed in groups of healthy subjects and in patients with ais .
dipole amounts in the pineal gland area ( % of total recorded dipoles ) averaged by different ages in healthy children , and children with ais are presented in figure 1 as m  1.96 sd .   statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 by mann - witney test ) between patients with ais and healthy peers are found in age groups of 1014 years ( i.e. , in the pubertal period ) . in general , dipole numbers in the pineal gland area were lower in healthy subjects than in ais patients , even in those age groups where these differences were statistically not significant .
adolescent girls strongly predominated among children with ais , and their typical pubertal age was from 10 to 14 years ; thus , eegs of girls of this age were selected for analysis of ba activity in the pineal and scn areas .
the distribution in the number of dipoles ( as % of total number of recorded dipoles ) in the pineal gland area in patients with different ais severity and healthy subjects is presented in figure 2 .
the figure shows that the lowest activity in the pineal gland was recorded in healthy subjects . in patients with ais
the number progressively increased with worsening of the condition , achieved maximal values in patients with grade iii severity , and slightly decreased in patients with grade iv . among female patients with grade iv ,
girls aged 14 years predominated ( 57% of cases ) ; in this age group , the growth process and consequently the progress of deformation already slow down .
instead , the total number of dipole sources in the right and left scn areas was inversely proportional ( figure 3)the greatest activity in the scn area was noted in healthy subjects .
it gradually decreased with ais progress the worsening of the clinical condition worsening and again slightly increased in patients with grade iii and iv ais .  
differences in dipole quantities between healthy subjects and patients with different grades of ais severity are not statistically significant and in this case one can speak of an observed trend only .
the most likely reason for the lack of significant differences is a limited resolution of the method used and significantly smaller scn sizes compared to the size of the pineal gland .
thus , considerably more dipoles reflecting activity of adjacent brain structures were registered in the scn compared to the pineal area .  
the ratio of scn / pineal dipole quantity , in our opinion , may be an integral bioelectric characteristic of the relationship in the  pineal gland 
research of the pineal gland  scn system functioning in ais patients not only with varied spine deformation severity but also with varied progressive activity deserves special attention .
bioelectric processes in central nervous system ( cns ) reflecting abnormalities in the normal pubertal period often stop by the time of radiological documentation of spinal curvature . in many cases ,
eegs of patients with grade iv ais and marked spinal deformation hardly differ from those of healthy peers .   in figure 5 ,
ratios of scn to pineal gland dipole numbers are provided in groups of healthy subjects and patients with various progression patterns .
as it is evident from the figure , this parameter decreased from healthy patients to patients with nonprogressive ais and achieved statistically significant differences between healthy children and patients with progressive and rapidly progressive forms .
in healthy children , blood melatonin concentration increases gradually up to one year and is maintained on a relatively high level up to the pubertal period .
the major role of melatonin in this age period is to prolong the sleeping period and to suppress sex hormone secretion . in puberty ,
the amount of circulating melatonin decreases ; moreover , this decrease is more prominent when sexual maturity ( pubertal period ) begins .
our results on age - specific dipole distribution in the pineal gland area of healthy subjects confirm the established fact of an age - related decrease in pineal gland activity [ 26 , 27 ] ; hence , our chosen research method is appropriate . besides the pubertal period coincides with a period of the most rapid progress of spinal deformation in children with ais . in this period , an amount of serum melatonin decreases by 4 times .  
the triggering of the pubertal phase is considered to be a result of concordance of two physiological processes in the hypothalamus : luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ( gonadotropin - releasing hormone ) production by the arcuate nucleus and activity of the scn as a circadian rhythm regulator .
slowed frequency of scn oscillations leads to increased stimulation of gonadotropin - releasing hormone secretion . as a result ,
gonadotropin hormones ( gths ) are episodically released during the early pubertal period , particularly luteinizing and follicle - stimulating hormones during nighttime .
then , rhythmic gth secretion is achieved which stimulates synthesis and secretion of sex hormones by gonads , along with gametogenesis . in experiments on animals
it was established that reproductive function is regulated not by the immediate influence of the pineal gland on sex glands but by the modulation of hypothalamic - hypophysis system activity ( preoptic area of the hypothalamus and the tuberal part of the hypophysis ) . inhibiting influence of the pineal gland on sexual functions
is mediated by some factors : melatonin reduces or inhibits secretion of gonadotropin - releasing hormone by the hypothalamus and secretion of gonadotropins by the anterior lobe of the hypophysis . at the same time
, pinealocytes produce the antigonadotropin hormone that reduces secretion of luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone by the anterior lobe of the hypophysis .  
it may be supposed that differences in the functioning of this system according to electrophysiology ba tests in the scn and pineal areas between healthy subjects and patients with ais are bioelectric reflections of their own and of downstream functional disorders .
one of these disorders apparently leads to delayed sexual maturity in girls with ais , which was demonstrated in some anatomic and physiologic studies .   however , this retardation is quite small , within 0.51 year .
clinically relevant retardation of sexual maturity is determined ( by tanner ) as delay of sexual maturity signs by more than 2 years from an appropriate mean population age .
thus , deviations in sexual maturity mechanisms in ais are much more delicate than those considered in clinical endocrinology in cases of quite severe disorders of sexual development .
it should be noted that there is no generally accepted opinion on delayed sexual development in girls with ais .
some authors , on the contrary , report an accelerated sexual development in girls with ais . however , quite mild delay of sexual maturity by itself does not explain scoliotic deformation in children with ais .
the possible reasons for explaining the development of spinal deformation in children may be obtained in considering this issue from a position of chronobiology .  
the pineal gland / scn system is the main synchronizer of biologic rhythms of the body , effecting their coordination .
defects in the activity of this system ( abnormal melatonin production and/or shift of its secretion phase ) result in desynchronization of body biorhythms and the development of various pathologies .
an inverse pineal gland relationship with scn plays a major role here , as its disturbance changes periods of internal pacemaker activity , thus leading to desynchronization and impairment of related body processes . in the case of pineal gland / scn system dysfunction , disorders of the hypothalamopituitary - adrenal axis
are observed , particularly in the secretion of cortisol and other mineral corticoids , and the osteoblast function [ 3032 ] .
this results in multiple disruptions of various functional body systems . in vertebrate animals , somatotropic hormone ( sth ) , or growth hormone , of the anterior lobe of the hypophysis
is the main regulator of protein synthesis , which also affects mineral , carbohydrate , and lipid metabolism .
although these hormone effects on tissues are mediated by somatomedins , there is a specific relationship between growth rhythms and periodic changes in sth secretion and inflow into tissues .
sth secretion coincides with slow - wave sleep and mainly takes place during the first half of the night , that is , sth secretion is also affected by the scn / pineal gland system [ 25 , 30 ] .   during the years
19601980 it was shown that changes in illumination patterns resulting in abnormal scn / pineal gland system activity led to marked osteosynthesis disturbance , up to stopping bone tissue growth [ 33 , 34 ] . in one of the recent works   dedicated to ais aetiology and pathogenesis it was also shown that changes in illumination patterns led to scoliosis development in 15% of chickens with an intact pineal gland . however , in this case serum melatonin decreases almost down to zero , as opposed to children with ais .   if pineal gland ba is considered as the bioelectric reflection of its secretory activity , then our data on increased pineal gland ba in children with ais compared to healthy peers are in conflict with those obtained in experiments with pinealectomized animals ; some clinical trials suggesting decreased serum melatonin in cases of development of spinal scoliosis . on the other hand ,
our data support the data of most clinical works suggesting the normal ( more frequently ) or even increased levels of melatonin in patients with ais .   in our opinion , the reason for ais development is probably not decreased ( or increased ) serum melatonin ( which appears to take place in some cases as well ) , but a disrupted rhythm of its secretion .
this leads to discrepancy between delicate by related mechanisms of hormone excretion and hormone sensitivity of body tissues .
it is known that maximal and minimal hormone concentrations differ more than 10-fold over a 24-hour period . therefore ,
along with hormone concentrations , the temporal coincidence of hormone secretion and maximal reactivity of body tissues ( in this case , bone tissue ) to their exposure is extremely important .
it was demonstrated that in some diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , depressions , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's diseases , immunodeficiency , and cancers , the pineal gland synthesizes less melatonin or , more importantly , disorders of melatonin secretion rhythm occur , while the total amount of synthesized melatonin is maintained .
however , virtually all clinical studies of pineal gland / scn system in ais patients assess mean daily / nightly concentrations of serum melatonin and its urine metabolites ; occasionally , few discrete samples are taken .
these methods may not be capable of assessing delicate mechanisms of temporal disorders in scn / pineal gland activity .  
dysfunction of pineal gland activity ( with scn as a pacemaker ) leads to a discrepancy between related mechanisms of excretion and reception of different hormones ( including osteotropic hormones , sth , cortisol ) which results in the development of scoliosis on a pinealectomized chicken model .
moreover , the total melatonin concentration may not decrease during ais development , imbalanced scn / pineal gland activities are a sufficient cause .
this latter statement may be confirmed by evidence that disruption of pineal conduction paths integrity is enough for scoliosis development on a pinealectomized chicken model , even if pineal anatomy and secretory function are preserved .
this surgery is even more effective for experimental scoliosis development than a total pineal gland extirpation .
ais may therefore be referred to the so - called desynchronoses  pathologic conditions associated with biorhythm disorders .  
scn / pineal gland system dysfunction may be caused by different pathologic factors affecting cns formation and development in prenatal and early postnatal periods .
they include , among others , hormone medications , stress and toxicosis during pregnancy , pathological birth , infections , intoxications , any chronic diseases , and craniocerebral injury .
as judged by medical histories of patients under study , pathogenic effects do not correlate with degree of severity .
this is probably due to individual limits of functional endurance established during a period of differentiation and development of hypothalamic structures ; these limits further characterize a subject 's hormonal system throughout his life .
changes in electric activity levels in the pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nucleus area revealed in our study suggest that dysfunctions in brain areas responsible for the formation and maintenance of normal biorhythm patterns , including osteogenesis and bone growth , are involved in ais aetiopathogenesis .
our results may be used for developing methods which are novel and essentially different from those currently used for the treatment of ais and for preventive measures that are primarily aimed at normalizing the biorhythms of the scn / pineal gland system .","1. Background

"the goal is to ensure that safety and morbidity are minimized regardless of the technique that is employed ( 1 ) .
it is the most frequently implemented surgical intervention in children , and one third of all the men in the world are circumcised .
the procedure may also be performed for medical reasons ( 2 ) . however , the issue of when to perform elective circumcision is still debated ( 3 , 4 ) .
circumcision is routinely performed in muslim and jewish cultures ; however muslims perform circumcision at age 6 , whereas jews perform it immediately after birth .
although a few minor surgical interventions can be performed under local anesthesia in childhood , sedation or general anesthesia are used for most surgical interventions ( 5 ) .
different anesthesia methods are applied for circumcision , depending on the age of the patient ( 6 ) .
the patient is sedated with midazolam , a combination of midazolam and ketamine , or general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask ( 5 , 7 , 8) .
this study was carried out to determine the best age range for performing routine male circumcision with respect to anesthetic approach , complications and costs .
this clinical trial was conducted at the affiliated hospital of erzincan university of medical sciences ( turkey ) between june and december 2014 .
the approval of the ethics council of the university and the informed consent of the parents of the children were obtained .
the children who had medical indications for circumcision , such as phimosis , balanitis , in addition to hypospadias anomaly and bleeding disorders were excluded .
the male children applying to our hospital for circumcision were divided into 3 groups based on age : group 1 consisted of children younger than 1 year , group 2 consisted of children ages 1 - 7 , and group 3 consisted of children older than 7 .
the patients were sedated to achieve a wilton sedation scale score equal to or higher than 3 ( sitting or lying comfortably , eyes - open , cooperative , not crying ) ( 9 ) .
midazolam 0.1 mg / kg and atropine 0.02 mg / kg iv were first administered . if adequate sedation was not achieved , 2
if adequate sedation was still not achieved , general anesthesia was given through a laryngeal mask ( 1% sevoflurane , 50% o , 0.2 mg / kg rocuronium bromide ) .
a penile block was provided with 3 mg / kg lidocaine hydrochloride diluted with a 1/1 physiologic saline solution . the average duration of surgery was 15 minutes .
after circumcision , the children with a modified aldrete recovery score  9 were transferred to the service ( 10 , 11 ) .
analgesia ( pudendal block ) and the surgery was performed by the same surgeon for all of the patients .
the anesthesia procedures , adequacy of sedation and anesthesia complications were assessed by the five anesthesiologists , but the surgical complications were evaluated by the surgeon .
the groups were compared regarding the duration of postanesthesia recovery , complications , time until discharge , and cost statistically .
continuous variables were shown as medians ( minumum - maximum ) and categorical data were presented as percentages .
the one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test was used to evaluate whether the distribution of continuous variables was normal .
data were analyzed using spss 17.0 version ( spss inc , chicago , illinois ) .
continuous variables were shown as medians ( minumum - maximum ) and categorical data were presented as percentages .
the one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test was used to evaluate whether the distribution of continuous variables was normal .
data were analyzed using spss 17.0 version ( spss inc , chicago , illinois ) .
there were 374 children in group 1 ( < 1 year ) , 94 children in group 2 ( 1 - 7 years old ) , and 135 children in group 3 ( > 7 years old ) . in group 1 ,
sedation was achieved with midazolam for 364 children ( 97.3% ) , and the addition of ketamine was required for 10 children ( 2.7% ) . in group 2 ,
sedation was achieved with midazolam alone in only 6 children ( 6.3% ) , ketamine was required for 64 children ( 80.8% ) , and general anesthesia was required for 12 children ( 12.8% ) . in group 3 ,
sedation was achieved with midazolam in 38 children ( 28.1% ) , the addition of ketamine was needed for 51 patients ( 38% ) , and general anesthesia was required by only 4 children ( 3% ) . for 42 children in group 3 ,
the groups were compared statistically in terms of cost ( $ ) , post - anesthesia recovery duration ( minutes ) , time until discharge ( hours ) , and complications ( table 4 ) .
the cost , post - anesthesia recovery duration , time until discharge , and anesthesia complications for group 1 were significantly lower than those for groups 2 or 3 , and those of group 3 were significantly lower compared with group 2 ( p < 0.001 ) .
no significant difference was found with respect to the surgical complications ( p > 0.05 ) .   
most of the debates about the best age at which to perform male circumcision focus on the following age groups : neonatal and infancy period , phallic stage ( age 3 - 4 ) and school age ( 2 , 12 , 13 ) .
although male circumcision is considered an ethical problem in the world , 30% of all men are circumcised . except for emergency cases ,
moreover , it has been reported to have socio - sexually positive aspects ( 14 ) .
the issue male circumcision that it is performed routinely some communities in the world what age should be done and which anesthesia methods should be used are discussed .
el bcheraoui stated that adverse events associated with male circumcision are reduced if the procedure is performed during the first year of life ( 15 ) .
therefore , appropriate anesthesia and postoperative analgesia is required ( 16 ) . when circumcision is performed in children older than 6 , as is customary for muslims , sevoflurane general anesthesia and penile block are typically used . for neonatal circumcision , which is implemented more frequently in jewish societies , local anesthetic pomades are administered .
it has been reported that the < 1 age circumcision increased the respiratory problems after the general anesthesia .
thus , the use of general anesthesia during circumcision should be reserved for patients who are older than 1 ( 6 ) .
the most important ethical issue to be discussed about circumcision is the analgesia and anesthesia .
which analgesia and anesthesia methods should be implemented in which age groups ( 17 ) ? a combination of midazolam and ketamine is frequently used as sedoanalgesia in children ( 5 , 18 ) . in our study ,
general anesthesia was not required for any of the subjects < 1 year old , and sedation was achieved with midazolam alone in 97% of these patients .
the rate of complications due to anesthesia was lower for patients who were sedated with midazolam than for those who received both midazolam and ketamine .
the highest rate of complications due to anesthesia was observed in children who received general anesthesia .
this may explain why group 1 , which did not include any patients who underwent general anesthesia , experienced significantly fewer complications related to anesthesia than group 2 , and group 3 experienced significantly less complications related to anesthesia than group 2 ( p < 0.001 ) .
the shortest post - anesthesia recovery period was observed in group 1 ( 1.1 minutes ) , and the longest period was observed in group 2 ( 7.2 minutes ) ( p < 0.001 ) . it has been reported in the literature that neonatal circumcision is less painful and is associated with fewer complications , but it requires more experience on the part of the surgeon . however , there are reports of increasing surgical complications associated with neonatal circumcision ( 19 - 21 ) .
the youngest child in our series was 1 month old , while the oldest patient was 14 years old ; thus , no neonatal circumcision was performed . with respect to surgical complications ,
no statistically significant difference was found among the groups ( p > 0.05 ) . for boys in the phallic period experiencing phimosis ,
topical steroid treatment is recommended as a nonsurgical alternative to circumcision to avoid castration anxiety ( 22 ) .
reported that circumcision in the phallic period does nt affect psychosexual functions ( 13 ) .
found that the risk of premature ejaculation is higher in children circumcised after age 7 ( 23 ) .
these findings suggest that it is better to perform circumcision when boys are < 1 year old , when the anesthesia complications are also at a minimum .
a longer hospitalization is associated with an increased risk of infection as well as increased costs ( 24 ) .
although the cost per circumcision in a comprehensive series in florida was $ 6.263 , it can reach as high as $ 15 in other countries ( 12 , 25 ) .
the cost of neonatal circumcision have been an average $ 38 in canada ( 26 ) . in our study ,
group 1 had the shortest mean time until discharge ( 1.00 hours ) , and group 2 had the longest time until discharge ( 3.00 hours ) .
similarly , the lowest cost was found in group 1 ( $ 13.01 ) , whereas the highest cost was found in group 2 ( $ 15.80 ) . with respect to the time until discharge and cost , group 1 was found to be lower than group 2 , and group 3 was found to be lower than group 2 ( p < 0.001 ) .
the surgeon s tools used in circumcision are the same for all age groups and thus do nt affect the cost . the main factor contributing to the cost is the anesthesia method used . the use of general anesthesia results in a longer hospital stay and higher costs than the use of sedative agents . in our study ,
sedation or anesthesia was not needed for some of the boys who were > 9 years old [ 42 children ( 31% ) ] .
the use of midazolam alone ensured the lowest complication rate , fastest post - anesthesia recovery time and shortest time to discharge .
midazolam by itself provided effective sedation in 97% of the children in group 1 , 6% of the children in group 2 , and 28% of the children in group 3 .  
one limitation of this study is that the youngest child in our series was 1 month old , while the oldest one was 14 years old .
this study would also have benefitted from having an equal number of patients in each group to provide a diffuse statistical distribution .
one of the strengths of this study was that it revealed that most people in turkish society want male circumcision to be performed when boys are under one year of age , as evidenced by the fact that 62% of the circumcisions in this series were performed on children less than 1 year old .   in conclusion ,
this can be accomplished with the use of midazolam for children younger than 1 year old .
compared with performing circumcision on older children , performing circumcision when a child is < 1 year old is associated with minimal anesthetic complications , a shorter time until discharge and lower cost . moreover , these young children are not at risk of being affected psychologically by the procedure .","1.

"the frequency of endoscopic surgeries based on laparoscopy or thoracoscopy has increased in recent years and the introduction of new surgical techniques has caused an increased occurrence of pneumothorax . during laparoscopic surgery ,
the use of carbon dioxide to secure the surgical space and visual field can cause such conditions as subcutaneous emphysema , pneumothorax , pneumomediastinum , pneumopericardium and gas embolism .
yet pneumothorax is rare and unexpected when performing laparoscopic surgery for the management of inguinal hernia .
we experienced a case of pneumothorax that occurred during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with hemodynamic instability .
a 56-year - old man with a weight of 65 kg and a height of 172 cm visited with a chief complaint of a 2-month - history of a mass in the left inguinal area .
the patient was diagnosed with a left inguinal hernia and then he was hospitalized for laparoscopic tep hernia repair .
normal findings were seen on the preoperative chest radiography , the ekg and the pulmonary function tests ( fig .
the patient was premedicated with midazolam 2 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly 30 minutes before anesthesia .
following arrival at the operation room , the blood pressure was 150/90 mmhg , the heart rate was 85 times / min and the peripheral o2 saturation was 98% . for the induction of anesthesia ,
thiopental sodium 300 mg and rocuronium 40 mg were given intravenously , and this was followed by tracheal intubation .
there were no problems during endotracheal intubation . following confirmation that there were no problems with ventilation in both lungs ,
a tube was fixed in the area that was 23 cm away from the incisor .
the anesthesia was maintained with o2 2.0 l / min , air 2.0 l / min , desflurane 4 - 6 vol% and remifentanil 0.3 - 0.5 g / min / kg . following the induction of anesthesia , mechanical ventilation was initiated at a tidal volume of 8 ml / kg and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths / min , which produced a peak airway pressure of 17 - 18 mmhg . at the start of surgery , the end - tidal co2 was 32 mmhg , the peripheral o2 saturation was 99 - 100% , the blood pressure was 110/70 mmhg and the heart rate was 85 times / min .
for the surgical procedure , with the use of a preperitoneal dissection balloon , a sufficient amount of space was secured between the posterior area of the transversus abdominus and the anterior area of the posterior rectus sheath and peritoneum . to secure the surgical vision in this extraperitoneal space , co2
after co2 insufflation , the peak inspiratory pressure and end - tidal co2 were 17 - 18 mmhg and 32 - 35 mmhg , respectively .
about 50 minutes after insufflation , the peripheral o2 saturation decreased from 100% to 96% .
the peak inspiratory airway pressure was 25 - 28 cmh2o and the end - tidal co2 was increased to 45 - 50 mmhg .
the blood pressure was 80/48 mmhg and the heart rate was 102 times / min .
after ephedrine 8 mg was administered , the blood pressure and heart rate increased to 110/55 mmhg and 110 times / min , respectively . at this time
, the arterial blood gas analysis showed a ph of 7.34 , a paco2 of 58 mmhg , a pao2 of 75 mmhg and a sao2 of 95% .
manual ventilation was performed at this time . when the breath sounds were auscultated , the left respiratory sounds were normal , but the right respiratory sounds were markedly decreased . under the suspicion that the endotracheal tube had migrated due to pneumoperitoneum or postural change , the tube was pulled out by 2 cm .
auscultation was done after manual ventilation was performed several times . yet the respiratory sounds were not improved in the right lung . there were almost no mucus materials during the aspiration with using an aspiration catheter . at the same time , the presence of subcutaneous emphysema was confirmed in the bilateral submental regions , the shoulder and the upper thoracic area .
but under the suspicion of pneumothorax in the right lung , a prompt resolution of the pneumoperitoneum was requested prior to further aggravating the condition of the patient .
the surgical procedure was completed 15 minutes after the request to halt the pneumoperitoneum . with the resolution of the pneumoperitoneum ,
the peak airway pressure decreased to 21 cmh2o and the end - tidal co2 decreased to 37 mmhg .
a chest ap x - ray was performed and this confirmed the occurrence of pneumothorax in the right lung ( fig .
the arterial blood gas analysis showed a ph of 7.34 , a paco2 of 44 mmhg , a pao2 of 389 mmhg and a sao2 of 99% .
this was followed by removing the endotracheal tube . except for the pain at the site of surgery , the patient did not complain of respiratory distress .
using an oxygen mask , oxygen 5 l / min was administered to the patient .
following the surgery , the disappearance of pneumothorax was confirmed on the chest x - ray that was performed again in a recovery room ( fig .
a chest x - ray on the third post - operative day showed no abnormal findings , and the chest tube was removed .
there is a trend that laparoscopic tep inguinal hernia repair is now being performed as an alternative to traditional open repair or laparoscopic transabominal preperitoneal hernia repair . in particular , laparoscopic tep hernia repair is a method that is favored for patients with recurrent or bilateral hernias .
the advantages of laparoscopic tep inguinal hernia repair include a low recurrence rate and a reduced risk of intraabdominal infection or contamination , and damage to the intra - abdominal organs and adhesion , as compared with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair or an open procedure . it also causes less postoperative pain and it enables patients to promptly return to their daily lives [ 2 - 4 ]
. there has been extensive discussion on the complications associated with the management of anesthesia during laparoscopic surgery .
pneumothorax is one of the serious complications , although it rarely occurs in association with laparoscopic surgery . yet in cases of laparoscopic tep hernia repair , surgical procedures such as the insufflation of co2 or the insertion of laparoscopic ports themselves are restricted to the extraperitoneal space .
however , its prevalence is likely to increase as the procedure continues to gain popularity .
a few cases in the anesthesia literature describes that laparoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repair having been complicated by pneumothorax without hemodynamic instability and/or subcutaneous emphysema [ 5 - 8 ] . in our case ,
the patient developed intraoperatively pneumothorax with hemodynamic instability . in cases of pneumothorax occurring during general anesthesia , such non - surgically related complications as barotrauma , damage to the bronchus during endotracheal intubation , rupture of congenital bulla or blebs , and side effects due to the insertion of a central venous catheter
a central venous catheter was not inserted and an excessive extent of positive pressure ventilation was not performed .
accordingly , the complications of this case were assumed to have occurred in association with the surgical procedure .
based on the findings that the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters improved when the insufflation of co2 gas was discontinued , the occurrence of pneumothorax due to a non - surgical cause could be ruled out . for the current case ,
the first was that co2 entered the retroperitoneal space and then it entered the pleural space and mediastinum along the tissue plane .
this might be consistent with the pathway for which the subcutaneous emphysema occurred in the neck and upper chest area in the current case .
chien et al .   reported on three patients who developed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and laryngopharyngeal areas .
a hypothesis for the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema is that co2 enters the retroperitoneal space through a myopectineal dissection and then it reaches the neck .
accordingly , it has been reported that setting the insufflation pressure of co2 below 10 mmhg and keeping the insufflation time below 2 hours are helpful for preventing pneumothorax .
shim et al .   reported that pneumothorax was occurred during retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy because insufflations pressures were over 15 mmhg . in the current case ,
the insufflation pressure was 12 mmhg and this corresponded to a slightly higher level than the recommendation .
but the insufflation time was approximately 70 minutes and this was not a long time .
the second possibility is the incidental penetration of the peritoneum . at the time of such a penetration
, co2 migrates due to congenital diaphragmatic defects such as a pleuroperitoneal canal or through the areas adjacent to the aorta or esophagus . in these cases
, injury can also occur to the urinary bladder or bowels during the surgery , and there is also a possibility for postoperative adhesion yet in the current case , the surgeons confirmed a lack of damage to the peritoneum during the surgery . in cases in which pneumothorax occurs during general anesthesia , such symptoms as respiratory distress or chest pain
the differential diagnosis should also be made to exclude other causes for the decreased oxygen saturation , which may delay the diagnosis of pneumothorax .
the treatment can vary depending on the causes and severity of the pneumothorax . accordingly , identifying the causes is essential for cases in which pneumothorax occurs during general anesthesia . as for the signs indicating a pneumothorax
, hypotension occurs due to the decreased venous return and cardiac output . in association with this , according to hurewitz et al . , although hypotension occurs in cases of severe tension pneumothorax , the cardiac output is maintained in most cases and this may maintain the blood pressure . according to barton , hypotension represents a substantial extent of the pneumothorax in cases of tension pneumothorax .
barton noted that early detection is essential prior to the occurrence of hypotension . in the current case , based on the findings that hypotension and tachycardia transiently occurred and mediastinal shift
was detected on the chest x - ray that was performed following the discontinuation of co2 insufflation , the possibility of the intraoperative occurrence of tension pneumothorax could not be ruled out .
the co2 insufflation should be reduced or halted in cases in which pneumothorax is suspected or confirmed during laparoscopic tep herniorrhaphy .
tube thoracostomy is not a mandatory procedure unless patients are hemodynamically unstable or their respiratory function is impaired because co2 is promptly diffused from the body . in most cases , the co2
is spontaneously lost within 30 - 60 minutes following the release of the gas . according to joris
maintaining the endotracheal intubation and elevating the positive end - expiratory pressure rather than a tube thoracostomy would be helpful for treating a pneumothorax that occurs during laparoscopic fundoplication . yet in the current case , due to the occurrence of mediastinal shift on the chest x - ray ,
the hypotension and the tachycardia , a tube thoracostomy was performed for the safe management of the patient , following consultation with the cardiothoracic surgeons .
as shown in the current case , when considering the possibility of airway obstruction due to pharyngeal emphysema , performing laryngoscopy prior to extubation would be helpful for cases in which subcutaneous emphysema occurs in the areas adjacent to the neck and face .
pneumothorax is a rare , unexpected complication during laparoscopic tep hernia repair , but there is a high possibility that the condition of a patient with pneumothorax can be aggravated and this may lead to death . to prevent this condition , clinicians should be interested in the pressure and time of the intraoperative insufflation of co2 .
anesthesiologists should closely monitor the alterations of the respiratory system such as the end - tidal co2 and the peak airway pressure and also the hemodynamic indicators to detect any signs suggesting complications related to laparoscopic surgery .","Introduction

"acute viral bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract disease in infants due to obstruction caused by inflammation of the tiny airways .
almost all the infants up to 2 years old have been infected by this disease .
evidences show that infection with respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is the cause of 50 to 80 thousand hospitalizations annually in children under one year old in the united states .
bronchiolitis is considered as 60 percent of all the cases of lower respiratory infections in the early childhood and during the first year of life   as well as 32 percent of hospitalized cases due to lower respiratory diseases in this age group .
a systemic review from several randomized clinical trials on the effectiveness of beta - agonists suggested that these medications have short - term and less effect on the recovery of this disease .
its treatment by epinephrine was first suggested in 1987 by wohl and chernick   and since then , many studies and review articles have been published on this treatment method [ 68 ] . in the study of bertrand
et al ( 2001 ) , in infants aged 1 to 12 months , mean duration of the hospitalization was 4.1 days in the epinephrine group and 5.2 days in the salbutamol group .
langley et al in 2005 , in a study on infants aged between 6 weeks to 2 years showed that the efficacy of epinephrine had been better than salbutamol and caused earlier discharge of the children from the hospital in the epinephrine group ; also other studies demonstrated that the efficacy of salbutamol and epinephrine was similar [ 1113 ] .
in other studies , the researchers announced that epinephrine led to earlier discharge of the patients from the hospital in comparison with salbutamol [ 1416 ] . in a meta - analysis study by hartling et al
, the researchers found that in short - term treatment , epinephrine is preferred to salbutamol , but still there were no sufficient evidences available to confirm this theory conclusively .
an appropriate treatment of this phenomenon can reduce the symptoms , hospitalization duration and exorbitant costs which is imposed on the families and insurance organizations .
several conducted studies so far failed to prove the preference of epinephrine to salbutamol in treatment of bronchiolitis .
therefore , this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of epinephrine in comparison with salbutamol on the treatment of the acute viral bronchiolitis .
this study was done on 40 children > 2 years old during winter 2008 to spring 2008 in isfahan , iran .
the target population included 1 month to 2 year old infants admitted to amin and al - zahra hospitals and diagnosed as acute bronchiolitis by the icu or ward physicians .
children with history of two or more respiratory distresses , wheezing , family history of asthma , those who suffered from chronic pulmonary heart disease , suspected heart disease , bronchomalacia , previous use of bronchodilator and glucocorticoids , those treated with monoamino oxydase inhibitors ( maoi ) , tachycardia > 180/min , and respiratory rate > 100/min,[4 , 1016 ] were not included in the study .
studied population was selected by nonrandomized simple sampling method and the children were placed in one of the two groups by the random allocation software .
the first group was given one dose of 0.1 ml / kg l - epinephrine in a concentration of 1.10000 and the other group received salbutamol 0.15 mg / kg at a minimum volume of 1 mg mixed with normal saline .
each volume was 3 cc , which was nebulized using oxygen flow 8 liters per minute .
three doses of each medication at intervals of 20 minutes were prescribed ; 10 minutes after the third dose , the patient was rated again by respiratory distress assessment instrument ( rdai ) , the most commonly used tool for severity assessment . during this medication ,
no other medications like antibiotics and steroids were prescribed for them . in infants with fever ,
the level of oxygen saturation was measured on admission and daily after each prescription through pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) .
vital signs were recorded completely at admission and daily , pulse rate ( pr ) and respiratory rate ( rr ) after each prescription and after the last prescription for 3 hours .
this variable was measured in all cases that were given medication for bronchiolitis , patients who received oxygen because of bronchiolitis or underwent intravenous fluid therapy .
this was a triple - blind study , i.e. the patient , physician and statistical analyst were unaware of the treatment .
in this study 40 patients , consisting of 20 ( 50% ) males and 20 ( 50% ) females , were studied .
the mean age of the patients was 387207.5 days ( range 52 - 710 days ) .
mean age of the patients in salbutamol group was 409.6207.6 days and in epinephrine group 364210.4 days ( p=0.5 ) .
mean and standard deviation of the patients ' weight was 9449.42767.3 ( range 4300 to 13650 ) gr . mean and standard deviation of the patients ' weight was 9871.22595.8 in patients receiving salbutamol and 9027.52933.7 in epinephrine group ( p=0.3 ) . regarding the association of used medication type and hospital stay , the mean and standard deviation of the patients ' hospitalization duration was 3.31.1 ;
this was 3.71.1 with median of 4 ( minimum 2 and maximum 4 ) in the patients receiving salbutamol and 30.9 with median of 3 ( minimum 2 and maximum 4 ) in epinephrine patients ( p=0.03 ) .
the mean and sd values of the obtained rdai from anova in repeated observations in the studied intervals in both groups are given in table 1 ( p=0.02 ) . 
 
mean ( standard deviation ) of rdai in the studied groups rdai : respiratory distress assessment instrument
the present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of nebulized epinephrine versus nebulized salbutamol in the treatment and successful discharge of acute bronchiolitis .
the outcome of this study showed that there was a significant difference between hospitalization duration of the patients receiving epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol .
in addition , there was a significant difference in assessing rdai index between the two groups of patients .
to agree with the results of the present study , previous reports have found that the efficacy of epinephrine had been better than salbutamol and resulted in short - term clinical improvement and earlier discharge of the children from the hospital [ 9 , 10 , 1416 ] .
also a meta - analysis study carried out by hartling and colleagues ( 2003 ) , established that short - term treatment with epinephrine is preferred to salbutamol , but still there were no sufficient evidences available to verify this theory conclusively . in contrast , in some studies the researchers demonstrated that the effectiveness of salbutamol and epinephrine was similar[1113 ] , which is not in accordance with the present study .
walsh et al ( 2008 ) also showed that in children up to the 18th month of life , emergency department treatment of bronchiolitis with nebulized racemic albuterol led to more successful discharges than nebulized epinephrine .
to our knowledge , the present study is the first study in iran that revealed the efficacy of nebulized epinephrine compared to nebulized salbutamol in the management of acute bronchiolitis .
it is possible that the improvement has been related to the -effect of the medication . as a limitation and problem of the current study we could state the low sample size which was caused by the time and budget limitations
considering that the studied researches in this regard could not confirm the preference of using epinephrine instead of salbutamol , further studies are needed with a larger sample size and more comprehensive level considering other relevant variables .
a large number of multi - centered trials therefore are recommended to observe the efficacy of epinephrine compared to salbutamol and to capture clinically significant outcomes in patients with bronchiolitis .
the obtained results of the present study in consistence with a number of other investigations , showed that using epinephrine instead of salbutamol , in 1 month to 2 year old infants with acute bronchiolitis , might be an effective step in improving the disease regarding its effect on the reduction of the hospitalization duration and the rdai index .","Introduction

"although obesity has stabilized in some us populations , it is still at epidemic proportions , with 31.7% of all children 219 years of age overweight or obese ( bmi  85th percentile ) .
anti - obesity efforts often fail [ 2 , 3 ] , and exactly why they fail is still unclear .
the discouraging results of many studies , including the largest , most rigorous antiobesity trials to be completed , suggest that interventions must be informed by an understanding of the multifactorial forces shaping obesity - related behaviors , including the social environment [ 36 ] .
social context influences both the routine practice of healthy behaviors and the establishment of norms .
methodologically , social support is measured from the respondent 's perspective to assess the support ( e.g. , emotional , cognitive , and tangible support ) an individual perceives to have , whereas social networks typically measure the presence or absence of friendships and task- or work - oriented relationships ( which may or may not provide support ) and treat the ties themselves as objects of study .
social networks , the complex webs of social relationships and social interactions that connect individuals , have been shown to influence behaviors , whereas social support is generally thought not to influence behavior , but rather is considered a mechanism to cope with challenges and facilitate recovery from illness , injury , or disease .
social network analysis allows us to see the whole group of individuals and their interconnectedness , identifying if new ties are established between people and what type of ties result .
weak ties ( e.g. , acquaintances ) can introduce new ideas into a network , whereas strong ties ( e.g. , close friendships ) can facilitate the dissemination of behaviors through a network .
diffusion studies show that people who are well integrated into a community ( have many ties ) generally adopt behaviors earlier than those who are less integrated ( have fewer ties ) [ 9 , 10 ] . although social networks exert measurable influence on our health [ 1121 ] , most of the work conducted focused on existing social networks . however , given that behavioral intervention trials often occur in a group context [ 2224 ] , measuring the development of new social networks and the ties that result is warranted .
once this question is answered , we can determine how to utilize this approach to potentially spread desired behaviors through new networks .
therefore , we set out to examine if families participating in a group - based obesity intervention form new social ties and , if so , what type of ties result .
consistent with the institute of medicine ( iom )   and the strategic plan for nih obesity research , we implemented a community - based , family - centered , culturally tailored obesity prevention randomized controlled trial ( rct ) .
the intervention was designed for latino families with preschool aged children and implemented in a public recreation center operated by parks and recreation in a neighborhood characterized by relatively high latino concentration and low socioeconomic status .
study inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) self - defined latino / a , ( 2 ) with a child aged 35 years , ( 3 ) valid phone number , and ( 4 ) planning on remaining in the city for 6 months . participants underwent a 30-minute oral consent process in spanish before providing written consent .
a total of 106 parent - child dyads were randomized , 92 had exposure to treatment and completed baseline data collection , 79 were retained and provided data at the end of the 3-month intervention period , resulting in an 86% retention rate for those who attended their first assigned session of the intervention or control conditions ( refer to figure 1 ) .
analysis of rq(1 ) included 79 cases ; analysis of rq(2 ) included 69 cases .
the culturally tailored salud con la familia program was designed to improve nutritional family habits , increase physical activity , and decrease screen time .
all sessions were conducted in spanish by the same trained facilitator . to ensure a sizeable treatment dosage , the intervention involved a series of 12 ( 90  min ) weekly group sessions .
the intervention was based on a best practice program developed by the national latino children 's institute ( nlci ) .
participants were randomly assigned to small groups ( of 68 parent - child dyads ) that met as a group throughout the study period . at each session , participants were assigned small group activities to practice the skills they needed to apply the information taught ( e.g. , how to choose appropriate portion sizes ; how to be active with children ; how to monitor screen time ) .
leadership roles were rotated through the group with the intention of increasing perceptions of group cohesion . to guard against differential drop out between intervention and control groups
, we offered a brief school readiness program as an alternative to the active intervention .
participants met in groups of 812 at 3 times for 60  minutes over the 12-week study period .
( comment and wait , ask questions and wait , and respond by adding more ) , an empirically tested curriculum which teaches parents to read picture books with their children .
the sessions were didactic and conducted in spanish by the same facilitator who conducted the intervention sessions .  
transportation and childcare for siblings were provided to all study participants to overcome the most frequently cited barriers to study participation .
participants received three small incentives after each wave of data collection ( e.g. , cutting board ) , totaling $ 60 per parent - child dyad .
a treatment fidelity plan was devised following the methodological practices suggested by the treatment fidelity workgroup of the nih behavior change consortium .
the plan included facilitator training ; identification of essential treatment components for verification ; sampling to ensure treatment consistency ; control for differences between interventionists ; use of fidelity measures ( e.g. , frequency of sessions ; participation rates ) .
a study team member observed 3 modules of each condition ( totaling 25 sessions ) and determined that 100% of the intended key messages were fully discussed , all planned activities had occurred , and intervention content was never delivered during control sessions or vice versa .
participants were randomized in equal proportion to each treatment group by using a computer generated permuted block randomization scheme , with blocks of size 10 .
a biostatistician generated the randomization list and placed the assignments into nontransparent envelopes , which were sealed and numbered consecutively .
after consent , participants received from the research coordinator the next numbered allocation envelope which was opened by the participant .
the treatment assignment and number listed on the envelope were recorded by the research coordinator and the participant .
all data were collected in spanish by trained data collectors at the community recreation center at baseline and at completion of the 3 month intervention .  
a social network survey was developed to assess change in social relationships over the course of the study period by capturing presence and absence of ties before and after the intervention .
respondents indicated the type of relationship they had with each other study participant ( e.g. , no relationship , friend , and acquaintance ) .
definitions for each type of relationship were provided in the instructions for consistent interpretation of these categories ( see the appendix ) .
the whole network was defined as all trial participants , so respondents evaluated their ties to all study participants not just the ones in their own study condition , in order to obtain complete data for analysis .  
body weight was measured , while wearing light clothing without shoes after voiding , to the nearest 0.1  kg on a calibrated digital scale ( detecto , webb city , mo , usa , model no .
body height without shoes was measured to the nearest 0.1  cm with the attached stadiometer .
bmi was calculated ( weight ( kg)/height ( m ) ) . because the amount of body fat varies for children by age and sex ,
the bmi z - score was computed using the calculator from the children 's hospital of philadelphia based on the cdc growth charts .  
acculturation was measured using the widely used and previously validated short - acculturation scale for hispanics ( sash ) , with internal reliability r = 0.81 in our sample .  
the sash asks respondents to indicate the language they read and speak , use at home , think in , and use among friends ( spanish only , spanish more than english , spanish and english equally , english more than spanish , and english only ) .
scores range from 1 to 5 ; a score < 2.99 indicates a low level of acculturation . to answer rq(1 )
we computed three ego - network - level measures ( degree centrality , constraint , and 2-step reach ) and one whole - network - level measure ( density ) of structure to determine if new relationships developed during the intervention period ( definitions of terms noted in table 1 ) .
t - tests were performed to compare intervention and control group using ucinet   and a bootstrap method in which observations are not assumed to be independent .
we created maps of each network in netdraw . to answer rq(2 ) , we used siena [ 4042 ] to test for underlying network tendencies in network dynamics and selection effects .
this provides the foundation for the assumption of a markov process in which each subsequent change in the network is dependent upon previous network conditions .
that is , newly formed network ties are dependent on the existing network structure , or as snijders et al .  
suggest  the total network structure is the social context that influences the probabilities of its own change  ( p. 6 ) .
finally , in this process it is assumed that actors have the possibility of forming new ties , maintaining ties , or dropping existing ties .
we treated bmi as a constant covariate and controlled for several commonly observed tendencies in network dynamics : outdegree , reciprocity , and transitivity ( definitions of terms noted in table 2 ) . in two separate models , we tested ( a ) whether parents tend to form ties with other parents who have a similar bmi , and ( b ) whether parents tend to form ties with other parents who have children with a similar bmi .
approximately 6 weeks passed between baseline data collection and the first intervention and control sessions , and in this time 14 randomized participants dropped from the study pool leaving a sample of 92 dyads exposed to intervention or control conditions ( figure 1 ) . as figure 1 shows , the attrition rate from initial exposure to 3-month followup was lower in the control group ( 15% ) than in the intervention group ( 36% ) .
there were no significant demographic or anthropometric differences at baseline between dyads who completed the 3-month follow - up data collection ( n = 75 ) and randomized participants who did not finish the study ( n = 27 ; results available upon request ) . among the 35 dyads in the intervention group for which we have 3-month data , the median number of sessions attended was 7 out of the 12 offered .
the majority of participating parents were mothers , first - generation mexican immigrants , with low levels of acculturation ( mean sash score 1.4 ) and education ( 25% of our sample had less than an 8th grade education ) .
eighty - one percent of participating parents were overweight / obese ( bmi  25  kg / m ) as well as 42% of children ( bmi percentile 85% ) .
the groups of dyads who completed the intervention and control conditions did not significantly differ on demographics or anthropometric measurements at baseline ( table 3 ) .
although given the option of indicating type of tie as friendship , acquaintance or transactional partner , no participant indicated acquaintance or transactional partner ties .
, there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in the four measures of network structure ( degree centrality , constraint , two - step reach , and density ) .
after the intervention , all network measures had changed in the predicted directions , in both intervention and control group , and all changes were significantly greater in the intervention group compared to the control group ( table 4 ) .  
the number of social ties people had with others in the network , averaged 1.5 at baseline . at study conclusion ,
intervention group members had developed more friendship ties compared to the control group ( 6.4 ties versus 3.9 ties ) .
the degree to which a person 's ties are with others who are connected to each other , declined at the end of the study period , in both groups , but significantly more so in the intervention group .
this means that intervention group members not only had more ties , but also those ties were less likely to be people who were already friends with each other . the proportion of people in the network that any individual could reach through their friends and the friends of their friends , increased in both groups but significantly more so for the intervention group . at the beginning of the intervention
, any person in the intervention group could have reached only 3% of the other group participants , whereas after the intervention they could have reached 32% of the other group members .  
although density more than doubled in the intervention group compared to the control group , at study completion the intervention group network was still a sparse network with fairly low density .
the jaccard index , which measures how much change ( related to ties created and ties dropped ) occurs between points of data collection , was  .256 .
although a jaccard index of  .3 is recommended for discerning structural equivalence sets , in this study the slightly lower jaccard index is considered acceptable given that the program brought together many mothers previously unknown to one another .
the model convergence was good as indicated by all t - ratio diagnostics being close to zero .
the negative parameter for outdegree was expected because most observed networks are sparse with densities well below  .50 .
this makes intuitive sense in terms of the limit on the number of ties that any one actor can maintain and the potential costs that might be incurred with the formation of new ties .
the positive reciprocity parameter indicates that over time if person a selects person b as a friend , then person b will select person a , or person a will drop his / her tie to person b. the significant positive transitive closure effect suggests that there is a tendency for a friend of a friend to become a friend .
the positive and significant effect for 3 cycles also suggests that there is a tendency toward localized closure but the positive parameter indicates that this tendency is not toward a hierarchical structure , but rather toward localized exchange and generalized reciprocity .
that is , the positive 3-cycle effect represents a pattern in which person a selects person b , person b selects person c , and person c selects person a. the presence of this pattern indicates that no single actor is privileged as being chosen above others .
the tendency toward closure suggested by the positive transitive ties and 3-cycle effects at first glance may seem at odds with the bivariate finding of decreased constraint noted above .
this finding can be reconciled in light of the significant increase in density of the network from pre- to post - test .
constraint is a relative measure based on the extent to which actors have transitive or intransitive ties . with the increase in the number of new ties in the network
, it would be reasonable to see an increase in transitivity even if the ratio of transitive to intransitive ties has changed .
one can see that the overall number of participants that are active in the network has increased ( in the pretest networks isolates are not depicted ) . on the periphery of both posttest networks
one can see that many participants only have one or two intransitive ties , contributing to decreased constraint . yet , at the same time , one can see an increased number of triangles in the posttest networks in comparison to the pretest network , indicating the tendency toward transitive closure .
the results suggest a tendency for parents to form new friendship ties with other parents whose child 's bmi z - score is similar to their own child 's bmi z - score , ( t = 2.08 , p < .05 ; table 5 ) .
there was no significant selection effect for maternal bmi in the formation of new social ties ; that is , overweight mothers were not more likely to select overweight mothers as friends ( p > .05 ) .
several research teams have empirically linked social network structures to adult and adolescent obesity [ 13 , 15 , 21 ] . to date , very little research elucidates the network context of obesity among children . while many obesity interventions occur in a group setting , underlying group structure and group processes are not documented in the scientific literature .
our research demonstrates that a new social network evolved among families participating in a pediatric obesity group - based prevention trial .
moreover , these new social ties formed in a predictable manner , with mothers forming friendship ties with other mothers ' who had children of similar body type .
social norms are thought to at least partially account for the clustering of health behaviors among social contacts [ 12 , 13 , 44 ] .
their findings suggest that social norms specific to one 's social network ( subjective norms ) influence weight more than broad societal level social norms ( injunctive norms ) .
subsequently , social network phenomena might explain some of the factors that underlie the misperception of body size and the social context in which they develop and are maintained .
parental misperceptions of child weight status are well documented , even among parents of preschool aged children [ 46 , 47 ] , and affect the likelihood that parents will take action to ameliorate their child 's weight problem .
we did not find overweight mothers to be more likely to select other overweight mothers as friends .
our null result is likely due to the low variability in our sample ( more than 90% of participating mothers were obese ) and small sample size for detecting selection effects .
others have clearly shown that adult and adolescent friendships cluster on the basis of weight status [ 6 , 13 , 15 , 45 ] .
there is evidence that social networks can spread positive health behaviors , such as smoking cessation , contraception use , and reduced drug and alcohol use [ 12 , 1517 , 44 ] .
such findings raise the question of whether social networks  either existing or newly constructed  might also spread obesity - protecting behaviors , such as physical activity , consumption of fruits and vegetables , or sleep hygiene .
this research lays the groundwork for understanding that new social networks can be formed in group - level interventions .
prudent next steps would be to examine the extent to which novel interventions could build new social networks to intentionally spread health behaviors . to explore such effects , future health studies should include social network data .
this study is a necessary first step in using social network analysis to strengthen group - based behavioral interventions that can be utilized in trials that aim to prevent or treat obesity .
given that many obesity prevention and early intervention behavioral trials utilize group settings , understanding new network formation could influence future trial design and implementation .
future group - based interventions might leverage the observed selection effect ( mothers forming friendships based on child bmi ) to intentionally increase group cohesion which , under favorable network conditions , may accelerate the uptake of prohealth knowledge , attitudes , and behavior across the whole network . alternatively , the observed selection effect might make it harder to intervene in individual behavior , in which case it would be prudent to counter the network effect by assigning parent - child dyads of varying bmi categories to work in groups together so that a high bmi is not seen as normative .
building on these findings and computer simulations of large social networks conducted by bahr et al . , allowing parents to self - select partners in small group activities will likely lead them to cluster in social groups according to child bmi , and if unrestrained , current social forces will likely drive their children toward increasing obesity .
it is also possible that just making parents aware of the tendency for mothers to selectively befriend mothers whose children have similar bmis might be a useful way to correct body size and adiposity perceptions .
social ties in the control condition increased despite limited social interaction during the study period .
this could reflect the fact that our study population , with low acculturation , feels socially isolated and yearns for connections with other latinos in the same stage of life .
one of the strengths of this study is the inclusion of rigorous network control variables in the modeling to rule out alternative explanations of our findings .
the analysis can not , however , rule out the effects of other individual differences in propensity to connect with others .
we do not know if the new social ties were strong enough to withstand the test of time .
the evaluation of whether newly constructed social networks influenced health behaviors ( i.e. , physical activity ) was untestable due to missing data .
the analysis of whether newly constructed social networks influenced health outcomes ( i.e. , bmi ) yielded nonsignificant results . these questions can be examined with additional waves of data collection and larger samples with complete data . only friendship ties were reported ( no acquaintance or transactional partner ties ) .
it is unclear if this finding is indicative of the strength of the groups or an artifact of how the question was asked .
we did not collect any process measures of role rotation during the intervention sessions , or a measure of perceived group cohesion . as with most community studies
, we had attrition over the course of the intervention and note that this was greater in the intervention group than the control group .
this could have biased our findings , but that is unlikely given that the noncompleters had similar initial anthropometric data to the completers .
the present study found that ( 1 ) a new social network can develop as a result of participating in an obesity prevention intervention in a group setting , and ( 2 ) study participants selectively form social ties based on their children 's weight status .
these findings should be taken into consideration as we develop pediatric obesity group - based intervention strategies that capitalize on the social environment .

"overall the prognosis in patients with differentiated thyroid cancers ( dtc ) is good . with appropriate treatment , the majority of these patients
get cured except in patients with metastasis where the prognosis is worse [ 2 , 3 ] .
management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer involves total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iremnant ablation ( rra ) , except in patients with intrathyroidal tumor  1  cm in size [ 4 , 5 ] .
the rra may also be avoided in low risk well - differentiated thyroid cancer with postsurgical stimulated thyroglobulin ( stg ) < 1  ng / ml , an approach not yet approved by american thyroid association ( ata ) [ 68 ] . the theoretical goals of adjuvant ablation are ( a ) to destroy any residual microscopic disease , ( b ) to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic whole body iodine scan ( wbis ) and specificity of serum thyroglobulin ( tg ) which facilitates follow - up and early detection of recurrence or metastatic disease , and ( c ) to use postablative wbis which is more sensitive than diagnostic wbis for detection of nodal or distant functioning metastases . according to ata guidelines , stg and neck ultrasound with or without diagnostic wbis should be done 612 months after rra in these patients to see the presence or absence of disease .
an area of ongoing controversy is the optimal dose of rai required to successfully ablate remnant tissue after total or near - total thyroidectomy with a single administration in low risk group .
this can be achieved by either dosimetry method introduced by benua et al . or by fixed empiric activity of rai .
, about 30,000 rad ( 300  gy ) radiation dose to thyroid bed was required for successful ablation and bal cs and padhy found 50  mci ( 1850  mbq ) of rai to deliver this required dose to thyroid bed after total thyroidectomy [ 11 , 12 ] . however , due to cumbersomeness of dosimetry method , the majority of treating physicians have adopted fixed empiric activity of rai ( 30200  mci or 11107400  mbq ) with no consensus about adequate ablative dose in low risk patients . due to these variable results ,
there has been lack of consensus among various thyroid organizations on the optimum rai dose for remnant ablation in low risk group .
the british thyroid association 's 2007 guidelines recommend the use of high dose rai . national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ; 2010 guidelines ) , the american thyroid association ( ata ; 2009 guidelines ) , and european thyroid cancer task force consensus report ( etctf ; consensus report , 2006 ) advise that clinicians can choose between the low dose and the high dose due to lack of reliable evidence from large randomized studies .
tg is a well - recognized marker in the follow - up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancers after thyroidectomy for persistent disease , distant metastasis , or disease recurrence [ 1517 ] .
stg before rra is a good predictor of successful ablation in these patients [ 15 , 18 ] .
its levels can be influenced by tumor staging and tsh levels as well as other factors .
therefore we did this study using tsh to correct the predictive value of stg in success of rra .
our objective was to see whether stg / tsh ratio can be used as a good predictor of successful rra and to compare its predictability with stg .

 patients . we retrospectively reviewed the medical record of all patients with dtc treated at the section of endocrinology ,
an approval was obtained from ethical review committee of aga khan university hospital for this study .
our inclusion criteria were as followed : ( 1 ) all adult patients with dtc ; ( 2 ) those who underwent total thyroidectomy ; ( 3 ) those having stimulated tsh ( stsh ) , stg , and anti - tg antibodies ( anti - tg ) 3 - 4 weeks after thyroidectomy without thyroxine replacement ; ( 4 ) those who received rra ; ( 5)those having posttherapeutic wbis ; ( 6 ) those having neck ultrasound , diagnostic wbis , and stg ; and ( 7 ) anti - tg at 612 months after rra .
we excluded patients with ( 1 ) less then total thyroidectomy , that is , subtotal thyroidectomy or lobectomy ; ( 2 ) diagnostic wbis done before rra because of possible stunning effect and low sensitivity ; ( 3 ) anti - tg > 40  iu / ml prior to rra as it might influence the absolute value of stg .
all 75 patients were treated as per following protocol : ( 1 ) they underwent total thyroidectomy ; ( 2 ) they were without thyroxine replacement for 3 - 4 weeks following surgery ; ( 3 ) they were on low iodine diet for 2 weeks prior to rra ; ( 4 ) they got their stsh , stg , and anti - tg done approximately 2 - 3 days prior to rra ; ( 5 ) they received rra of 30 to 100  mci in ata low risk , 150  mci in ata intermediate risk , and 200  mci in ata high risk groups ; ( 6 ) they got their posttherapeutic wbis done 3 to 5 days after rra ; ( 7 ) they were started on thyroxine after rra to suppress tsh below 0.1 in intermediate and high risk group and below 0.5 in low risk group ; and ( 8) they get their stsh , stg , anti - tg , neck ultrasound , and diagnostic wbis 612 months after rra .
diagnostic wbis was performed 48 hours after giving 2  mci of i. we used dual head digital gamma camera ( ecam , siemens , germany ) for both posttherapeutic and diagnostic wbis .
we assessed the following variables as a possible predictor of successful ablation : stg before rra , stg / tsh ratio before rra , age , sex , rra dose , postablative wbis findings , tnm staging , and histology ( follicular or papillary ) .
successful ablation is defined as stg < 2  ng / ml with negative anti - tg antibodies , no evidence of tumor on diagnostic wbis as well as on neck ultrasound 612 months after rra . tsh was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.008  uiu / ml , functional sensitivity of 0.008  uiu / ml , and reportable range of 0.008 to 150  uiu / ml .
tg was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.2  ng / ml and functional sensitivity of 0.9  ng / ml interassay for values higher than 2  ng / ml . anti - tg antibodies were measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 2.2  iu / ml , interassay precision of 4.65.8% , and intra - assay precision of 3.24.9% with reportable range of 203000  iu / ml and normal range < 40  iu / ml .
comparative analysis was done using student 's t - test or wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and chi - square test for categorical variables .
cutoff values of serum preablation stg and stg / tsh were determined and receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves were generated using roc analysis .
univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to see the predictors of successful ablation . for the analysis p value
records of 75 patients who fulfilled our criteria were retrieved . out of these 60% ( 45 ) had successful ablation , while 40% ( 30 ) had unsuccessful ablation .
there was no significant difference between two groups , that is , patients with successful ablation and unsuccessful ablation with respect to age and gender .
most of the tumors were papillary carcinomas 91.9% and 90% in successful and unsuccessful groups , respectively .
similarly no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in size of tumor , capsular invasion , pathological and tnm tumor stages , lymph node involvement , ata risk , and the dose of radioactive iodine given .
however more distant metastasis was seen in unsuccessful group as compared to successful group and this difference was statistically significant .
there was also significant difference in lower median levels of stg and stg / tsh ratio in patients with successful and unsuccessful ablation ; that is , lower median level of stg is 3.05 ( 0.2014.5 ) among patients with successful ablation , whereas it is 140 ( 17.65689 ) among patients with unsuccessful ablation . similarly lower median level of stg / tsh ratio is 0.067 ( 0.0050.26 ) among patients with successful ablation compared to 2.84 ( 0.36622.61 ) among unsuccessful ablation group .
76.6% of unsuccessful group patients had stg levels > 18  ng / ml as compared to 24.4% in successful group .
similarly more of unsuccessful group patients , that is , 80% of unsuccessful group patients , had stg / tsh ratio > 0.35 against 20.5% in successful group ( table 1 ) .
cutoff value for stg to predict successful and unsuccessful ablation was 18  ng / ml with 76.7% sensitivity and 79.1% specificity , while for stg / tsh cutoff was 0.35 with 81.4% sensitivity and 81.5% specificity .
roc curve for accuracy is illustrated in figure 1 , showing sensitivity and specificity for different cutoff values of stg and stg / tsh ratio ( figure 1 ) .
univariate logistic regression found no significant association of ablation outcome with age , gender , tumor size , capsular invasion , distant metastasis , and eta risk .
however lymph node involvement , stg levels > 18  ng / ml , and stg / tsh ratio > 0.35 were significantly associated with unsuccessful ablation ( table 3 ) .
similar trend persisted in multivariate analysis and only stg levels and stg / tsh ratio remained significantly associated with unsuccessful ablation .
association was stronger for stg / tsh ratio with aor 11.64 ( 2.4355.61 ) than for stg with aor 5.42 ( 1.1824.88 ) ( table 4 ) .
unsuccessful ablation may adversely affect the prognosis of patients with dtc ; therefore , identifying the factors that affect the success of ablation is very important in the management of patients with dtc .
thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein with molecular weight of 660,000 daltons containing > 3000 amino acids .
it is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum of thyroid follicular cells and stored in the golgi apparatus to be secreted in thyroid follicular lumen .
tsh stimulation leads to intracellular reuptake of thyroglobulin and its proteolytic degradation into active forms of thyroid hormones , that is , triiodothyronine and thyroxine .
initially tg was thought to exist in the thyroid gland only but in 1961 its presence was demonstrated in the peripheral circulation too as a byproduct of thyroid hormone synthesis . in healthy individuals ,
small amount of tg is released physiologically into the circulation but in dtc it is actively released into circulation . as tg
is actively released into circulation by dtc , therefore its level in circulation following total thyroidectomy is an established method of detecting recurrent or persistent disease particularly when performed after thyroxine withdrawal or recombinant tsh administration [ 2226 ] .
measurement of serum tg becomes an important parameter for residual or recurrent disease in the follow - up of patients with dtc following total thyroidectomy and rra [ 4 , 23 , 24 ] .
predicting the outcome of ablation in patients with dtc is important as this can help make appropriate decisions for patient 's management .
previous studies have focused on stg only as a laboratory parameter for predicting the ablation outcome [ 16 , 27 ] .
a recent retrospective study conducted on 133 patients revealed that a preablation stg < 8.55  ug / l predicted disease remission after 1824 months of rra with sensitivity of 88% , specificity of 72% , positive predictive value ( ppv ) of 47% , and negative predictive value ( npv ) of 95% .
another study conducted on 96 patients in brazil found that patients with stg levels < 18  ng / ml before rra had 5.89 times greater chance of successful ablation compared to those with stg > 18  ng / ml ( p < 0.0001 ) with sensitivity of 71.4% , specificity of 70.2% , ppv of 71.4% , and npv of 70.2% . another recent study conducted in china showed that in patients with dtc who underwent total thyroidectomy , stg and its ratio with tsh before rra might be considered as predictive markers for metastasis .
we used diagnostic wbis as an exclusion criterion due to its low impact on the decision to ablate and because of concerns over i induced stunning of normal thyroid remnants and distant metastases from thyroid cancer .
this is first attempt to assess the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome , which was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome than stg . in this study ,
factors such as age , gender , type of tumor , size of tumor , and capsular invasion were not found to be significantly associated with rra outcome , while stg levels are significantly associated , a finding which is consistent with other studies [ 1 , 2731 ] .
important finding of our study is association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome .
we found that stg / tsh ratio had stronger association with ablation outcome than stg .
as stg / tsh ratio was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome ; therefore , it can help us in predicting the success of rra and we hypothesized that it might also help in adjusting the dose of i. this adjustment in the dose of iremnant ablative dose might be very important particularly in low risk dtc where there is still no consensus on optimal dose .
cutoff value of 18  ng / ml for stg from our study is consistent with other studies from brazil , but our sensitivity and specificity are higher than those reported earlier for cutoff value of 18  ng / ml . since no cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio was available ; therefore , we also determined cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio , that is , 0.35 for predicting ablation outcome .
these cutoff values for stg and stg / tsh ratio in our study have high sensitivity and specificity in predicting the outcome .
this study is one of its kinds , investigating the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome in patients with dtc .
we found that patients with stg / tsh ratio < 0.35 before rra had 11.64 times greater chance of successful ablation compared to those with stg / tsh ratio > 0.35 with sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 81.4% ( p
. however limitation of our study was its retrospective nature ; therefore , we could retrieve data of only 75 patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria .
many of the previous studies regarding role of stg in predicting rra outcome were also retrospective in nature [ 8 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 29 , 31 ] .
another limitation of this study is use of different ablative doses in low , intermediate , and high risk groups which could have an impact on success of ablation as british thyroid association 2007 guidelines favor use of high dose for rra .
our data do not show a significant impact of dose of rra upon outcome and this is in concordance with two recently published prospective trials claiming no difference in outcomes in patients treated with 30 and 100  mci rra ( 32,33 ) . because of its smaller sample size , the result of this study should be interpreted cautiously and we recommend further studies not only to validate the cutoff levels that we have set but also to confirm the other findings of this study .
our study adds to the value of preablation stg and establishes the role of preablation stg / tsh ratio in predicting the ablation outcome .
one of the suggestions that came out from this study is that preablation stg / tsh ratio might be used for risk stratification , as till now there is no laboratory parameter in the risk stratification of the ata and eta for dtc before ablation .
so patients with stg / tsh ratio > 0.35 can be placed in ata and eta high risk categories as stg / tsh ratio has even more significant association with rra outcome than size and capsular invasion .
however considering the limited sample size in this study , further studies are warranted to confirm these findings .","1. Introduction

"in 2006 , the world health organization ( who ) reported that out of the 130 million live births every year , 4 million die within the first four weeks of life . of these deaths ,
99% occur in developing countries ( approximately half following difficult deliveries at home ) against 1% in developed countries .
most of these deaths ( 30 - 40% ) are due to neonatal infections . according to the 2004 demographic health survey in cameroon , neonatal infections are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths , thus constituting a major public health problem . in cameroon and in most developing countries , a combination of three parenteral antibiotics - ampicillin , aminoside and a third generation cephalosporin  which cover a broad spectrum of germs , is instituted to treat neonatal infections while awaiting culture and sensitivity tests . yet neonatal infections still claim the lives of many children in this setting .
this study was aimed at determining the incidence and risk factors of neonatal bacterial infections , the clinical and bacteriological profile and sensitivity to antibiotics used , and the clinical outcomes in a referral mother and child hospital .
the study was a prospective study in the neonatology unit of the yaounde gynaeco - obstetric and pediatric hospital , from the 18 november 2008 to 18 may 2009 .
the study population consisted of all symptomatic neonates ( 0 to 28 days ) with a maternal history suggestive of infection admitted in this unit within the study period .
patient selection was done in two phases : 
 phase 1 : all the neonates , in - borns or out - borns with at least one of the following anamnestic or clinical criteria as developed by the french national agency for accreditation and health . 
 
phase 1 : all the neonates , in - borns or out - borns with at least one of the following anamnestic or clinical criteria as developed by the french national agency for accreditation and health . 


anamnestic criteria : unexplained prematurity with gestational age 35 weeks , prolonged rupture of membranes ( 12 hours ) , stained or purulent amniotic fluid , untreated recurrent urogenital infections in the last trimester of pregnancy , maternal fever of 38c during labor , delivery at home , apparently healthy twin with other symptomatic . 

clinical criteria : fever ( temperature > 38c ) or hypothermia ( temperature < 35c ) , respiratory signs ( apnoea , respiratory distress ) , neurologic signs ( hypotonia , weak reflexes , perturbation of consciousness , convulsions , coma , irritability ) , digestive signs ( refusal to suck , vomiting , diarrhea ) , jaundice ( early [ < 24 hours after birth ] or prolonged ) ,

samples for complete blood count ( cbc ) , c - reactive protein ( crp ) , urine , blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) cultures were taken and sent to the laboratory .
samples for complete blood count ( cbc ) , c - reactive protein ( crp ) , urine , blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) cultures were taken and sent to the laboratory .
once samples were taken , the neonates were placed on triple antibiotherapy ( ampicillin , cefotaxime , and gentamycin ) . in those with positive cultures , antibiotherapy was re - adjusted according to sensitivity results .
after the results of the investigations were obtained , 218 neonates were retained in the study on the basis of the following criteria : symptomatic neonates in phase 1 , positive cultures , abnormalities in the cbc ( white blood cells > 25,000/mm or < 5,000/mm or platelets < 150,000/mm ) , raised crp ( > 6mg / l ) , or abnormal chest x - ray .
ethical clearance was obtained from the ethical committee of the hospital , and all the mothers provided informed consent before inclusion in the study .
urine cultures were done on mac conkey and cled culture media in an incubator at 37c for 18 to 24 hours .
identification was on api 20e ( analytical profile index 20 enterobacteria ) for enterobacteria ; api or typing for streptococci ; catalase , coagulase and dnase for staphylococci . for blood cultures
, samples were taken in the ward and put directly in the culture medium and incubated in the laboratory till bacterial growth for up to 10 days . in case of growth
a gram stain was done to orientate the diagnosis , and then inoculated in chapman 's culture medium or plain agar for staphylococcus , mc conkey or hektoen enteric agar for enterobacteria , and blood agar and chocolate agar for streptococcus .
cerebrospinal fluid was first inoculated in chocolate and blood agar and then incubated in carbon dioxide at 37c for 24 - 48 hours .
blood for cultures , cbc and crp was collected from the femoral vein ; urine by supra - pubic taps and lumbar taps all done by one of the investigators ( a.c . and m.d . ) .
sensitivity was done by diffusion with an equivalent bacterial suspension of 0.5 mc farland in mueller - hinton agar medium with 16 sensitivity discs of commonly used and locally available antibiotics (  lactamines , aminosides , sulfonamides and quinolones ) . for streptococcus , 5% of sheep blood was added to the mueller - hinton agar medium .
sensitivity was interpreted after 18 - 24 hours incubation at 37c with a caliper to measure the diameter of inhibition .
data was entered in epi info 2000 and analyzed with the statistical package for social sciences version 11.0 ( spss 11.0 ) software .

the chi - squared test was used to test for associations between risk factors and neonatal infection and secondly between risk factors and mortality .
we enrolled 115 ( 52.7% ) males and 103 ( 47.3% ) females giving a sex ratio of 1.11 .
approximately half ( 51.45% ) of the population were premature ( less than 37 weeks gestation ) and two - thirds ( 66.1% ) had low birth weights ( less than 2500 g ) .
neonatal infection was associated with low gestational age and low birth weight ( p=0.009 ) .
the incidence of neonatal infection was 34.7% out of the 628 neonates admitted within the study period .
of the 218 neonates , 197 ( 87.6% ) were received in the first 7 days of life and 27 ( 12.4% ) from 8 to 28 days of life , with 127 ( 56.3 ) inborn , 48 ( 22% ) from other health facilities and 43 ( 19.7% ) home deliveries .
there was no statistically significant difference of neonatal sepsis with respect to where the neonate came from .
of all the risk factors for neonatal sepsis , unexplained prematurity ( with gestational age < 35 weeks ) , and prolonged rupture of membranes ( prom ) ( 12 hours ) were the most frequent in 51 ( 23.4% ) and 46 ( 21.1% ) and a statistically significant p value of 0.02 and 0.04 respectively .

out of 437 samples ( 189 blood , 180 csf and 68 urine ) sent for cultures , a germ was isolated in only 42 samples ( 9.6% ) .
the germs cultured were klebsiella spp , escherichia coli , enterobacter spp , citrobacter spp , acinetobacter baumanii , proteus mirabilis , serratia fonticola , chryeomonas luteola , group a , b , and d streptococcus and non  group or b streptococcus ( table 4 ) .
klebsiella spp , escherichia coli and enterobacter spp were the most frequent germs isolated in respectively 28.6% , 21.4% and 14.3% of the neonates . 
 
germs cultured in the different samples csf : cerebrospinal fluid septicemia was the most frequent presentation in the early neonatal period with 23 ( 54.8% ) positive cultures , and urinary tract infection most frequent in the late neonatal period with 5 ( 12% ) positive cultures .
( table 4 ) we noted poor sensitivity of the germs to ampicillin ( 29.4% ) , gentamycin ( 18.9% ) and netilmicin ( 31.4% ) .
these are the first - line empiric antibiotics used for neonatal infection in this unit .
the best sensitivities were seen to imipenem ( 91.7% ) , ofloxacin ( 90% ) , ciprofloxacin ( 85.3% ) and ceftazidime ( 69.4% ) .

in this study , we noted an incidence of 34.7% indicating that this disorder is very frequent in neonates in the neonatology unit of our hospital .
similar high rates have also been observed in other developing countries notably 27.5% in abidjan and 73.9% in burkina faso , in contrast to the very low rates of neonatal infections seen in developed countries . in france ,
aujard and rambaud found an incidence of 1% for all neonatal infections [ 8 , 9 ] .
the variations in incidence between developing countries could be due to variations in the technical advancements of the health facilities , study designs and diagnostic criteria .
the low incidences in the developed countries reflect higher standards of the health care in these countries , with neonates less exposed to infections .
our results reflect those observed in morocco   and madagascar , but differ from those of shresta et al in nepal , who observed that behavioral ( 42.7% ) , thermal ( 41.7% ) and muco - cutaneous signs ( 41.7% ) were most frequent .
the most frequent risk factors found in our study are not different from those described by other authors .
we found that the most frequent risk factors for infection were unexplained prematurity with gestational age < 35 weeks and prom .
in other studies , the most frequent factors were foul - smelling vaginal discharge and prom , or prematurity and cervico - vaginal infections .
in developed countries especially in france , abnormal amniotic fluid and prom were most frequent . according to the french national agency for accreditation and health , prom , premature gestation and perinatal maternal fever above 38c are major factors in neonatal infection .
early - onset neonatal sepsis was by far the most frequent clinical presentation in 87.61% of the neonates , and is comparable to the rates from other african studies[16 , 17 ] and developing countries studies .
this finding could imply that contamination occurred before or during delivery therefore highlighting the importance of good antenatal and perinatal care in order to prevent neonatal infections .
the bacterial ecology was dominated by gram negative bacilli in both the early and late neonatal periods , although we had only 42 neonates with positive cultures . from all the germs
this high prevalence of gram negative bacteria compared to gram positive has also been found in many other studies in other developing countries [ 14 , 18 , 19 ] .
the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis in developing countries differ from those in developed countries .
overall , gram negative pathogens are more common and group streptococcus , is generally rare .
the small number of positive cultures reflects the difficulties neonatologists encounter when investigating babies with patent clinical signs and symptoms of neonatal infection in our setting .
this makes it difficult to know the exact bacterial profile in our units and should draw our attention to the urgent need for the knowledge on the spectrum of germs responsible for neonatal infection so that treatment can be initiated early in the absence of culture and sensitivity a major finding in our study was the resistance of germs especially enterobacteria to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin , gentamycin and netilmicin .
this resistance of isolated bacteria to commonly used antibiotics has also been observed in other developing countries[20 , 21 ] .
gangou et al , in yaounde , had a similar observation of low sensitivity ( 35% ) of klebsiella spp .
ciss et al in dakar , and hossein et al , in iran noted 100% resistance of klebsiella spp to ampicillin whereas there was a 33% resistance to gentamycin in dakar . who recommended in 1999 , and in 2002 , the empirical association of ampicillin and gentamycin despite the resistance of enterobacteria to these antibiotics and their high frequency as causative germs of neonatal sepsis in developing countries .
sensitivity of isolates was best with imipenems , ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin which are not frequently used and are considerably expensive in a low - resource setting .
however , the fact that these resistant germs were isolated in our study does not imply that they were the most common causes of neonatal infections since only less than 10% of the cultures gave a positive yield . concerning outcome , 48 ( 22% ) babies died , mostly within the few days of admission .
low birth weight , prematurity and septicemia were the most frequent risk factors for death . according to the who , low birth weight neonates have 20 times more risk of dying than those of normal weight .
aboussad et al in morrocco , observed that prematurity was a risk factor for death , whereas in france , prematurity was observed to be a criterion denoting severity of neonatal infection .
escherichia coli , klebsiella spp and enterobacter spp were the most frequent germs responsible for the deaths .
these findings are similar to those of cisse et al in the dakar university teaching hospital .
this study and others , demonstrate that the germs usually responsible for mortality are those which are most resistant to empirical treatment .
we think new guidelines need to be drawn , coupled with larger more recent bodies of evidence to combat neonatal infections and reduce neonatal death in settings with limited diagnostic resources .
strengths and limitations : this study is the first prospective study of its kind in this setting which is a mother and child referral hospital in the capital yaounde , the capital city of cameroon . the results obtained will serve as baseline data for future larger prospective studies . the fact that infection was confirmed bacteriologically in only 42 neonates is a major limitation of our study . some of the neonates had been through other health facilities where antibiotherapy was administered before being referred to the hospital , coupled with the fact that some parents could not pay for laboratory tests , and the small sample size .
this however emphasizes the need for up to date knowledge on the management of neonatal infections in the absence of laboratory confirmation especially in low resource settings .
we conclude that neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates in cameroon despite recent improvements in the health care system .
the emergence of resistant bacterial strains to commonly used antibiotics in this low resource setting is a serious problem .
we thus recommend the rational use of first line antibiotics in the management of neonatal sepsis with periodic evaluation of the bacterial ecology and sensitivity to antibiotics .","Introduction

"schiff bases represent an important class of organic compounds , especially in the medicinal and pharmaceutical field .
schiff bases appear to be important intermediates in a number of enzymatic reactions involving interaction of the amino group of an enzyme , usually that of a lysine residue , with a carbonyl group of the substrate .
schiff bases , derived mostly from variety of heterocyclic rings , were reported to possess a broad spectrum and a wide variety of biological activities including antimicrobial , anti - inflammatory , anticonvulsant , antitumor , and anti - hiv activities [ 24 ] .
it is evident that in azomethine derivatives the hc = n linkage is an essential structural requirement for biological activity .
the schiff bases have emerged as antimicrobial agents of an immense interest because of their broad spectrum of in - vitro activity and their in vivo chemotherapeutic activity . in addition , benzamide derivatives which are the possible metabolites of benzoxazoles show various types of biological properties such as anthelmintic , antihistaminic , antifungal , and antibacterial [ 57 ] .
the synthesis and characterization of new schiff bases related to benzamides with antibacterial and antioxidant agents are of great importance for their potential pharmacological use .
general investigation revealed that the components with antimicrobial activity have gained increasing importance due to growing worldwide concern about the increase in the rate of infection by pathogenic microbes .
this has rendered the current available antimicrobial agents insufficient to control microbial infections and created major public health problem [ 9 , 10 ] .
in addition , it is known that antifungal drugs do not have selective activity because of the biochemical similarity between human cell and fungi forms .
therefore , there are many studies focused on antibacterial and antifungal compounds [ 1113 ] .
free radicals and oxygen derivatives are constantly generated in vitro by a specific metabolic process .
these radicals can easily react with most biological molecules including proteins , lipids , lipoproteins , and dna
. these can be responsible for wide range of human conditions , such as arthritis , haemorrhagic shock , coronary artery diseases , cataract , cancer , aids , and age - related degenerative brain diseases .
proteins are the most abundant macromolecules in cells and are crucial to maintaining normal cell functions .
bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) , one of the major components in plasma protein , plays an important role in transporting and metabolizing of many endogenous and exogenous compounds in metabolism . in this work ,
bsa was chosen as a target protein molecule for studying the interaction because of its medically important , unusual ligand - binding properties , availability , and structural homology with human serum albumin ( hsa ) .
based on these findings , it was of interest to synthesize a new series of biologically active schiff bases related to substituted benzamides and evaluate their antimicrobial studies by disc diffusion method and antioxidant properties by dpph free radical scavenging and superoxide radical scavenging , with the hope to obtain more active and less toxic synthetic antimicrobial and antioxidant agents .
in addition , the interaction between the nabp and bsa has been investigated using fluorescence and uv - vis absorption spectroscopic methods .
all the chemicals and solvents were of ar grade . solvents were used as supplied by commercial sources without any further purification .
bsa ( essentially fatty - acid - free ) was purchased from sigma aldrich bangalore and stored in refrigerator at 4.0c .
bsa solution was prepared in the tris - hcl buffer solution ( 0.05  mol  l tris , 0.15  mol  l nacl , ph 7.4 ) and it was kept in the dark at 298  k. the compounds were prepared as stock solutions using dmf .
all other reagents were of analytical reagent grade , and double - distilled water was used during the experiment . elemental analysis ( c , h , n ) was determined using a carlo - erba 1160 elemental analyzer .
the h - nmr and c nmr spectra were recorded on a varian ac 400 spectrometer instrument in the indicated solvent using tms as the internal standard .
low - resolution esi - ms spectra were obtained on a varian 1200l model mass spectrometer ( solvent : ch3oh ) .
melting points were determined with a buchi 530 melting point apparatus in open capillaries and are uncorrected .
compound purity was checked by thin layer chromatographic method ( tlc ) on precoated silica gel plates ( merck , kieselgel 60 f254 , layer thickness 0.25  mm ) .
the fluorescence measurements were performed on a fluorophotometer ( varioskan flash 4.00.53 ) and the uv - vis absorption spectra were recorded with a uv - vis spectrophotometer ( systronics 118 , india ) .  
schiff base was synthesized by the condensation of p - aminoacetanilide with 2-benzofurancarboxaldehyde in 1  :  1 ratio . to a solution of p - aminoacetanilide
( 10  mmol 1.50  g ) in 20  ml ethanol required aldehyde , that is , benzofurancarboxaldehyde ( 10  mmol 1.46  g ) was added and the reaction mixture was then stirred and refluxed over night .
the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain 2.34  g ( 84% ) of yellow solid .

compounds 5a  j were prepared by the reaction of compound 3 ( 0.01  mol , 0.279  g ) with corresponding substituted acid chlorides ( 4a  f ) ( 0.01  mol ) , in ch2cl2 , and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20  h and the progress of the reaction was monitored on tlc .
the reaction mixture was diluted with ch2cl2 and washed with water ( 50  ml ) and brine solution ( 100  ml ) , and the combined organic portions were dried over anhydrous na2so4 .
the crude product was obtained after evaporation of the solvent and recrystallization from absolute ethanol gave desired compounds 5a  j .

the in vitro antimicrobial screening effects of the compounds ( 3 and 5a  j ) were individually tested against a panel of bacteria and fungi including staphylococcus aureus ( ncim 5021 ) , bacillus subtilis ( ncim 2999 ) , pseudomonas aeruginosa ( ncim 5029 ) , escherichia coli ( ncim 2574 ) , candida .
all the pure microbial strains were obtained from national chemical laboratory ( ncl ) , pune , india .
briefly , a suspension of tested bacterial strains was spread on the nutrient agar medium and potato dextrose agar for fungi .
the discs ( 6  mm in diameter ) impregnated with test chemicals each dissolved in concentration ( 100  g / ml in dmso ) were placed on the inoculated agar and these plates were kept at 4c for 2  h. the plate was incubated at 37c for 24  h in case of bacteria and 48  h at 28c in case of fungi .
streptomycin ( 10  g / disc ) and fluconazole ( 10  g / disc ) were used as the standards for antibacterial and antifungal activity , respectively .
all the samples were performed in triplicate and the zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters .
the compounds were dissolved and then diluted using dmso ; two - fold serial concentrations of the compounds were employed to determine the mic . in this method , the test concentrations of chemically synthesized compounds were made from 5 to 125  g / ml . the mic value was determined as the lowest concentration of the compound that completely inhibited macroscopic growth of microorganism . the capacity to scavenge the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( dpph )
the test samples ( 10100  l ) were mixed with 1  ml of dpph ( 0.1  mm ) solution and filled up with methanol to a final volume of 4  ml .
absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 517  nm in a visible spectrophotometer ( model 166 , systronics , india ) .
the free radical scavenging rate of the reaction solution was calculated as a percentage ( % ) of dpph decolouration using the equation 
 ( 1)i(%)=(ablankasampleablank)100 , 
 where ablank is the absorbance of the control reaction mixture excluding the test compounds , and asample is the absorbance of the test compounds .
radical scavenging potential was expressed as ic50 value , which represents the sample concentration at which 50% of the dpph radicals were scavenged .
tests were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean values  standard deviations .
superoxide radical scavenging activity was measured as described by kovala - demertzi et al . , ( 2004 ) .
the assay is based on the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium ( nbt ) by superoxide ions generated by the xanthine - xanthine oxidase system ( x  xo ) .
the reaction system contained 0.2  mm xanthine and 0.6  mm nbt in 0.1  m phosphate buffer , ph 7.8 .
the reaction was started by addition of xo ( 0.07  u  ml ) , an activity which allowed to yield the absorbance change between 0.03 and 0.04 per minute , at 560  nm .
the extent of nbt reduction was followed spectrophotometrically , by measuring the increase of the absorbance at 560  nm .
the ic50 of each compound was defined as the concentration which inhibited 50% of the nbt reduction by o2 produced in the x  xo system . for each of the four active compounds ( 5a , 5c , 5 g , 5h , 5i , and 5j ) ,
the binding parameters with bsa molecules were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy . a solution ( 2.5  ml ) containing 1.00
 10  mol  l bsa was titrated by successive additions of 1.00  10  mol  l nabp stock solution and the concentration of nabp varied from 0 to 3.0
fluorescence intensity was measured ( excitation at 280  nm and emission at 340  nm ) .
synthesis of the desired compound 3 was achieved by condensation of p - aminoacetanilide 1 with 2-benzofurancaroxaldehyde 2 according to the known method .
the second synthetic step involves the amidation of compound 3 with different substituted acid chlorides ( 4a  j ) in presence of triethylamine in dichloromethane giving rise to the respective aryl amide derivatives ( 5a  j ) .
the physical and chemical properties of all the synthesized compounds are given in table 1 .
the elemental analyses , h nmr , c nmr , and ftir spectra are fully consistent with the structure and the melting points are sharp , indicating the purity of the prepared schiff bases .   in the h nmr spectra , the chemical shift and multiplicity patterns correlated well with the proposed structures .
the formation of compound 3 was supported by the h nmr spectrum ( see supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/791591 ) by the appearance of a sharp singlet at 8.47  ppm , corresponding to the azomethine ( ch = n ) proton .
h nmr spectra of all synthesized compounds ( 5a  j ) showed  ch = n proton as singlet at 8.328.81  ppm . a comparison of h nmr spectra of compounds 5a  j with the 3 has shown disappearance of signal of nh ( 9.07  ppm ) proton on the formation of amide bond .
the signal due to oh in the compound 5j appeared as singlet at 10.02  ppm .
h nmr spectra of all compounds showed singlet at 2.202.25  ppm due to n - acetyl group ( n  co 
the absence of nh2 and c = o absorption bands in the ir spectra confirmed that the synthesized compounds were obtained via condensation .
the ir spectrum showed a characteristic strong absorption band at 1603 cm which is attributed to the stretching vibration of c = n bond formation in the synthesized compound 3 .
the ir spectra of 5a  j revealed the presence of c = o stretching band at 16501668  cm in all the analogues and 5j showed broad phenolic stretching at 3434 cm .
mass spectra of all newly synthesized compounds showed m+1 peak , in agreement with their molecular formula .  
in testing the antibacterial and antifungal activity of these compounds , more than one test organism was used to increase the chance of detecting antibiotic principles in tested materials .
the antimicrobial activity of the newly synthesized compounds ( 5a  j ) was evaluated against two gram - positive bacteria ( b. subtilis and s. aureus ) , two gram - negative bacteria ( e. coli and p. aeruginosa ) , and two fungi ( a. niger and a. flavus ) .
minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) of these compounds against bacteria and fungi was determined .
standard antibiotics , namely , streptomycin and standard antifungal drug fluconazole were used for comparison with antibacterial and antifungal activities shown by compounds ( table 2 ) .
the most potent antibacterial activity exhibited by compound 5 g ( mic 9.8  g / ml ) with three fluoro groups substituted ring in the respective series compared to the compounds bearing other electron - donating or -withdrawing groups . the compounds 5a and 5h possess active inhibition against all the tested strains ; this may be due to the fact that the presence of two fluoro groups in the compound is responsible for the enhancement of activity .
other compounds exhibit moderate to good antibacterial activity against all organisms . among these compounds ,
5b and 5f exhibit poor antibacterial activity against s. aureus , e. coli , and p. aeruginosa as compared to the standard drug .
the screening data of antifungal activity of these series of compounds shows wide range of antifungal activity .
similarly , compounds 5a , 5e , 5 g , and 5h exhibit good antifungal activity against candida albicans and aspergillus flavus compared to the standard drug fluconazole . in the whole series , compound 5 g with mic 10  g / ml shows the highest percentage of inhibition against both fungal strains and the compounds 5a and 5h pose difference in activity due to presence of fluoro group at different positions .
it is interesting to note that the electron - withdrawing property of the phenyl ring is important , which is corroborated by eminent activity of compounds with halogen group and decreased activity of compounds with either hydroxyl , methyl , or methoxy group in the phenyl ring ; hence the replacement of electron - donating group in place of halogens shows decrease in antimicrobial activity .
the researches of structure - activity relationship show that halogen atoms on phenyl ring enhanced the biological activity effectively .
it is because halogen could improve the affinity between compounds and special target of bacteria .
dpph radical scavenging activity evaluation is a standard assay in antioxidant activity studies and offers a rapid technique for screening the radical scavenging activity of specific compounds .
the free radical scavenging activity of newly synthesized compounds was tested by their ability to bleach the stable radical dpph .
the activity was monitored by following the absorption at 517  nm in a visible spectrophotometer . in the presence of any free radical scavenger ,
this odd electron pairs up and causes the diminishing of absorption band which is proportional to the number of electrons taken up .
a freshly prepared dpph solution exhibits a deep purple color with an absorption maximum at 517  nm . resulting from a color change from purple to yellow
the absorbance decreased when the antioxidant molecule can quench dpph free radical through donation of hydrogen atom or by electron donating to form a stable dpph molecule .
hence , more rapidly the absorbance decreases , the more potent the antioxidant activity of the compound becomes .
all the compounds ( 5a  j ) showed comparable or slightly less activity to the standard ascorbic acid .
the antioxidant activity was expressed as the 50% inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) based on the amount of compound required for a 50% decrease of the initial dpph radical concentration .
it was observed that the entire compounds notably reduced the concentration of dpph free radical .
the better activity of compound 5j ( ic50 15.3  0.11  g / ml ) , having hydroxyl group at p - position in the aromatic ring , has high electron - releasing properties and it activates aromatic ring .
the compound 5i ( ic50 18.5  0.17  g / ml ) , bearing an electron - donating methoxy group at para position , showed the better dpph radical scavenging activity compared to electron - withdrawing group substituted to phenyl ring . the compounds 5 g and 5h ( ic50 > 100  g / ml ) exhibit less activity than that of standard and 5j , due to the presence of electron - withdrawing group . observing the overall data for antioxidant activity ,
it is clear that compounds 5i and 5j were found to be the most effective antioxidants among all compounds .
superoxide anion radical is normally initially formed , and its effects can be magnified because it produces other kinds of free radicals and oxidizing agents .
the enzymatic superoxide anion radical was generated by the xanthine / xanthine oxidase reaction system .
the results ( table 3 ) revealed that all of the tested compounds exhibited superoxide activity with ic50 in the range of 11.6123  g / ml .
it should be noted that the activity of the compounds 5i and 5j was comparable to that of bha as observed from the ic50 values .
compounds 5i and 5j showed very good activity , since these compounds are having methoxy and hydroxyl groups at p - position in the ring , respectively . differently , in the m - position , methoxy and hydroxyl groups act as an electron - withdrawing properties , ( positive mesomeric effect is higher than negative inductive effect ) , which are possible for providing a destabilizing effect [ 28 , 29 ] .
fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the study of the reactivity of chemical and biological systems since it allows nonintrusive measurements of substances in low concentration under physiological conditions .
fluorescence quenching refers to any process which decreases the fluorescence intensity of a sample induced by a variety of molecular interactions with quencher molecule , including excited - state reactions , molecular rearrangements , energy transfer , ground - state complex formation , and collisional quenching processes .  
the fluorescence spectra of bsa in the presence of different concentrations of nabp are shown in figure 1 .
it is well known that bsa emits a strong fluorescence peaked at around 340  nm with excitation wavelength of 280  nm .
viewed from figure 1 , the presence of nabp led the emission intensity of bsa to decrease regularly , which indicated that the nabp can interact with bsa and quenches its intrinsic fluorescence .
a remarkable red shift of bsa fluorescence emission maximum wavelength is observed in 5c , 5j , and 5h .
red shift observed upon interaction of bsa with the compounds 5c , 5j , and 5h indicates that change in conformation of tryptophan environment in bsa .
furthermore , a slight blue shift of the maximum emission wavelength was observed for 5a , 5 g , and 5i .
the phenomena imply that the polarity around the tryptophan residue decreases with the increasing hydrophobicity after addition of 5a , 5 g , and 5i to bsa .   in order to investigate the quenching mechanism ,
the fluorescence quenching data k0 and n were analyzed by the stern - volmer equation ( 2 ) : 
 ( 2)f0f=1+ksv[q]=1+kq0[q ] , 
 where f0 and f denote the steady - state fluorescence intensities in the absence and in the presence of quencher , respectively , k0 is binding constant of bsa , [ q ] is the equilibrium concentration of the quencher , and n is the number of binding sites .
the average lifetime , 0 of the molecule without quencher is 10  s . the stern - volmer plots for the interaction of compound with bsa at temperature ( t = 298  k ) are shown in figure 2 . in all cases the plots are fairly linear . from figure 2 ,
the observed values of kq were larger than the maximum scattering collision quenching constant 2.0  10  l  mol  s , which suggests that the fluorescence quenching mechanism between nabp and bsa may be static rather than dynamic .   when the quenching mechanism is static , the binding parameters between bsa and compounds can be determined using ( 3 ) : 
 ( 3)log(f0f)f = log  ka+n  log[q ] .
the plot of log[(f0  f)/f ] versus log[nabp ] , binding constant ka , and binding sites n were calculated from the intercept and slope .
figure 2 shows the log[(f0  f)/f ] versus log[nabp ] and table 5 gives the corresponding calculated results .
the substitutions on the benzene ring could enhance the binding affinity of bsa and nabp .
as shown in table 5 , the binding constants of the interaction between them increased in the following order : 5j  <  5c  <  5h  <   5 g  < 
5a  <  5i . the two aspects that may result in binding potency are as follows : ( 1 ) the process of nabp - bsa binding is promoted strongly by the polarity of the substituent ;
( 2 ) the molecular size of nabp , the large - size molecule , may have larger hydrophobic area which can interact with hydrophobic surface on the protein molecule . in this work ,
the molecular size and polarity play a significant role in the binding between nabp and bsa .
the overlap of the uv absorption spectra of nabp with the fluorescence emission spectra of bsa is shown in figure 3 .  
the binding distance ( r ) between a protein residue ( donor ) and a bound drug molecule ( acceptor ) can be calculated from foster 's nonradiative energy transfer theory .
the efficiency of energy transfer e and the distance between the acceptor and donor r can be defined as the following equation : 
 ( 4)e=1(ff0)=r06r06+r6 , 
 where r is the distance between the acceptor and donor ; f and f0 are the fluorescence intensities of bsa in the presence of and in the absence of quencher , respectively ; r0 is the critical energy transfer distance when the transfer efficiency is 50% .
k 
  is a factor describing the spatial orientation factor related to the geometry of the donor and acceptor of dipoles ; n is the refractive index of medium ;  is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor ; j is the effect of spectra overlap between the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor and the uv - vis absorption spectrum of the acceptor , and j can be calculated by ( 6 ) : 
 ( 6)j = f()()4f() , 
 where f( ) is the corrected fluorescence intensity of the donor in the wavelength range from  to  +  and ( ) is the molar absorption coefficient of the acceptor at wavelength . in the present case , k = 2/3 , n = 1.311 , and  = 0.118 for bsa molecules , respectively . and
then , the values of j , e , r0 , and r were calculated and shown in table 6 .
the binding distance is shorter than 8  nm which indicates that the energy could transfer from bsa to nabp with high possibility .
in this work , we have presented the synthesis of novel benzamides related to schiff base in good yield and their spectroscopic characterization by means of different spectral studies and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities have been evaluated .
the antimicrobial evaluation data revealed that among the compounds studied , derivatives 5a , 5e , 5 g , and 5h have exhibited good antibacterial activity comparable to the standard streptomycin , while compounds 5a , 5 g , and 5h displayed better antifungal activity comparable to the standard fluconazole .
further , the compounds 5i and 5j displayed pronounced antioxidant activity as interpreted by the results of dpph and superoxide radical scavenging assays . the possible quenching mechanism of fluorescence of bsa by nabp was a static quenching by forming the bsa - nabp complexes .
the effect of 3,4,5-trifluoro , 4-och3 , 2,5-difluoro , and 3,5-difluoro on the benzene ring enhances the binding affinity of nabp with bsa . according to forster 's theory of nonradiation energy transfer , energy transfer from bsa to nabp occurs with high probability .","1. Introduction

"in the previous issue of critical care , wacharasint and colleagues ' investigation into obesity in septic shock adds to the contradictory studies on the effects of obesity in critical illness . since 1980 , global obesity has nearly doubled , with over 1.4 billion adults overweight or obese , defined by a body mass index ( bmi ) 25 kg / m.obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , and certain malignancies .
yearly , 2.8 million deaths worldwide are attributable to obesity . up to 40% of icu patients
obese icu patients have higher rates of ventilator - associated pneumonia , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , and cardiovascular complications .
early studies found an increased mortality rate in the critically ill obese , particularly in long - stay , morbidly obese ( bmi 40 kg / m ) subjects .
however , more recent literature supports the obesity paradox , the notion that obesity confers a protective effect in certain disease states .
obesity in critical illness appears to exert no effect on mortality , or may even decrease mortality , despite longer icu stay and time to resolve organ failure . in the past two decades , it seems there has been a shift in care and outcomes of the critically ill obese . in wacharasint and colleagues ' cohort of patients in septic shock ,
infection profiles differed , with lower rates of lung and fungal infection in the obese . like other studies , they found that most intensivists still approach adults of varying weights with uniform doses of fluid and vasopressors .
excessive fluid resuscitation may cause harm . perhaps the lower weight - based dose confoundingly leads to a perceived protective effect of obesity . sussing out useful information on
given the contradictory data on inflammatory markers , it is likely that the appropriate complement of markers for study in critical illness remains unidentified . despite the known difficulties of ventilating obese patients given decreased chest wall compliance , increased gastric reflux , increased ventilator - associated pneumonia , and wacharasint and colleagues ' finding of inappropriately high tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation when compared to their nonobese cohort , the obese still had lower rates of lung infection .
these mortality data contradict earlier findings in the critically ill morbidly obese and the use of low tidal volumes in acute lung injury .
how can we explain the decreased mortality in the obese , particularly the morbidly obese , observed in this and other studies ?
we acknowledge that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring systems overestimate the severity of illness in the obese by incorporating markers that differ in otherwise healthy obese patients , like creatinine and oxygenation .
there are three possible explanations for how the obese , especially morbidly obese , may experience better outcomes in the icu today as compared to decades past .
first , and most likely , this special population has received heightened attention and the consequence has been improved outcomes .
icus have developed better turning , skin , mobilization , oral , and pulmonary toilet protocols .
it is possible our inadvertent ' under ' dosing of obese patients ' fluids and vasopressors conferred a protective effect .
imaging tables that support the greater weight of morbidly obese patients have opened upmodalities and improved the diagnosis of life - threatening illness .
improvements in glycemic control have benefited the obese , who are likelier to have dysglycemia and diabetes . improved ventilation and extubation protocols
have probably improved outcomes in the obese who have higher rates of atelectasis , hypoxemia , and obstructive sleep apnea .
second , the observation of an obesity paradox in critical illness typically arises from retrospective or post hoc analyses or meta - analyses of the same .
these studies pose interesting questions but do not prove the existence of an obesity paradox .
even when matching severity of illness in the obese and non - obese , scoring systems do not do justice when comparing a 70 kg patient with a 270 kg patient .
it may be that outcomes in the mildly obese are no worse than for normal or overweight subjects .
third , the finding of an obesity paradox in the critically ill , counter to general population outcomes , may be a mirage , an optical phenomenon that does not actually exist .
that morbid obesity is ' protective ' in critical illness strongly conflicts with bedside observations in the crucible of real life . in the morbidly obese
, emergency airway or vascular access can be difficult to secure , chest compressions are less effective , and simply turning a morbidly obese patient may require up to eight bedside providers .
overall , the protective effect of morbid obesity in critical illness does not pass the ' smell test ' for those working bedside .
discrepant findings in suboptimal studies underscore our lack of understanding of obesity , inflammation and critical illness , and the need for further research .","None

"radiation - induced gastrointestinal disorder is the most common complication of toxicity due to the treatment for malignancies in the abdomen and pelvis , which often reduces the quality of life ( qol ) for patients and occasionally limits the therapeutic dose that can be used for treating abdominal and pelvic tumors with radiotherapy .
modern radiotherapeutic modalities , including intensity - modulated radiation therapy and proton therapy , can significantly decrease the toxicities of radiotherapy and can benefit the outcomes ( 1 ) .
amifostine has been recommended for the prevention of severe radiation - induced toxicities and is the only radioprotectant that has been approved by the us food and drug administration ( 2 ) .
however , the daily use of amifostine has been limited due to its hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity .
polaprezinc ( pz ) is an antiulcer drug and a chelating compound consisting of a zinc ion , l - carnosine , a -alanine dipeptide and l - histidine .
it was previously reported that pz exerts antioxidant effects and scavenges free radicals ( 35 ) .
our previous study reported the efficacy of pz for acute radiation proctitis in an animal model and demonstrated that pz has an anti - inflammatory effect following exposure to radiation ( 6 ) .
however , the radioprotective effects of pz have been reported in only a limited number of reports and remain unclear ( 69 ) .
the purpose of the present study was to examine the optimal timing to administer pz and the pattern of apoptosis in the normal intestine .
it is important that premedication of the clinical medicine enables the prevention of radiation injuries .
male c57bl/6j mice ( 8-weeks - old ; weight , ~20 g ) were used in the present study .
they were housed 45/cage and fed a laboratory rodent pellet formula and tap water ad libitum .
mice were maintained at a constant temperature of 22c0.5c , a humidity of 50%5% and were exposed to 12 h light / dark cycles .
the hyogo college of medicine institutional animal care and use committee approved all animal procedures prior to the initiation of the project ( nos .
the mice orally received 100 mg / kg body weight pz in the drinking water .
the mice were irradiated at a dose rate of ~200 cgy / min using a 150 kvp x - ray unit ( hitachi mbr-1520 ; hitachi , tokyo , japan ; 20 ma ; 150 kv ) . for dosimetry , a probe connected to an electrometer system was placed close to the target site . prior to the experiments
, the present study confirmed that the agents were retained in the whole intestine using an imaging examination with sodium amidotrizoate ( 100 mg / ml ) 2 h after the oral administration of pz ( zeria pharmaceutical co. , ltd . ,
tokyo , japan ; data not shown ) . to examine the optimal timing of the administration of pz for the protective effect on the normal intestine , the present study used an established animal model that measured the intestinal stem cell survival ( as the number of crypts / cross section ) after ionizing radiation ( ir ) .
the detailed procedure for the intestinal crypt cell survival analysis following irradiation has been described previously ( 10 ) .
briefly , the mice were divided into the following three groups : group a , mice that received ir without pz ; group b , mice that received pz 2 h before ir ; group c , mice that received pz 2 h after ir ( n=3/group ) .
the mice were irradiated with a total body irradiation ( tbi ) of 15 gy in a single fraction .
three days after radiation , the mice were sacrificed by injection of pentobarbital ( 200 mg / kg ) in the abdominal cavity , and the duodenum , jejunum and ileum were removed , fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h&e ) .
surviving crypts with 10 cells for each cross - section were counted using microscopy . in the subsequent studies , based on the results
, the mice were divided into two groups : mice that received oral administration of pz 2 h prior to ir [ pz ( + ) group ] and mice that were treated with drinking water without pz [ pz (  ) group ] .
the samples were harvested for a pathological evaluation and were immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution .
the intestine was divided into the duodenum , jejunum and ileum , and was subsequently submitted for a histological analysis .
the radioprotective effects of pz in these two murine groups were evaluated . to examine the suppressive effect of pz on the apoptosis caused by ir in the normal intestine ,
the mice received tbi of 2 gy in a single fraction and were subsequently sacrificed at 0 , 4 and 8 h following ir .
the group for 0 h used two mice for the pz (  ) group and two for the pz ( + ) group , and the group for 4 and 8 h used four mice for the pz (  ) group and four for the pz ( + ) group .
the present study defined apoptotic cells as epithelial cells with apoptotic fragments in the h&e stained tissue sections .
in addition , the proportion of apoptotic cells in each crypt was analyzed to determine an apoptotic index .
the position of apoptotic cells were determined by the numbering from the bottom of the crypt cells .
the data are expressed as the means , with the range in parentheses , unless otherwise indicated .
a statistical analysis was performed to compare the differences between the two or three groups .
for the two groups , the parametric data were analyzed using an unpaired two - tailed f test and the two - tailed student 's t - test .
for the three groups , the parametric data were analyzed using the bartlett test and by a one - way analysis of variance .
when significant differences in the three groups were observed , a multiple comparison using the tukey - kramer method was performed .
in addition , a risk of 5% was defined as a significant difference between the two groups . the statmate iv software program ( atms co. , ltd .

when significant differences in the three groups were observed , a multiple comparison using the tukey - kramer method was performed .
in addition , a risk of 5% was defined as a significant difference between the two groups . the statmate iv software program ( atms co. , ltd .
male c57bl/6j mice ( 8-weeks - old ; weight , ~20 g ) were used in the present study .
they were housed 45/cage and fed a laboratory rodent pellet formula and tap water ad libitum .
mice were maintained at a constant temperature of 22c0.5c , a humidity of 50%5% and were exposed to 12 h light / dark cycles .
the hyogo college of medicine institutional animal care and use committee approved all animal procedures prior to the initiation of the project ( nos .
the mice orally received 100 mg / kg body weight pz in the drinking water .
the mice were irradiated at a dose rate of ~200 cgy / min using a 150 kvp x - ray unit ( hitachi mbr-1520 ; hitachi , tokyo , japan ; 20 ma ; 150 kv ) . for dosimetry , a probe connected to an electrometer system was placed close to the target site .
prior to the experiments , the present study confirmed that the agents were retained in the whole intestine using an imaging examination with sodium amidotrizoate ( 100 mg / ml ) 2 h after the oral administration of pz ( zeria pharmaceutical co. , ltd . ,
tokyo , japan ; data not shown ) . to examine the optimal timing of the administration of pz for the protective effect on the normal intestine , the present study used an established animal model that measured the intestinal stem cell survival ( as the number of crypts / cross section ) after ionizing radiation ( ir ) .
the detailed procedure for the intestinal crypt cell survival analysis following irradiation has been described previously ( 10 ) .
briefly , the mice were divided into the following three groups : group a , mice that received ir without pz ; group b , mice that received pz 2 h before ir ; group c , mice that received pz 2 h after ir ( n=3/group ) .
the mice were irradiated with a total body irradiation ( tbi ) of 15 gy in a single fraction .
three days after radiation , the mice were sacrificed by injection of pentobarbital ( 200 mg / kg ) in the abdominal cavity , and the duodenum , jejunum and ileum were removed , fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h&e ) .
surviving crypts with 10 cells for each cross - section were counted using microscopy . in the subsequent studies , based on the results
, the mice were divided into two groups : mice that received oral administration of pz 2 h prior to ir [ pz ( + ) group ] and mice that were treated with drinking water without pz [ pz (  ) group ] .
the samples were harvested for a pathological evaluation and were immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution .
the intestine was divided into the duodenum , jejunum and ileum , and was subsequently submitted for a histological analysis .
the radioprotective effects of pz in these two murine groups were evaluated . to examine the suppressive effect of pz on the apoptosis caused by ir in the normal intestine ,
the mice received tbi of 2 gy in a single fraction and were subsequently sacrificed at 0 , 4 and 8 h following ir .
the group for 0 h used two mice for the pz (  ) group and two for the pz ( + ) group , and the group for 4 and 8 h used four mice for the pz (  ) group and four for the pz ( + ) group .
the present study defined apoptotic cells as epithelial cells with apoptotic fragments in the h&e stained tissue sections .
in addition , the proportion of apoptotic cells in each crypt was analyzed to determine an apoptotic index .
the position of apoptotic cells were determined by the numbering from the bottom of the crypt cells .
the data are expressed as the means , with the range in parentheses , unless otherwise indicated .
a statistical analysis was performed to compare the differences between the two or three groups .
for the two groups , the parametric data were analyzed using an unpaired two - tailed f test and the two - tailed student 's t - test .
for the three groups , the parametric data were analyzed using the bartlett test and by a one - way analysis of variance . when significant differences in the three groups were observed , a multiple comparison using the tukey - kramer method was performed .
in addition , a risk of 5% was defined as a significant difference between the two groups . the statmate iv software program ( atms co. , ltd .
the present study performed experiments to study the effect of pz on the intestinal crypt survival following 15 gy tbi .
the results demonstrated that the administration of pz decreased the radiation - induced cell death of crypt stem cells in the duodenum , jejunum and ileum .
in addition , pz treatment protected the crypt cells against tbi and increased the number of viable crypt cells in the mice that received pz prior to ir compared with those that received pz after ir ( fig .
the average number of viable intestinal crypts in groups a , b and c was 20.2 , 24.1 and 39.8 in the duodenum ( p=0.04 ) , and 43 , 51.3 and 66.1 in the ileum ( p=0.02 ) , respectively ( fig .
1 ) . in addition , according to the multiple comparison test method , significant differences existed between groups a and c in both the duodenum and ileum .
mice that received premedication of pz exhibited significantly more viable intestinal stem cells in the crypts , compared with those administered pz after ir ( fig .
pz was administered 2 h prior to ir , according to the above mentioned data . in the pathological examination ,
the number of apoptotic cells in the small intestine peaked at 8 h following ir and the oral administration of pz protected the normal intestinal cells from apoptosis caused by ir ( fig .
the apoptotic index in the pz (  ) group was 0.056 , 0.106 and 0.084 in the duodenum , jejunum and ileum , respectively .
the apoptotic index in the pz ( + ) group was 0.022 , 0.044 and 0.052 in the duodenum , jejunum and ileum , respectively .
the p - values between the pz ( + ) and pz (  ) groups were 0.07 , 0.01 and 0.12 in the duodenum , jejunum , and ileum , respectively .
the positions of high apoptotic frequency were observed in lower positions of each crypt in the intestine .
the mice that received pz exhibited less apoptotic cells in each position of crypts ( figs . 4 and 5 ) .
gastrointestinal toxicity commonly occurs as a complication of radiotherapy for malignancy in the abdomen and pelvis , which significantly decreases a patient 's qol ( 2,11 ) .
in addition , no standardized treatment options are currently available to prevent gastrointestinal toxicity ( 2 ) .
pz , which is a chelating compound consisting of a zinc ion , l - carnosine and l - histidine , has been reported to possess superoxide scavenging activity ( 3 ) .
it has also been previously reported that pz exerts its effects via a variety of cytoprotective mechanisms , including the suppression of lipid peroxidation , reduction of the levels of various cytokines , inhibition of superoxide generation and promotion of the restoration of the gastric mucosa ( 35 ) .
our previous study reported the efficacy of pz for acute radiation proctitis in a rat model and demonstrated the anti - inflammatory effect of pz on radiation - induced mucosal damage ( 6 ) .
in addition , the clinical use of pz has been reported to be feasible and can increase a patient 's qol during radiotherapy ( 8,9 ) . in the present study ,
the pretreatment of pz revealed improved protective effects in the mice that received pz prior to radiation exposure compared with those that received pz after radiation exposure and those that were irradiated without pz .
this is the first report , to the best of our knowledge , that demonstrated the optimal timing for pz treatment as a radioprotectant .
radiotherapy is generally performed in a fractionated schedule with the aim of maximizing the anti - tumor effect and minimizing the toxicity of normal organs in the clinical practice .
however , the present study used a single fraction schedule to examine the efficacy of pz .
therefore , the optimization of the administration of pz and ir must be evaluated in future studies .
matsuu - matsuyama et al ( 7 ) have reported that pz can protect the normal intestine from radiation - induced apoptosis via the suppression of p53 , p21 and b - cell associated x protein genes .
however , the mechanism of the radioprotective effect of pz treatment for radiation - induced mucosal damages remains to be investigated in greater detail .
the present study examined the potential differences in the sensitivity of pz treatment in various positions of the crypts in the intestine since intestinal stem cells , which are critical drivers of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration , have been reported to localize to the lower areas in each crypt ( 12 ) .
it was revealed that radiation induced apoptosis in the low positions from the base of the crypt axis , which was reduced following pz treatment .
in addition , the present study also demonstrated the radioprotective effect of pz in the established - intestinal crypt stem cell assay . according to these results
, pz protects the intestinal stem cells from cell death caused by ir and can reduce gastrointestinal toxicity associated with radiotherapy .
cytoprotection of radioprotectants can include joint binding between the tumor cells and normal cells , since reactive oxygen species are believed to serve a significant role in radiotherapy delivered by photons .
there is , however , little data of the negative effects of pz use for tumor control and the survival outcomes of the patients who received pz as a supportive treatment have been poorly understood .
however , no direct evidence has suggested that the use of pz can lead to inferior tumor outcomes in patients with malignancies ( 8,9 ) .
watanabe et al ( 8) reported that the initial responses of tumors to radiotherapy were not affected by the pz intake in a randomized clinical trial .
in addition , our previous study recently reported that patients who received a pz - containing rinse showed no inferior survival outcomes compared with those that did not received pz in a retrospective study ( 9 ) .
the present study administered pz 2 h prior to ir in order to distribute pz to whole intestine , according to the findings from our preliminary data .
in addition , myagmarjalbuu et al ( 13 ) have reported the gastrointestinal transit time was 2 h in mice .
it has been previously reported that pz causes its pharmacological effect by adhesion to damaged mucosa ( 4,6 ) .
however , the time between the administration of pz and ir can increase the serum zinc concentration ( 12 ) .
therefore , further studies to determine the mechanism of the radioprotective effects of pz are required . in conclusion ,","Introduction

"endocrine malignancies , including carcinomas of the thyroid , adrenal , and ovary , are relatively rare tumors deriving from cells present in endocrine glands .
surgery is currently the treatment of choice for these tumors and is often successful in early stages of disease .
however , this therapeutic approach for the advanced tumors remains unsatisfactory and is associated with poor prognosis .
thus , a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the critical intracellular networks underlying endocrine oncogenesis may help in discovering new targets that could represent promising therapeutic options for these malignancies .
as specific pituitary tropins control the trophism and function of specific endocrine glands , it is tempting to speculate about a possible role for these pituitary hormones in endocrine glands tumorigenesis .
however , this assumption is controversial as other signaling effectors , including the igf system , have often a major role in endocrine tumorigenesis .
this paper covers the recent molecular advances in this field focusing on the role of the igf system in endocrine tumorigenesis with particular attention on the endocrine cancers best characterized until now ( i.e. , thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian tumors ) .
several molecular alterations associated with thyroid tumorigenesis have been identified and often converge into the activation of mapk ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) and pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ) signaling pathways .
its mitogenic actions are mainly mediated by camp , which in turn activates protein kinase a ( pka ) dependent and independent pathways . activating mutations of the tsh receptor ( tshr ) or of the gene encoding the gs subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein that couples tshr to adenylyl cyclase ( gsp ) have been described in 30% of autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas while they are rare in thyroid carcinomas [ 2 , 3 ] .
tsh , however , has a well - known promoting role for thyroid cancer metastases , and tsh suppressive therapy with l - thyroxine is a well - established therapy in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer . to exert its maximal mitogenic effects
studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] .
tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin or igf - i , which can thus be qualified as the only genuine mitogens .
in fact , the protumorigenic effects of tsh are irrelevant in the absence of growth factors , but they are greatly potentiated by the presence of insulin or igf - i at physiological concentrations [ 5 , 8 ] .
furthermore , we have recently reported a key role of the igf system in the biology of follicular thyroid progenitor / stem cells .
insulin / igf - i signaling pathways are important also in the regulation of thyroid - specific genes transcription , including the tsh receptor , thyroglobulin ( tg ) , and thyroperoxidase ( tpo ) [ 11 , 12 ] . gene expression of both tg   and tpo   is mediated predominantly by thyroid transcription factor-2 ( ttf-2 ) , a thyroid - specific transcription factor that binds to the promoter of both genes [ 15 , 16 ] and is stimulated by both the camp and the insulin / igf - i pathways , which may have additive effects . regarding the adrenocortical cancers , their molecular pathogenesis is still incompletely understood .
in contrast to thyroid carcinomas , the camp / pka pathway seems to be less involved in the development of these tumors .
although pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) stimulates adrenal function by inducing steroidogenic enzymes and increases adrenal gland weight , the proliferative action of acth for adrenal tumors has been questioned , and opposite effects , under defined cell culture conditions , have been reported . in vitro inhibition of adrenal cell proliferation by physiological acth concentrations has been reported by several groups [ 1821 ] . in support of the growth - inhibiting effect of acth
, no activating mutations of the acth receptor have been found in benign or malignant adrenocortical tumors [ 22 , 23 ] .
conversely , allelic loss of the acth receptor gene has been reported in a subset of sporadic benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors where it was associated with undifferentiated phenotype and worse prognosis .
these data tend to exclude a role of acth receptor as putative oncogene in adrenal oncogenesis while supporting its role as tumor suppressor . in summary , in the adrenal cortex , the acth / pka signaling is mainly involved in regulating steroid hormone synthesis and cellular differentiation rather than in controlling cellular proliferation and tumor growth . similarly to thyroid cancer ,
molecular alterations frequently observed in adrenocortical carcinoma include deregulation of the igf system as well as mutations in p53 and ras .
in addition to igf - ii overexpression , increased levels of the igf - ir and igfbp-2 have been found in advanced human adrenal carcinomas , resulting in increased igf - dependent cell proliferation and inhibition of the acth antiproliferative effect .
although the functional significance of the strong and specific overexpression of igfs in adrenocortical carcinomas remains still unknown , these factors may regulate both steroidogenic and mitogenic effects and , similarly to what is seen in thyroid cancer , establish autocrine positive loops that promote growth advantage and transformation toward a more malignant phenotype . in ovarian cancers ,
pituitary lh and fsh lead to increased sex steroids secretion which may favor ovarian cancer development [ 26 , 27 ] . a role for gonadotropins in ovarian tumorigenesis
is also supported by the observation that ovarian cancer incidence reaches a peak in the postmenopausal period , during which fsh levels are particularly high . yet
, a study on normal rabbit ovarian surface epithelium showed that fsh and lh / hcg stimulate growth in vitro .
for instance , a more recent study has reported no increase in cell proliferation with lh . although the mechanisms by which fsh and lh stimulate or inhibit the proliferation of ovarian epithelium remain still unknown , these hormones exert their effects interacting with their specific receptors .
some ovarian cancers , especially those poorly differentiated , lose fsh receptor ( fshr ) expression .
this observation suggests that fsh may be a growth - promoting factor important at early stages of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis , with some ovarian tumors losing their requirement for fsh later in tumor development . like adrenal and thyroid cancers , also in ovarian tumors
igf - ii appears to increase proliferation and induce differentiation in granulosa cells via the igf - ir and synergizes with fsh to induce steroidogenesis as well as mitogenesis .
this synergism likely involves igf - induced upregulation of the fshr [ 31 , 32 ] and/or the involvement of intracellular mechanisms leading to the activation of intracellular pathways ( i.e. , protein kinase c , camp , mapk , and pi3k ) .
a schematic representation of the interplay between pituitary hormones and main signaling pathways of the igf system in thyroid , adrenal , and ovary cancers is shown in figure 1 .
altogether , the lines of evidence reported in these three tumor histotypes suggest that , although the specific pituitary tropin exerts an important role in regulating the growth , differentiation , and function of the target endocrine gland , the interplay of pituitary hormones with other factors , such as the igf system , is crucial for deregulated cell proliferation and transformation .
the igf system may represent , therefore , a promising therapeutical target for these tumors .
in mammals the igf system includes four receptors ( the insulin receptor ( ir ) , the igf - i receptor ( igf - ir ) , the insulin - receptor - related receptor ( irr ) , and the mannose-6-phosphate / igf - ii receptor ( igf - iir ) ) , four ligands ( proinsulin , insulin , igf - i , and igf - ii ) , and six high - affinity binding proteins ( igfp-1 to 6 ) .
the human ir exists in two isoforms ( ir - a and ir - b ) generated by alternative splicing of the ir gene with the exclusion ( ir - a ) or inclusion ( ir - b ) of 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 .
the ir and the igf - ir have highly homologous structure , but different functions .
given the high degree of homology , ir and igf - ir can heterodimerize leading to the formation of insulin / igf - i hybrid receptors ( hrs ) [ 33 , 34 ] .
the igf - iir is a structurally distinct cell surface receptor whose major function is to induce internalization and degradation of igf - ii , thus modulating its extracellular levels .   with regard to the ligands ,
insulin and igfs are related peptides , involved in metabolism as well as in growth and reproduction .
insulin largely circulates in free form while more than 90% of igfs circulates bound to a complex family of igf - binding proteins ( igfbps ) , which regulate both the half - life and the biological effects of igfs .
insulin and igfs bind with different affinity ir isoforms and igf - ir ( for more details see [ 3638 ] ) .
recently , it has been reported that proinsulin , the insulin prohormone , which is characterized by low metabolic activity compared to mature insulin , is a selective ir - a ligand and may exert a putative role on growth and cell proliferation [ 39 , 40 ] .
after ligand binding , phosphorylated receptors activate two main signaling pathways , the pi3k and the mapk cascade , involved in the regulation of cell metabolism , proliferation , and survival .
although both the ir and igf - ir similarly activate these signaling networks , subtle differences exist in the recruitment of certain intracellular mediators and substrates between the two receptors , leading to the specific biological effects of each hormone .
details regarding the igf system have been previously covered by several reviews to which we refer for more information [ 34 , 36 , 41 ] . since the igf system exerts a pivotal role in cell growth and homeostasis , it is not surprising that aberrant expression of receptors belonging to this system might be involved in cancer development , progression , and metastasis .
the key role of igf - ir in oncogenic transformation derives from the studies showing that igf - ir null cells can not be transformed by several cellular or viral oncogenes , whereas they become susceptible to the oncogenic mediated transformation after the reintroduction of a functional igf - ir [ 42 , 43 ] .
however , increased levels of igf - ir do not result in autonomous receptor signaling in the absence of igf ligand , while it can induce malignant transformation in presence of its specific ligands . similarly , in estrogen responsive breast cancer cell lines , growth response to insulin could be specifically inhibited by anti - ir but not anti - igf - ir blocking antibodies while it can be mimicked by an anti - ir stimulating antibody .
these data are in agreement with studies indicating that ir - transfected cells acquire insulin - dependent malignant changes [ 46 , 47 ] and support the notion that ir may elicit mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects similar to igf - ir , contributing to cancer development and progression .
the first direct evidence that ir may be overexpressed in cancer cells was reported by papa et al . in breast tumors .
subsequent studies demonstrated that ir is also overexpressed in other human malignancies , including endocrine tumors , such as cancer of the thyroid , ovary , and adrenal glands [ 38 , 4850 ] . in most of these tumors ,
cell growth is dependent on ir activation by insulin , suggesting a mitogenic role of this hormone , although ir , isoform a , may also be activated by igf - ii [ 46 , 52 , 53 ] .
both ir isoforms may be overexpressed in cancer , but usually ir - a is predominant , representing 60100% of total ir .
data showing an increased relative abundance of ir - a are also available for certain endocrine cancers [ 38 , 48 , 54 ] .
this observation is particularly interesting , as ir - a is mainly expressed in fetal life , while ir - b predominates in differentiated tissues [ 38 , 55 ] .
furthermore , at variance with ir - b , which is a highly specific receptor for insulin , ir - a is a high - affinity receptor for insulin ; it shows intermediate affinity for igf - ii and low affinity for igf - i .
although igf - ii is able to bind both to igf - ir and ir - a with similar affinity , its binding to ir - a has important implications .
indeed , ir - a overexpression amplifies igf - ii effects in cancer cells and serves as a signaling diversification factor , as ir - a and igf - ir activate different downstream signals . because of the high homology between the ir and the igf - ir , in cells coexpressing irs and igf - ir   hybrid ir / igf - ir receptors ( hrs ) may form [ 5860 ] .
functionally , hrs are considered high - affinity igf - i - binding sites as they bind insulin with much lower affinity . in thyroid cancers
large amounts of hrs have been measured both in well - differentiated papillary carcinomas and in poorly differentiated / undifferentiated carcinomas , probably as a consequence of increased ir expression . in these tumors ,
hrs account for 5075% of the total igf - i binding sites and mediate igf - i mitogenic signaling .
ir and igf - ir share many similarities not only in their structures but also in their downstream signaling pathways . upon ligand
binding , the intrinsic tyrosine kinases of both ir and igf - ir are activated and this results in the phosphorylation of several receptor substrates including the components of the irs family and shc . these substrates , in turn ,
proteins for kinases and adaptors , such as pi3k , syp , fyn , nck , and grb2 , which trigger the activation of downstream kinase cascades .
irs proteins are also involved in the crosstalk with other signaling pathways , including those coming from other growth factors , cytokines , and integrins .
the two main signaling pathways downstream to ir and igf - ir include the mitogen - activated protein kinases cascade ( mapks ) , which involves the sequential activation of a cascade of serine / threonine protein kinases with a key role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and gene expression and the pi3k signaling pathway , which mediates metabolic actions but also stimulates cell growth and survival .
both mapk and pi3k pathways enhance protein synthesis through mtor activation and trigger antiapoptotic effects through the phosphorylation and inactivation of bad
. molecular alterations ( mutational and nonmutational ) in both pi3k and mapk have been reported in several malignancies including those from thyroid , ovary , and adrenal glands .
conditional or constitutive deregulation of mapk and pi3k cascades is a common event in thyroid cancer and may play a pathogenetic role in this tumor .
indeed , deregulated activation of the mapk cascade via mutations and/or rearrangements in ret , ras , and braf genes occurs in ~70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas ( the most common subtype of thyroid cancers ) [ 6668 ] .
thyroid carcinomas also show mutations in pi3k signaling effectors such as pten and phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( pik3ca ) .
pten is downregulated in ~37% of well - differentiated thyroid carcinomas and downregulated or lost in > 50% of highly malignant thyroid cancers ; point mutations or copy number changes in pik3ca are found in ~23% of anaplastic thyroid cancers where they can coexist with either ras or braf mutations . in adrenal cancer ,
pathway analysis for the genomic regions associated with poor prognosis has shown deletions of genes that negatively regulate the activation of erk1/2 and loss of pten gene . yet
, several reports have identified activating ras mutations [ 72 , 73 ] , while only two papers have analyzed mutations in braf gene and found that their prevalence is low [ 74 , 75 ] . although functional studies are needed to better characterize the effect of these mutations in adrenocortical tumors , it is possible that deregulation in the mapk pathway may significantly contribute to aggressive phenotypes . in ovarian cancer ,
mutually exclusive mutations of kras and braf have been described in about 3050% of low - grade tumors [ 7679 ] , while they are rare in high - grade tumors .
ras mutations may promote ovarian tumorigenesis not only through mapk but also via the interaction with the pi3k / akt pathway . in ovarian cancers
pi3k activation , occurring via either pik3ca gene amplification / mutations or pten protein loss , has been reported by several studies [ 8083 ] with the highest frequency in most malignant histotypes . in the context of the three endocrine tumors mentioned above
, the dysregulation of the igf system may represent one nonmutational mechanism activating mapk and pi3k signaling cascades .
the increased igf - ir - mediated activation of mapk / pi3k signaling may , in turn , induce igf - ir and/or its ligands expression and reduce the expression of igfbp-3 [ 8587 ] .
this close relationship between the igf system and mapk / pi3k - mediated signals may contribute to cancer development , progression , invasion , and aggressive behavior .
indeed , via pi3k / akt / pten and erk dependent mechanisms [ 8890 ] , igfs control several cycle checkpoints , in particular the g0-g1 transition , increasing cyclin d1 and cdk4 gene expression and down - regulating the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor ( cdki ) p27 .
moreover , through the same pathways , igfs regulate cell invasion and tumor - dependent angiogenesis modulating the expression of molecular mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling and degradation including type iv collagenases , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( mmp-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( mmp-9 ) , and the membrane type 1 mmp ( mmp-14 ) [ 91 , 92 ] .
these enzymes play an important role in malignant progression and metastatic spread of solid tumors , including endocrine ones .
mmps expression has been found to be elevated in papillary thyroid cancer as compared with normal thyroid tissue [ 93 , 94 ] .
a strong mmp2 expression has been also found in malignant adrenal tumors and considered an unfavorable prognostic factor . in ovarian cancers
, mmps are frequently overexpressed and appear to be an early event of ovarian tumorigenesis suggesting a role of these enzymes in ovarian tumor initiation and not only in tumor progression and invasion .
relevant crosstalks between the igf system and other signaling pathways also include the involvement of the janus kinase ( jak)-1/2 mediated signaling and the activation of transcription proteins stat .
in particular , stat-3 may be required for the maintenance of transforming activity of igf - ir .
igf - i is able to activate stat-3 , but not stat-5 , and this activation is probably mediated by jak proteins .
these mechanisms have been demonstrated in several models , and they may also occur in endocrine cancers , where both stat and igf signaling play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasization . indeed , the stat-3 pathway is significantly upregulated in metastatic thyroid papillary cancers , suggesting a potential role for activated stat-3 in lymphatic metastases . yet , in both ovarian and adrenal cancers a role for stat signaling in invasion and cancer prognosis has been also identified [ 99 , 100 ] .
other molecules interacting with the igf system and involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian cancers include the tumor suppressor p53 .
inactivating mutations of p53 gene occur in 10% , 47% , and 25% of thyroid , ovary , and adrenal sporadic carcinomas [ 101 , 102 ] , respectively .
however , in all these tumors , also when not mutated , p53 activity may be inhibited by other mechanisms among which are an unbalanced expression of isoforms with a dominant negative function , the interaction with mdm2 , and the cooperation with other members of the p53 family such as tap63 , tap73 , and their dominant negative variants ( np63 and np73 ) .
the activity of wild - type p53 reduces igf axis activity by multiple mechanisms which include inhibition of igf - ir , ir , and igf - ii expression   with a concomitant increase of igfbp-3 transcription .
therefore , aberrant p53 ( i.e. , p53 lacking its suppressor function through point mutations or via other mechanisms ) greatly enhances the activity of igf axis at multiple levels . in the three endocrine tumors mentioned above
, the crosstalk between the igf system and p53 appears an important prerequisite for oncogene - driven tumor cell trasformation , cancer progression , and resistance to anticancer therapies .
epidemiological studies have shown that elevated plasma concentrations of igfs are associated to increased risk for the development of several human malignancies including cancers of the breast , colon , and prostate as well as sarcomas [ 61 , 108113 ] .
for instance , several studies have provided strong evidence that premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , women in the highest tertile of serum igf - i levels had an increased risk of developing breast cancer , and that a high igf - i  :  igfbp-3 ratio may be associated with greater breast density and increased breast cancer risk [ 108 , 115 ] .
high circulating igfs concentrations may exert biological effects in malignant cells not only through igf - ir but also via ir - a and hrs .
as described in more detail below , all these receptors are overexpressed in endocrine cancers [ 31 , 48 ] as well as in thyroid cancer stem - like cells . a possible role for serum
igf - i in thyroid cancerogenesis has been suggested by the observation that acromegalic patients , who are exposed to sustained high serum igf - i levels , show an increased frequency of thyroid cancer [ 116 , 117 ] . in adrenocortical tumors high serum igfs and low igfbp3 levels are correlated with cancer risk and are predictive of metastases development [ 111 , 118 ] .
finally , some haplotypes and snps in the igf components may influence ovarian risk , either directly or by increasing the igf - i plasma levels .
in particular , the following snps in the igfbps ( rs10228265 , rs4988515 , rs2270628 , rs2854746 , and rs2854744 ) , in igf - i ( rs11111285 , rs1996656 and rs1019731 ) , and in igf - ii ( rs4320932 , rs4244809 , rs680 , rs1003483 , and rs7924316 ) have been associated with increased ovarian cancer risk [ 119 , 120 ] .
not only igfs but also circulating insulin has been suggested to be involved in the tumorigenesis process .
indeed , a number of population studies have provided substantial and circumstantial lines of evidence that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia , common factors underlying obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) , are strong candidates for the increased cancer risk associated with these disorders [ 121123 ] .
although insulin is considered a hormone regulating energy metabolism , it also exerts proliferative , antiapoptotic , and migratory actions , collectively indicated as  mitogenic effects ,  via its own receptor ( ir ) . this observation is known from long time and helps in understanding the link between insulin resistance / hyperinsulinemia and cancer .
the involvement of insulin in cell trasformation and cancer development was firstly suggested by in vivo evidence that administration of insulin induced growth of mammary tumor in mice   and promoted aberrant crypt foci in the colon of rats [ 125127 ] , while insulin deficiency or calorie restriction exerted a protective role .
similarly , in obese mice , insulin levels were positively associated with the proliferation of transplanted lung and colon cancer cells . in light of these experimental lines of evidence ,
clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the possible role of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in endocrine tumors . at this regard , several case - control and prospective studies
have found a strong positive association between overweight / obesity and thyroid cancer risk [ 128137 ] , although the data are not entirely consistent [ 138145 ] .
the exact nature of the relationship between body mass index ( bmi ) and thyroid cancer incidence remains still unclear . besides the high circulating levels of insulin present in overweight / obese patients , other potential mechanisms may include increased levels of inflammatory adipokines .
in addition , although obesity is associated with poor prognosis for several malignancies , this relationship has not been reported for thyroid cancer . in partial support with the finding that hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are risk factors for thyroid cancer , studies conducted in t2 dm patients
have shown that higher fasting glucose levels are associated with increased thyroid cancer risk [ 144 , 147 ] . however , also for this association conflicting results have been obtained . concerning the association between hyperinsulinemia / insulin resistance and ovarian cancer risk ,
several lines of evidence suggest that women affected by polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) , a condition associated with insulin - resistance , are more likely to develop ovarian cancer ( or , 2.5 ; 95% ci 1.085.89 ) . furthermore
, a meta - analysis of ten cohort studies has shown that overweight and obesity are associated with higher ovarian cancer mortality ( or , 1.6 ; 95% ci 1.12.34 ) and that , among patients with advanced ovarian cancer , premorbid obesity is associated with worse prognosis ( or , 1.5 ; 95% ci 1.091.93 ) .
however , other studies have not supported these results , suggesting that further investigation is needed to firmly establish the association between ovarian cancer and insulin resistance . finally , it has been suggested that adrenal incidentalomas , usually benign tumors , might be related to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance .
this hypothesis was postulated for the first time by reincke et al . , who observed a proliferative effect of insulin on adrenal cancer cells without effect on cortisol synthesis .
however , a causative role of adrenal incidentalomas for metabolic syndrome can not be excluded , as some patients show a slight hypercortisolism that may contribute to the insulin resistance . in fact , surgical tumor resection may revert or ameliorate these metabolic alterations . regarding the link between hyperinsulinemia and malignant adrenal tumors , scanty data are present in the literature so far .
human thyroid carcinomas derived from the thyroid follicular cells ( tfcs ) include a variety of histotypes ranging from well - differentiated ( papillary and follicular ) to undifferentiated ( anaplastic ) cancers .
altogether , they represent approximately 1% ( 3% in women ) of all human cancers [ 154 , 155 ] . well - differentiated thyroid carcinomas account for approximately 90% of all thyroid cancers .
they retain a variable degree of tsh responsiveness and have a mortality rate of approximately 10% . poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas account for only approximately 10% of all thyroid cancers ; they have weak or no tsh responsiveness and have a mortality rate ranging from 50% to 100% [ 48 , 156 ] .
as previously mentioned , the igf - i system plays an important role in regulating normal growth and development in the thyroid [ 6 , 9 ] and appears also to be involved in thyroid tumorigenesis .
the coexpression of igf - i and its cognate receptor , igf - ir , has been documented by various studies in both cultured thyroid cells and tissue specimens . in particular ,
cultured human and ovine thyrocytes are able to release igf - i in the culture media [ 157 , 158 ] .
also , thyroid adenoma cell lines synthesize igf - i , which stimulates cell growth by autocrine mechanisms .
immunoreactive igf - i and igfbps were also found in the extracts of normal and nodular thyroid tissue specimens obtained at surgery from patients with nontoxic goiter [ 160162 ] ( table 1 ) .
functional igf - ir is usually expressed at high levels in thyroid cancer cells . in sw579 thyroid carcinoma cells
igf - i induced angiogenic activity via increased synthesis of hif-1  transcription factor and consequent stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) expression .
igf - i content ranged from 104 to 2566  nm / g in cancer tissue and 69 to 680  nm / g in normal thyroid tissue . by using a specific elisa
, they also found that igf - ir is overexpressed in both thyroid cancer cell lines and specimens as compared to the normal tissue   ( table 1 ) .
igf - ir overexpression in thyroid cancer specimens has been also found by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization , and igf - i was found to be produced in either paracrine or autocrine manner [ 8 , 164 ] .
igf - i and igf - ir immunoreactivity was found to be increased both in adenomas and carcinomas compared with normal thyroid .
igf - i overexpression was more marked in the undifferentiated and poorly differentiated histotypes of thyroid cancer .
the above - mentioned study of vella et al . demonstrated that thyroid cancers overexpress not only igf - i and igf - ir , but also igf - ii and ir . in particular , the igf - ii / ir - a autocrine loop is especially activated in poorly differentiated and anaplastic cancers .
the relative abundance of ir - a also increases in dedifferentiated cancers . in this context , the igf - ir seems less important than ir - a in mediating igf - ii mitogenic effects , and blocking antibodies to ir markedly reduced the effects of igf - ii .
the concomitant high expression of both igf - ir and ir - a in thyroid cancer cells causes overexpression of ir / igf - ir hybrid receptors , which , in most cases , exceed the igf - ir content . in cells with a high ir
/ igf - ir content , blocking antibodies specific to these receptors substantially inhibited igf - i - induced cell growth .
these data indicate that , in addition to igf - ir and ir - a , also ir / igf - ir hybrids may be a target in thyroid cancers   ( table 1 ) .
progenitor / stem cells are increasingly considered to be at the origin of most malignancies . therefore , we recently isolated progenitor / stem cells from both normal and cancer specimens and cultured them as thyrospheres , in order to study the igf system in this model .
we found that igf - i and igf - ii are produced at high levels by all thyrospheres .
however , the igf - i  :  igf - ii ratio was approximately 5  :  1 in normal thyrospheres whereas it was 1  :  1 in cancer thyrospheres .
ir and igf - ir in human thyrospheres were markedly overexpressed and with a higher ir  :  igf - ir ratio as compared to primary cultures .
the ir  :  igf - ir ratio was also higher in cancer than in normal thyrospheres .
receptors ( ir and igf - ir ) and ligands ( igf - i and igf - ii ) , all expressed at high levels in thyrospheres , markedly decreased in differentiating cells .
ir - a was the predominant isoform in thyrospheres , especially from cancer , while ir - b was predominant in differentiating cells .
ir - a relative abundance was associated with characteristics of stemness and with cancer : it ranged from 65 to 86% in cancer thyrospheres , from 50 to 65% in normal thyrospheres , and from 40 to 45% in normal thyroid primary cultures or differentiated sphere - derived thyrocytes .
the expression of ir , igf - ir , and their ligands was evaluated by quantitative real - time pcr .
cancer thyrosphere growth was stimulated by insulin and igfs , while igf - ii was most potent in inducing cell renewal   ( table 1 ) .
considering the involvement of igf - i system in thyroid cancer [ 9 , 55 , 156 ] , wang et al .
studied the potential therapeutic role of anti - igf - ir humanized monoclonal antibody a12 both in vitro and in vivo . in accordance to other studies , they found that igf - ir is expressed in various human thyroid cancer cell lines and in normal and neoplastic human thyroid tissues , including surgical specimens of papillary and anaplastic carcinomas .
igf - ir antibody a12 was able to significantly inhibit the proliferation of cultured anaplastic cancer cells by downregulating the igf - ir signaling pathway .
moreover , administration of a12 also reduced tumor volume in an orthotopic anaplastic cancer nude mouse model and prolonged survival   ( table 2 ) .
the ppar agonists thiazolidinediones and biguanides ( metformin ) are used as antidiabetic drugs for their insulin - sensitizing effect achieved by different mechanisms .
because of these effects , both these classes of drugs lower circulating insulin levels , and , in principle , they may have favorable effects in patients with ir - overexpressing tumors .
moreover , both thiazolidinediones and metformin have direct and pleiotropic anti - igf effects in cultured cancer cells .
in particular , in anaplastic thyroid cancer ( atc ) cells , rosiglitazone antagonized the biological effects of igf - i by upregulating phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 ( pten ) and consequently inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi3k)/akt signaling pathway .
as a consequence , it reduced anchorage - dependent and -independent growth and migration , increased apoptosis rate , and induced partial redifferentiation in these cancer cells .
recently , chen et al . evaluated the effects of metformin , in atc cell lines and in thyroid cancer stem cells .
they found that metformin antagonized the growth - stimulatory effect of insulin in thyroid cancer cell lines .
specifically , metformin inhibited cell cycle progression , inhibited clonal cell growth , and reduced thyroid cancer sphere formation .
moreover , the metformin potentiated the antimitogenic effect of chemotherapeutic agents , such as doxorubicin and cisplatin , in atc cells   ( table 2 ) .
may produce glucocorticoids , androgens , mineralocorticoids , estrogens , and combinations thereof . the vast majority of adrenocortical tumors are benign , while adrenocortical carcinomas ( accs ) are relatively rare ; they presents with extremely poor prognosis as a consequence of metastases or local invasion .
the frequency of small benign adrenocortical tumors increases with age , ranging between 3 and 7% of all adrenal carcinomas in adults over 50 years .
however , accs account for only 0.050.2% of all cancers , with an estimated incidence between 1 and 2 per million and per year in adults in north america and europe [ 174 , 175 ] . in children ,
the incidence is approximately 10-fold lower except in south brazil where there is a high incidence of pediatric acc .
as previously mentioned , the igf system has a physiological role in normal adrenal growth and development   and is also involved in acc proliferation and progression .
an increased expression of the igf - ir was demonstrated in sw13 and in h295r human adrenocortical carcinoma cell lines .
both igf - i and igf - ii are produced by h295r cells , and igf - ii increases during proliferation . in the same cell model
an igf - ir blocking antibody ( -ir3 ) was able to hamper cell growth , demonstrating that autocrine igf - ii production may stimulate cell growth through the igf - ir   ( table 1 ) . in the reticularis layer of normal adrenal tissues a large number of igf - i - positive cells with granular cytoplasmic ( gc ) staining pattern are present .
the proportion of these cells increases with the tumorigenesis process ; hyperplastic glands show 1050% of igf - i - positive cells , while adenomas and carcinomas have over 50% of igf - i positive cells in 64% and 83% of cases , respectively .
similarly , the igf - ir is more expressed in adenomatous adrenal tissues than in nontumoral tissues .
igf - ii is one of the most expressed genes in adrenocortical carcinomas [ 183 , 184 ] .
the igf - ii gene is located at locus 11p15 , which is maternally imprinted and consequently expressed only from the paternal allele .
structural abnormalities , characterized by the loss of maternal allele with the duplication of paternal allele , lead to biallelic expression of igf - ii gene .
these alterations are frequently observed in sporadic adult accs , but only rarely in adenomas [ 118 , 185 , 186 ] .
high igf - ii mrna levels are associated with a more aggressive phenotype of acc and a 5-fold increased risk of recurrence [ 180 , 187 ] ( table 1 ) . in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( pepck )
promoter human igf - ii transgenic mice , postnatal overexpression of igf - ii induced significantly increased adrenal weights , mainly caused by hyperplasia of the zona fasciculate .
this is in accordance with elevated serum corticosterone levels in igf - ii transgenic animals .
however , the observation that transgenic mice overexpressing igfs or igfbp-2 do not develop adrenal tumors indicates that igf - ii alone is not a tumor initiator for adrenal cells but rather a tumor progression factor that requires additional effectors for triggering adrenal tumorigenesis .
this notion is also supported by the clinical observation that deregulation of the igf system is a late event often associated with advanced stage of the disease and poor clinical prognosis [ 118 , 180 , 190 ] .
indeed , in a cohort of pediatric and adult patients with adrenocortical tumors , igf - ii transcripts were mainly overexpressed in adult accs compared to adenomas . yet ,
a microarray analysis of 24 pediatric adrenocortical tumors ( 5 adenomas , 18 carcinomas , and 1 undetermined ) demonstrated that the median expression of igf - ii in adrenocortical tumors was 18 times higher than in normal adrenal glands .
igf - ir   and the igf - binding protein-2 ( igfbp-2 )   are also specifically overexpressed in accs .
these molecular alterations may trigger a cascade of molecular events that can ultimately lead to malignancy in adrenocortical tumor progression .
this notion is confirmed by studies in adrenocortical tumor mouse cell line y1 , which have shown that stable transfection with human igf - ir cdna results in increased mitogenic response ( + 140% ) to igf - i as compared with nontransfected y1 cells . in igf - ir
transfected cells the antiproliferative effect of acth was blunted and could be further antagonized by exogenous igf - i   ( table 1 ) . in order to further clarify the significance of the igf - ir in tumorigenesis of the human adrenal gland , weber et al . examined the binding characteristics and concentrations of igf - ir in normal adult human adrenocortical glands and in adrenocortical tumours of various origin .
igf ir binding in adrenocortical hyperplasias and adenomas was similar than in normal adrenocortical tissue .
in contrast , three out of four hormonally active accs showed strongly elevated specific igf - i binding with a 3 - 4-fold increase in igf - ir concentration , as compared with normal adrenocortical tissue .
h295r cells overexpress also igfbp-2 , which accounts for only 12% of the igfbp activity in normal adrenocortical cells , but seems to play a specific role in the progression of accs by modulating igf - ii activity . in support of the hypothesis of a tumor - growth - promoting effect of igfbp-2
is the observation that y-1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells overexpressing igfbp-2 show increased tumorigenic potential and cell proliferation .
however , the mechanisms of the igfbp-2-associated increase in adrenal tumorigenesis remain largely unclear ( see below ) .
although the regulation of igfbp production by igfs is highly cell and species specific , a stimulatory effect of igfs on igfbp-3 has been reported in a large variety of cell systems [ 168 , 198204 ] .
treatment of adult human adrenocortical cells with acth predominantly stimulated the abundance of igfbp-1 and to a lesser extent that of igfbp-3 , while igf - i and igf - ii selectively induced the accumulation of igfbp-3 and igfbp-5 in the medium [ 205 , 206 ] .
quantification of the specific bands by  counting revealed that igfbp-3 accounts for more than half of the detected igfbp activity , followed by igfbp-1 with 20% and igfbp-4 with approximately 10% .
the gene expression profiles of igfs system component may even distinguish malignant and benign tumours . by analyzing the transcriptional profiles in 7 patients with accs and 13 with adenomas , velzquez - fernndez et al .
showed that in accs several igf - related genes as igf - ii , igf - ir , igfbp3 , and igfbp6 were most significantly upregulated .
recently , mirnas able to regulate the igf expression pattern in childhood adrenocortical tumors have been identified .
functional analysis of these mirnas showed mir-99a and mir-100 regulate expression of igf - ir , mtor , and rictor in adrenocortical cancer cells , acting on target sites in their 3-utr regions .
downregulation of endogenous mir-100 in h295r and sw-13 cells increased protein expression of mtor , raptor , and igf - ir . in order to evaluate the functional consequences of igf - ir inhibition in adrenal carcinomas , barlaskar et al . analyzed a large series of benign and malignant human adrenal tumors and a panel of acc cell lines using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , nvp - aew541 , and a fully human monoclonal antibody anti - igf - ir , imc - a12 , both specifically targeting igf - ir .
treatments with both nvp - aew541 and imc - a12 resulted in inhibition of growth of acc cells in vitro . in xenograft tumors ,
igf - ir blockade was more potent than mitotane , the first - line adrenolytic drug used in patients with acc , and significantly enhanced mitotane response . in vitro
( in h295 and in sw-13 cells ) efficacy of nvp - aew541 treatment was confirmed by other studies [ 177 , 210 ] .
thiazolidinediones ( tzds ) , a class of antidiabetic drugs , have also been investigated as potential therapeutic agents for acc .
tzds are ligands for the peroxisome - proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar)- , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand - dependent transcription factors , that is expressed predominantly in the adipose tissue but also in other tissues , although at much lower levels .
ppar-  exerts a critical role in several biological processes such as adipogenesis , glucose metabolism , inflammation , cell growth , and differentiation .
nowadays , the molecular basis for the antitumor action of ppar-  agonists remains incompletely elucidated .
however , numerous studies support the notion that ppar-  activation induces apoptosis and thus exerts anticancer effects .
although no differences in the expression of ppar-  are seen in normal and tumor tissue , the ppar-  agonist rosiglitazone inhibited growth and invasiveness of h295r cells . indeed , both in sw-13 and h295 acc cells , rosiglitazone inhibited the signaling pathways downstream igf - ir , but not the receptor itself   ( table 2 ) .  
clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of monoclonal antibody imc - a12 , either used as monotherapy or in combination with mitotane ( trials nct00831844 and nct00778817 , resp . ) .
the dual kinase inhibitor of both igf - ir and ir , osi-906 , is currently being evaluated in acc patients ( trial nct00924989 ) ( table 2 ) .
epithelial ovarian cancer ( eoc ) constitutes 90% of ovarian malignancies   and is the most common cause of gynecological cancer - related mortality .
it is fairly common in scandinavia , less common in western europe and north america , and infrequent in the developing countries and in japan .
a first - degree family history of eoc is associated with approximately 3-fold increased risk .
eocs are subdivided into four major categories : high - grade serous ( 70% ) , endometrioid ( 10% ) , clear cell ( 10% ) , mucinous ( 3% ) , and low - grade serous carcinomas ( < 5% ) .
the marked clinical differences in ovarian cancer stage at presentation , response to therapy , and survival are manifestations of a complex underlying molecular heterogeneity of ovarian cancers .
relatively little is known about the basic molecular and cellular mechanism that modulates growth of epithelial ovarian cancer and , presently , there are no available treatments capable of curing recurrent ovarian carcinomas due to their rapid evolution into a chemoresistant disease . in physiology ,
moreover , over the last decade , accumulating data suggest that the insulin / igf pathway might be a promising therapeutic target in ovarian cancer   ( table 1 ) . in 1991 , yee et al .
examined the possibility that the igf system could be important in regulating the autocrine growth of eoc cells .
the expressions of igf - i- , igf - ir- , and igf - binding proteins were studied in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues .
igf - ir mrna was found in ovarian cancer cell lines and the primary or metastatic ovarian cancer tissues .
in ovcar-3 cell line , igf - binding proteins , including igfbp-2 , igfbp-3 and igfbp-4 , were expressed . in epithelial cells derived from untreated , ovarian cancer specimens , exogenous
ovary cancer cell lines also express ir ; elevated levels of ir and insulin binding capacity were present in six cancer cell lines as compared to normal ovarian epithelium cell lines and were associated with mitogenic signaling in response to low doses of insulin .
ir isoform analysis has shown preferential expression of ir - a , suggesting the ability of exogenous igf - ii to stimulate eoc cell proliferation through ir - a   ( table 1 ) .
moreover , studies in nih - ovcar3 cells have shown that igf - i and igfbp-2 promote ovarian cancer cell growth and invasiveness .
igfbp-2 is dramatically increased in the serum and ovarian cyst fluid of women with epithelial ovarian cancer [ 222 , 223 ] and is involved in stimulation of cell growth . in agreement with these data , elevated serum levels of igf - i and igfbp-2 have been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer [ 224 , 225 ] ( table 1 ) .
other studies have shown that igfbp-2 expression level in epithelial ovarian cancers is up to 38-fold higher than in normal ovarian epithelium .
moreover , serum igfbp-2 levels are elevated in women with early- and advanced - stage ovarian cancer as compared to controls and to patients with benign gynecological conditions , indicating that igfbp-2 may be useful as a serum biomarker for detection and monitoring of epithelial ovarian cancer .
although the cellular mechanisms through which igfbp-2 exerts a role in ovarian tumorigenesis are not completely elucidated , experimental data demonstrate that the growth - modulating effects of igfbp-2 in ovarian cancer cells may be mediated by the activation of three specific cascades controlling cell growth , proliferation , and differentiation , that is , extracellular signal - regulated protein kinases ( erks ) , stress - activated protein kinases ( sapks ) or c - jun n - terminal protein kinases ( jnks ) and p38 kinases .
furthermore , it has been seen that igfbp-2 may regulate the expression of several potential cancer - promoting cytokines including fibroblast growth factors 6 and 7 ( fgf-6 and -7 ) , neurotrophin-4 ( nt-4 ) , and placental growth factor ( pigf ) .
thus , although igfbps are potent modulators of the mitogenic effects of igfs , igf - independent actions have also been recognized suggesting that igfbps are a separate class of growth modulators .
igf - ii is also considered a molecular marker and potential therapeutic target for the most aggressive eocs . indeed ,
when compared with normal ovarian surface epithelium samples , ovarian cancers show approximately 300-fold higher expression of the igf - ii gene .
high igf - ii and lower igfbp-3 expression are associated with high - grade , poorly differentiated , and advanced - stage disease [ 227 , 228 ] .
the association between igf - ii expression and ovarian cancer survival is driven by two specific promoters of igf - ii gene .
the igf - ii gene has four promoters , and each initiates a promoter - specific transcript which is expressed in a temporal and spatial - dependent manner .
the transcription of three of the four igf - ii promoters , promoters 2 , 3 , and 4 ( p2 , p3 and p4 ) , is regulated by dna methylation .
dna methylation alterations have been identified as being involved in tumorigenesis and disease progression [ 231 , 232 ] .
using methylation - specific polymerase chain reaction ( msp ) assay   it has been found that the methylation pattern of p2 and p3 igf - ii promoters as well as the levels of igf - ii mrna and peptide was significantly different among patients with distinct tumor grade , residual tumor size , and treatment response .
patients with methylated p2 and unmethylated p3 ( p2m / p3u ) had 5 times higher mrna expression and nearly 2-fold higher peptide levels compared to those with opposite pattern of methylation ( p2u / p3 m ) .
recently , genetic variations across the igf components have been correlated with ovarian cancer risk [ 119 , 120 ] . in primary ovarian cancer tissue , using microarray technology , spentzos et al .
studying sixty - four patients with advanced stages of eoc , they found that expression patterns of igf axis genes have prognostic significance in this highly lethal disease .
however , components of the igf - i pathway were found overexpressed also in low - grade tumors , which respond to treatment with exogenous igf - i with increased proliferation and migration .
early data have shown that phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ( s - odns )   inhibit the function of the igf - ir in nih - ovcar3 ovarian cancer cells and suppress cancer cell growth in vitro , but have small effects in vivo . in the same cell model , a neutralizing antibody to igfbp-2 also inhibits cell growth and downregulates the expression of a number of potential cancer - promoting cytokines .
more recently , it has been shown that nvp - aew541 , an igf - ir tyrosine kinase inhibitor , is able to inhibit growth in eoc cell lines , ovcar-3 and ovcar-4 , and to sensitize cells to cisplatin   ( table 2 ) . today
, at least five ongoing clinical trials aim to target the igf - i axis in eoc patients .
a phase ii trial is currently investigating the fully human anti - igf - ir monoclonal antibody amg 479 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin ( nct00718523 ) .
another phase ii trial is examining amg 479 in recurrent platinum - sensitive ovarian cancer ( nct00719212 ) ( table 2 ) .
the combination between amg 479 and amg 655 ( an human anti - dr5 monoclonal antibody ) is the object of a study ( phase i / ii study ) in patients with eoc and other advanced , refractory solid tumors ( nct00819169 ) .
a phase i / ii trial is currently evaluating intermittent and continuous osi-906 , in combination with weekly paclitaxel , in patients with recurrent eocs or other solid tumors ( nct00889382 ) .
another phase i trial ( nct01322802 ) is testing the safety and immunogenicity of a dna - plasmid - based vaccine encoding the amino acids 1163 of igfbp-2 in patients with advanced eoc .
recently , an alternative therapeutical approach using insulin sensitizers , such as metformin , has been suggested against ovarian cancer .
the rationale for using these drugs comes from evidence that a combination therapy with metformin and ly294002 , an inhibitor of pi3k , reduces growth and induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells   by inhibiting pi3k / akt and mtor   while activating the ampk / acc pathway . in agreement with these preclinical data
, an epidemiologic study conducted in 341 patients with eoc has shown that patients with t2 dm who used metformin had longer progression - free survival than nonusers , despite receiving similar treatment for ovarian cancer .
a close relationship is now established between the use of metformin and progression , survival , and chemosensitivity of eoc [ 237240 ] ( table 2 ) .
recently , a phase ii clinical trial ( nct01579812 ) started to establish the potential role of metformin as anticancer stem cell agent in eoc patients .
the primary objective of this study is to determine if metformin , administered as the time of traditional adjuvant chemotherapy to women with advanced eoc , will improve recurrence - free survival at 18 months compared to controls ( table 2 ) .
advanced endocrine tumors are characterized by poor prognosis and resistance to the common dna - damaging chemotherapies or radiotherapy .
most extensively characterized endocrine malignancies include thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian cancers . in these tumors ,
a crosstalk between the igf system and the pituitary hormones specific for each endocrine gland has been recognized and seems to exert a role in the tumorigenesis process .
recently , the risk of certain malignancies , including endocrine related cancers , has been found 2 - 3-fold increased in obese and t2 dm patients .
insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia , typical features of both obesity and diabetes , are the major candidates for cancer risk and are also associated with poor cancer prognosis and resistance to conventional and targeted anticancer therapies .
multiple alterations in the igf system as well as association with high circulating levels of insulin / igfs have been reported by several studies for these three endocrine cancer histotypes .
however , the potential role of the igf system as therapeutical target in these tumors has being only recently evaluated and few clinical trials are currently ongoing . today
the therapeutical strategies proposed to overcome igf axis alterations in these malignancies include igf - ir blocking antibodies , igf - ir / ir tyrosine - kinase inhibitors , and insulin sensitizers .
so far , preclinical results obtained with the first two classes of drugs mentioned above have shown promising hopes although the results are not conclusive and no complete responses have been reported .
furthermore , like in other malignancies , the development of intrinsic and adaptative resistance to igf axis blockage could occur .
aberrant ir expression , particularly ir - a isoform , as well as hr - a formation and enhanced igf - ii autocrine production are very common alterations in endocrine cancers and could mediate the resistance to igf - ir blocking drugs . furthermore , insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are side effects of these drugs and may contribute to ir - a overactivation .
new approaches aimed at specifically and safely targeting ir - a activation and/or disrupting the autocrine igf - ii / ir - a loop are urgently needed . in light of lines of evidence of association of endocrine cancers risk and hyperinsulinemia , insulin - sensitizers , such as metformin , hold promise as measures useful in cancer prevention .","1.

"before discovery of an effective vaccine , haemophilus influenzae type b ( hib ) was the most important cause of bacterial meningitis , otitis media , pneumonia , cellulitis , bacteremia , and septic arthritis in infants and children younger than five years ( 1 , 2 ) .
it is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world , with as many as 3 million cases of serious disease occurring every year .
the hib capsule is its major virulence factor , and is composed of a polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ( prp ) that can induce protective and effective immunity ( 3 ) .
hib prp is a polymer of repeating monomeric units , structurally characterized as -d - ribose - d - ribitol - phosphate ( 4 , 5 ) .
the first generation of vaccines for hib was licensed in the united states in 1985 , based on purified capsular polysaccharide ( 6 ) .
this type of vaccine stimulates a t cell - independent immune response and prevents hib infections in children older than 2 years , but it does not protect infants ( 7 ) . since about 75% of hib infection cases occur in children younger than 2 years , second - generation hib vaccines , which induced t - cell dependent immune responses , were produced as prp - protein conjugates and licensed in the united states in 1987 ( 8) .
the price of the conjugated prp vaccine is high ( 9 ) , and therefore a major challenge in hib vaccine production is to develop a cost - efficient vaccine . to enhance biomass and prp productions ,
most previous studies have focused on hib cultivation with respect to essential chemical , biochemical , and physical factors such as ph , dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , aeration , temperature , and agitation ( 10 - 12 ) .
most of these studies employed single factors or multiple factors by changing one variable at a time , while keeping the others at a constant level .
however , such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors .
therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm ) to examine the main and/or interactive effects of a factorial combination of ph , temperature , and agitation treatment factors on the growth of hib and biomass production .
response surface methodology enabled the identification of optimum levels of growth factors in maximizing hib biomass , and more prp production as a direct result ( 10 , 13 ) .
response surface methodology guides the plan of the experiments and the parsimonious analysis of data to gain a maximum amount of information most efficiently ( 14 , 15 ) .
a strain of haemophilus influenzae type b , atcc 10211 , was used in all the experiments .
the culture medium was prepared according to the method explained by maitre - wilmotte et al .
it had 5 mg of -nad ( sigma , germany ) , 0.015 g of protoporphyrin ix ( sigma , germany ) , 20 g of glucose ( merck , germany ) , 5 g of dialyzed yeast extract ( sigma , germany ) , 70 mg of cysteine ( sigma , germany ) , 10 g of bactopepton ( difco , usa ) , 20 mg of tryptophan ( sigma , germany ) , 31.14 g of na2hpo4 .12h2o ( sigma , germany ) , 2.03 g of nah2po4.2h2o ( sigma , germany ) , 1 g of ( nh4)2so4 ( sigma , germany ) , 0.4 g of mgso4.7h2o ( sigma , germany ) , and 0.02 g of cacl2.2h2o ( sigma , germany ) . all material was dissolved in de - ionized water to a final volume of 1 l , and the medium was filtered in a 0.8 m ( millipore , canada ) membrane .
fifty ml of the culture medium was distributed to a non - baffled 250 ml erlenmeyer and autoclaved at 121 c for 30 minutes .
glucose , nad , and protoporphyrin were sterilized separately by filtration with 0.22 m ( millipore , canada ) membranes , and transferred to experimental flasks .
the preparation of the working seed and inoculation of experimental culture flasks were done according to the methods explained by merritt et al . ( 11 ) .
a deep frozen 1 ml vial of hib in 15% glycerol was thawed and transferred to two chocolate agar - slant tubes , then incubated at 37 c for 18 hours .
the surface grown bacteria were harvested and re - suspended in 2 ml of the culture medium , and transferred to a 500 ml erlenmeyer with 200 ml fresh culture medium .
it was then incubated at 300 rpm in a shaker incubator at 37 c , for 6 - 8 hours
. 5 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 45 ml of the culture medium in each of 250 ml experimental flasks .
the temperature , agitation , and ph of each experimental flask were adjusted to the designed point .
the amount of dry cell weight ( dcw ) was determined by dry - weight measurement .
after the cultivation period , each cultured medium was heat - deactivated at 60 c for 30 minutes and centrifuged at 3200 g , at 4 c for 60 minutes in pre - weighed tubes .
the supernatant was saved for a prp assay in the next steps , and the pellets were re - suspended in 0.15 m nacl and centrifuged again .
the supernatant was discarded and each tube containing the cell mass was dried at 60 c for 24 h and weighed to get the dry cell weight ( 17 ) . in this research ,
the effects of three continuous treatment factors ( temperature , agitation and initial ph of culture medium ) on the hib growth were examined to find their optimum , lower , and upper values in maximizing hib biomass and prp production .
we used a central composite design consisting of a factorial treatment structure , including a total number of treatment combinations n = 2 + 2k + n0 .
k is the number of treatment factors , n0 is the number of replicates of treatment combinations at the center ( n0 > 1 ) , and 2 is the number of axial points of the axis of each treatment factor , at a distance of  (  = 2 ) from the design center ( 18 , 19 ) .
we used three treatment factors : temperature , initial ph of medium , and agitation ( k = 3 ) , six replicates of the center point combination ( n0 = 6 ) , six star points , and  = 1.682 .
study type : response surface ; initial design : central composite ; design model : quadratic ; runs : 20 . after an incubation period of 18 h for each test ,
dcw data were then fitted using a second - order polynomial regression model that included an intercept and the three explanatory variables , plus their 2 and 3 way interactions .
the full model considered was : where y = the predicted mean of hib dry biomass . to illustrate the relationships between experimental and predicted values ,
design - expert software ( version 7 , stat - ease inc . , minneapolis , usa ) was used to set up the design and analyze the data .
a strain of haemophilus influenzae type b , atcc 10211 , was used in all the experiments .

dcw data were then fitted using a second - order polynomial regression model that included an intercept and the three explanatory variables , plus their 2 and 3 way interactions .
the full model considered was : where y = the predicted mean of hib dry biomass .
to illustrate the relationships between experimental and predicted values , the response surface plots were shown .
design - expert software ( version 7 , stat - ease inc . , minneapolis , usa ) was used to set up the design and analyze the data .
the best fitting response surface model was 2 factor interactions ( 2fi ) with the equation : y is the predicted dcw of hib biomass by the model . however , the parameter estimates ( coefficients ) were significant only for agitation , temperature , ph , and temperature by ph interaction ( table 3 ) .
after removal of the ineffective parameter interactions , the final reduced equation was : was : the fitness of the model was evaluated based on 1 ) non - significant lack of fit test , 2 ) reasonable and significant r values ( table 3 ) , close agreement of measured versus predicted mean biomass ( table 4 and figure 1 ) .
the above polynomial model is expressed as 3-dimentional response surface graphs , indicating the maximum dcw values and the optimum values of the related explanatory variables .
the optimum values of the three treatment factors were agitation 250 rpm , temperature 35 c , and initial ph 8.5 .
table 4 shows the actual hib dcw values measured based on the experiments and those values predicted by the rsm model .

table 4 shows the actual hib dcw values measured based on the experiments and those values predicted by the rsm model .
with reference to anova data ( table 3 ) , the ph of culture medium and temperature of incubation are very effective factors in the growth of hib ( p - value equal or < 0.0001 ) .
takagi et al . ( 10 ) obtained about 4300 mg / l dcw of hib ( strain gb 3291 ) in a fermentor with overlay aeration , and 4900 mg / l dcw with 10% air saturated dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , without ph control , and proposed that hib biomass production is better at low dissolved oxygen if ph is not controlled . under our study s conditions , the experiments were carried out in shaking flasks without air - sparged and uncontrolled ph , and we obtained about 5471 mg / l dcw of hib biomass , after optimization of treatment factors by rsm .
figure 2 and 3 illustrate the 3-d response surfaces that show the effects of temperature and ph .
hib biomass production increased considerably when initial ph increased from 6 to 8.5 and temperature decreased to 35c .
when initial ph was less than the optimum point and tended towards 6 , and agitation had fallen toward minimum values ( about 100 ) , hib biomass production decreased parallel to decreasing temperature , from 39 to 35c . at higher values of agitation ( over 200 rpm ) , there was no significant difference between the amounts of hib biomass produced at temperatures from 35c to 39c .
however , when the initial ph was 8.5 , decreasing incubation temperature from 39c to 35c led to substantially increased hib biomass . despite the extensive studies that have been done on hib , published studies on hib cultivation are rare ( 9 , 10 ) , especially on the statistical optimization of physical and chemical factors affecting growth and bulk production of hib biomass . over the past years there has been only one published article using a reliable statistical method ( plackett - burman design ) for optimization of hib culture medium components ( 12 ) .
nevertheless , takagi and her colleagues published several very valuable articles on improvement and characterization of hib prp production ( 9 , 10 , 13 , 17 ) .
also we found that by using statistical methods like rsm and ccd to sketch an optimization plan , there will be a huge savings in the number and type of essential experiments , materials , time , depreciation of equipment and devices , human resources and specialists , and consumed energy , that will finally result in a lower overall price of the vaccine .
hib biomass production was greatly influenced by ph and incubation temperature of cultured media . therefore
, optimization of the growth factors to maximize hib production can lead to 1 ) increased bacterial biomass and prp productions , 2 ) lower vaccine prices , 3 ) vaccination of more susceptible populations , and 4 ) lower risk of hib infections .
with reference to anova data ( table 3 ) , the ph of culture medium and temperature of incubation are very effective factors in the growth of hib ( p - value equal or < 0.0001 ) .
takagi et al . ( 10 ) obtained about 4300 mg / l dcw of hib ( strain gb 3291 ) in a fermentor with overlay aeration , and 4900 mg / l dcw with 10% air saturated dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , without ph control , and proposed that hib biomass production is better at low dissolved oxygen if ph is not controlled . under our study s conditions , the experiments were carried out in shaking flasks without air - sparged and uncontrolled ph , and we obtained about 5471 mg / l dcw of hib biomass , after optimization of treatment factors by rsm .

"eruption is the axial or occlusal movement of the tooth from its developmental position within the jaw to its functional position in the occlusal plane .
the common and important reasons attributed to delayed eruption are usually insufficient space , early loss of primary teeth with eventual closure of space , crowding of arches and rotation of tooth buds .
excessive fibrous tissue over an erupting tooth is also one of the most common causes , with eruption cysts being relatively rare .
complete lack of eruptive force can be the reason for unerupted tooth when the normal number of teeth is present radiographically , although this is debatable , since few workers have debunked this claim .
syndromes , metabolic , and hormonal disorders are also other causes of multiple impacted permanent teeth . finally crowding and rotation of tooth buds can also lead to impacted teeth .
the objective of the study is to increase awareness of cases of multiple unerupted teeth in which multiple etiologies need to be discussed and investigated .
a 17-year - old male patient reported with a chief complaint of multiple missing teeth and compromized esthetics .
he had no relevant family history and this was his first dental visit . on further enquiry the patient revealed that he had loss of deciduous teeth with no eruption of permanent teeth . on examination ,
the patient had multiple retained deciduous teeth with only the permanent maxillary central and lateral incisors , mandibular central incisors , right maxillary first molar and left mandibular first molar present .
the incisal length of the maxillary central incisors appeared reduced ( partial eruption ) and the patient had a high arched palate [ figure 1 ] .
high arched palate along with reduced incisal length is also visible the patient was advised opg , chest x - ray and skull x - ray .
opg revealed the presence of impacted , unerupted , and missing permanent teeth [ figure 2 , table 1 ] .
skull and chest x - rays did not reveal any other obvious deformities [ figure 3 ] .
panaromic radiograph of patient showing retained deciduous teeth and multiple impacted permanent teeth missing , unerupted , and impacted teeth skull and chest xrays which do not reveal any obvious deformities the patient did not report for investigations and was unresponsive .
multiple impactions are seen rarely and are usually associated with systemic conditions . guided eruption of many teeth with the help of coordinated multidisciplinary management
there are numerous eruption - regulating molecules having similar and overlapping functions , which ensures that even the absence of a single factor does not interrupt the event of eruption . but
egf , egf - r , csf-1 , csf-1r , il-1 , il-1r , c - fos , nfb , mcp-1 , tgf-1 , pthrp , cbfa - l ( now called runx2 ) , opg , rank / rankl are the major tooth eruption molecules .
stellate reticulum is the site for few molecules with the majority of the eruption molecules residing in the dental follicle . while most eruption defects are part of a genetic syndrome , they can also be nonfamilial , as in the case in primary failure of eruption ( pfe ) . in pfe localized failure of eruption of
candidate genes for primary failure of eruption would be the molecules that function solely in the pre - eruptive phase and that are expressed in cells of the dental follicle and surrounding structures .
hence , it is likely that genes like csf-1 , nfb , and c - fos are the genes responsible for the eruption defect .
common reasons like lack of space , prolonged retention or early loss of deciduous tooth , abnormal position of tooth bud , presence of alveolar cleft , ankylosis , cystic or neoplastic formation , alveolar or dental trauma , and dilacerations of teeth falling into the localized category .
the differential diagnoses in case of syndromes are cleidocranial dysostosis , gardners syndrome , gorlin  sedano syndrome , and yunis  varon syndrome . in the case of cleidocranial dysplasia
the patients usually exhibit high - arched palate with prolonged retention of the deciduous teeth leading to subsequent delay in eruption of the deciduous teeth .
though both the intraoral features were present in our case the abnormalities of skull and shoulder girdle along with multiple supernumerary impacted teeth were absent .
gardner 's syndrome that also presents with multiple impacted teeth was ruled out as associated signs like multiple epidermoid cysts and other lesions were absent .
sedano syndrome represents as short hands , foot bones with short and straight collar bone along with multiple impacted teeth .
features of yunis  varon syndrome are agenesis or hypoplasia of clavicle , severe micrognathia , digital anomalies , hypodontia , spinal defects , and impacted teeth .
both the syndromes presented with multiple impacted teeth but were ruled out from our case as other symptoms were not present . in the case of hormonal disorders hypothyroidism , hypoparathyroidism , and pseudo hypoparathyrodism are to be considered .
estimation of t3 , t4 , and tsh is required for diagnosing hypothyrodism where there is low serum t4 and elevated tsh .
evaluation of total serum calcium concentration and serum parathyroid hormone is required for hypoparathyrodism and pseudohypoparathyroidism .
there is decrease of serum calcium in both and elevation of parathyroid hormone in pseudo hypoparathyroidism and decrease of hormone in hypoparathyrodism .
metabolic disorders like vitamin d deficiency rickets are also associated with impacted teeth . in our case ,
failure of eruption could also be due to crowding of supernumerary teeth but in our case that was not observed . in this case ,
the medical and family histories along with extraoral examination were not suggestive of any syndrome or metabolic disorder . only a few cases of nonsyndrome multiple impacted teeth were reported.[913 ] in those studies the predominant explanation was that some physical barrier led to impaction and noneruption of teeth .
duration and results of treatment in less frequent cases of multiple impactions is a major concern when compared to more frequent single impaction cases .
multidisciplinary approach would be the appropriate choice as treatment involves esthetics , functional , and oral health problems . in case of unerupted teeth ,
orthodontic extrusions may be attempted . in view of the pathological potential of the impacted teeth , surgical removal is recommended .
rehabilitation of the patient with fixed dentures needs to be planned with the help of a prosthdontist and implantologist .
obtaining stable results along with enhanced esthetics , oral health , and function would be the objective of the treatment .
hypodontia and eruption problems are mainly focused on genes such as csf  1 , nfb , and c - fos .
radiographs reveal the presence of multiple impacted teeth but additional investigations are needed to rule out systemic and metabolic conditions . a decision about the management
since the patient was regrettably lost to follow - up , genetic , and other studies could not be performed .
. therefore , an idiopathic case of multiple impacted teeth could be the only possible diagnosis , since the term idiopathic refers to unknown cause , which is the case in this particular scenario .","INTRODUCTION

"diabetes mellitus is a syndrome characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and associated with absolute or relative deficiency in insulin secretion or insulin action .
herbal medicine has been used as an antidiabetic therapy alone , along with insulin or other synthetic oral hypoglycemic agents .
the use of synthetic agents is frequently associated with several undesirable side effects and fails to correct the fundamental biochemical lesion and diabetic complications .
the search for a cure for diabetes mellitus continues along with traditional and alternative medicine .
many herbal supplements have been used for the treatment of diabetes , but the scientific evidence to support their effectiveness has only been investigated for a few . to suppress the oxidative stress mediated damage in diabetic pathophysiology , researchers usually look for naturally occurring antioxidants [ 4 , 5 ] .
chronic hyperglycemia resulting from diabetes brings about a rise in oxidative stress due to overproduction of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) as a result of glucose - autoxidation and protein glycosylation .
generation of ros leads to oxidative damage of the structural components ( such as lipids , dna and proteins ) of cells which culminate into complications affecting the eyes , kidney , nerves , and blood vessels .
oxidative insult in cells is also created by the impairment in functioning of endogenous antioxidant enzymes because of nonenzymatic glycosylation and oxidation . 

aegle marmelos is a medium - sized deciduous tree found in dry forests and is also cultivated throughout india .
aqueous leaf extract of aegle marmelos has been shown to improve the functional state of pancreatic cells in streptozotocin - induced diabetic rats .
antihyperglycaemic activity of aegle marmelos is reported for leaf extract in glucose fed hyperglycaemic rats .
oral administration of leaves of plant at 5  g / day significantly ameliorates blood glucose level in non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients .
its leaf extract has been observed to produce antihyperglycaemic activity in streptozotocin diabetic rats without altered serum cortisol level .
the plant exerts its pharmacological activity independent of its time of administration , that is , either prior to or after streptozotocin administration .
murraya koenigii leaves extract is considered extensively as antidiabetic agent and as a spice and condiment in india and other tropical countries .
feeding different doses of murraya koenigii leaves to diabetic rats plays a role in control of mild diabetes but in case of moderate , severe , and type i diabetes , this agent alone is not likely to be useful .
murraya koenigii leaf extract significantly decreased the level of blood glucose in experimental diabetic rats . 

ocimum sanctum is an annual tropical herb grown all over india and used in household remediation .
alcoholic extract of leaves significantly lowered the blood glucose in normal and alloxan diabetic rats .
syzygium cumini is distributed throughout india and indian folk medicine is replete with its use for the treatment of diabetes .
traditionally in indian medicinal system , it is always found that composite extract is the most effective compared to single plant extract .
the present study aims to study the potent antidiabetic activity of composite extract ( ce ) of aegle marmelos , azadirachta indica , murraya koenigii , ocimum sanctum leafs , and syzygium cumini fruits in alloxan - induced diabetic rats comparing the effect with insulin .
n - acetylneuraminic acid ( nana ) , resorcinol , and chloramine - t were purchased from sigma aldrich , india .
all other chemicals were of highest purity , available from merck , india , and himedia labs , india . 

aegle marmelos , azadirachta indica , murraya koenigii , and ocimum sanctum were collected from sam higginbottom institute of agriculture , technology & sciences orchard , whereas syzygium cumini fruits were collected from a local market in allahabad .
the collected plants leaves and fruits were dried at room temperature , pulverized by a mechanical grinder , and sieved through 40 mesh .
the fine powder of leaves and fruits was extracted with 80% methanol using a soxhlet at boiling temperature ( 60c ) up to 10  h separately ; a dark green coloured extract was obtained for aegle marmelos , azadirachta indica , murraya koenigii , and ocimum sanctum leaves whereas the extract obtained from syzygium cumini fruits was dark brown in colour .
the obtained extract was collected in air tight dark bottle separately and stored at 4c until time of use .
the extracts of all plants were diluted in water on the day of experiment and administered by oral gavage at dose of 25  mg , 50  mg , and 100  mg / kg body weight ( all doses contain same concentration ratio of all extracts ) in a fixed volume of 1  ml .
the rats were injected with alloxan monohydrate ( 2,4,5,6-tetraoxyprimidine ) dissolved in sterile 0.9% normal saline at a dose of 150  mg / kg body weight intraperitoneally [ 18 , 19 ] .
since experimentally alloxan is capable of inducing insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( iddm ) ( which destroys pancreatic -cells and induces type 1 diabetes ) , the rats were then kept for the next 24  h on 5% glucose solution bottles in their cage to prevent hypoglycaemia .
after one week , diabetic condition was confirmed through measurement of fasting blood glucose level .
the experiment was carried out with 36 male wistar rats ( 4  0.5 months old ) with body weight in the range 150  15  g. they were housed in a temperature controlled facility ( 25  5c ) with 12  h light - dark cycle for at least 1 week .
all rats were fed with a normal laboratory diet of nutrient rich pellets containing total energy as fat , protein and carbohydrates and had free access to drinking water .
after the stabilization period of one week , the rats were randomly divided into six groups , containing six animals in each group ( n = 6 ) : group i : control : receiving no treatment / supplementation ; group ii : induced diabetes : rats were injected single dose intraperitoneally of alloxan [ 18 , 19 ] ; group iii : diabetic insulin group was treated twice a day by subcutaneous injection of three units of nph insulin ( nph huminsulin , lilly egypt ) ; groups iv , v , and vi : rats were administered daily composite extract ( 25  mg / kg , 50  mg / kg , and 100  mg / kg body weight , resp . ) via gavage technique ( oral route ) up to 35 days .
after the end of the treatment period , rats were sacrificed under light anaesthesia ( chloroform ) .
blood was collected by cardiac puncture into 10 unit / ml heparin rinsed anticoagulant syringes ( for the collection of serum no anticoagulant was used ) , and then red blood cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 800  g for 10  min at 4c . separated plasma and serum were immediately frozen at 80c until use for biochemical assay .
all protocols for experiments were approved by the animal care and ethics committee of university of allahabad .
determination of aopp levels was performed by modification of the method of witko - sarsat .
two  ml of plasma was diluted 1  :  5 in pbs : 0.1  ml of 1.16  m potassium iodide was then added to each tube , followed by 0.2  ml acetic acid after 2  min .
the absorbance of the reaction mixture was immediately read at 340  nm against a blank containing 2  ml of pbs , 0.1  ml of ki , and 0.2  ml of acetic acid .
the chloramine - t absorbance at 340  nm being linear within the range of 0 to 100  mmol / l , aopp concentrations were expressed as moll chloramine - t equivalents .
it was performed by the method proposed by spyridaki and siskos . to determine the sialic acid level in plasma
, 0.10  ml of 0.04  m periodic acid was added to a glass tube containing 500  l diluted ( 20 times ) sample solution .
it was mixed thoroughly and allowed to stand in ice bath for 30  min .
thereafter , 1.25  ml of resorcinol working solution ( 5  ml of 6.0% resorcinol solution , 0.125  ml of 0.1  m copper sulphate solution , and 19.875  ml of distilled water , brought to a final volume of 50  ml with 10  m hcl ) was added , mixed and heated at 98c for 5  min .
the solutions were mixed , vigorously and the tubes were placed in a water bath at 37c for 3  min for colour to stabilize . immediately after removing the solutions from the water bath their absorbance was measured at 625  nm against a reagent blank .
a calibration graph was prepared with standard solutions of nana in the range 20200  m and the unknown concentrations of total sialic acid in samples were calculated .
blood glucose level was measured by glucometer ( glucocare ultima ) , total cholesterol and triglycerides were estimated by enzymatic method , hdl was assayed by phosphotungstic acid method using reagent kit procedural guideline and detail ( erba diagnostics mannheim , germany ) .
surat , india ) , free fatty acid was measured by duncombe , and alkaline phosphatase was assayed by method of moss et al . .
statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version 5.00 for windows , graphpad software , san diego , california , usa .
for statistical analysis of the data group means and were compared by one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by tukey 's multiple comparison test .
the dose - dependent effects of composite extract ( ce ) on blood glucose in normal and experimental rats are shown in figure 1 .
the blood glucose was significantly elevated in diabetic rats as compared to normal control rats .
oral administration of ce at 25 , 50 , and 100  mg  kg body weight significantly lowered the blood glucose level as compared to untreated and insulin treated diabetic rats .
ce at a dose of 100  mg  kg body weight restored the blood glucose to normal levels .
the level of advance oxidation protein product ( aopp ) in plasma was significantly increased in alloxan - induced diabetic rats when compared to normal control rats .
administration of ce offered significant reduction in the level of aopp level in diabetic rats ( figure 2 ) .
ce at a dose of 100  mg  kg body weight tried to maintain aopp plasma level near to the normal rats .
the extract showed a mild sialic acid lowering effect in nondiabetic rats , while the levels of the plasma sialic content were significantly increased in diabetic rats .
the composite extract treated diabetic rats have shown a significant retrieval in the levels of sialic acid in the plasma level as shown in figure 3 composite extract treated diabetic animals displayed significant reduction towards nondiabetic levels .
the change in the level of serum lipid profile in control and experimental rats is illustrated in figure 4 .
except for hdl , total cholesterol , triglyceride , ldl , and vldl significantly increased in alloxan - induced diabetic rats when compared with the normal control rats .
oral administration of ce offered significant decrease in total cholesterol , triglyceride , ldl , and vldl and also increase in the hdl level in diabetic rats .
ce at a dose of 100  mg  kg body weight and also insulin restored serum lipids approximately to the normal level but serum hdl level significantly increased despite ce treatment .
the level of creatinine was significantly higher in diabetic rats as compared to normal rats .
the oral dose of ce 25 , 50 , and 100  mg  kg body weight decreases the creatinine level , respectively ; the effect of ce was dose dependent .
serum free fatty acid was significantly higher in diabetic rats as compared to normal rats .
oral administration of ce lowered the serum free fatty acid as compared to untreated diabetic rats .
the level of alkaline phosphatase in serum was significantly increased in alloxan - induced diabetic rats when compared to normal control rats .
administration of ce offered significant reduction in the level of alkaline phosphatase in diabetic rats .
ce at a dose of 100  mg  kg body weight restored the alkaline phosphatase level near to the normal level compared to normal rats ( figure 7 ) .
many of the individual ingredients ( used in the present study ) of this polyherbal product have been shown to have hypoglycemic effect in earlier studies [ 3 , 11 ] .
individually all plants used in the study contain medicinal ingredients which have been shown to elicit hypoglycaemic effect in diabetic rats , albeit in a large dose [ 9 , 27 ] .
previous studies have revealed that the combined extract of e. jambolana ( seeds ) and a. marmelos ( leaves ) produces hypoglycaemic effect by increasing serum insulin levels and decreasing serum lipid levels ; this effect is attributed to the synergistic effect of the combined plant extracts . a study has also revealed that the o. sanctum leaf extracts have stimulatory effects on physiological pathways of insulin secretion which may underlie its reported antidiabetic action . in case of azadirachta indica
leaves the probable case of reduction of blood glucose level might be due to increased peripheral uptake of glucose and increased sensitivity of insulin receptors   and also in case of m. koenigii the reduced blood glucose level could result due to delayed absorption of the glucose from the gastrointestinal tract .
continuous treatment for 35 days with the ce ( 100  mg  kg body weight ) caused a significant decrease in the blood glucose level of diabetic rats ( figure 1 ) .
this is an interesting observation , as the continuous use of the extract or the accidental overdose of ce will not result in hypoglycaemic shock .
since proteins have varied biological functions , there are often unique functional consequences resulting from their modification .
it is estimated that almost every third protein in a cell of older animals is dysfunctional as enzyme or structural protein due to oxidative damage .
oxidative modulation of proteins due to reduced radical scavenging activity of plasma patients may be one of the reasons of altered physiological processes in type 2 diabetic patients .
therefore , the measurement of the protein oxidation is a clinically important factor for the prediction of the diabetes or degree of oxidative stress in diabetes and stress - related diseases
. advanced protein oxidation products ( aopp ) are defined as dityrosine containing crosslinked protein products due to action of chloraminated oxidants , mainly hypochlorous acid and chloramines , produced by myeloperoxidase in activated neutrophils .
oxidation of proteins can lead to a whole variety of amino acid modifications ; it may be selective and specific .
accumulation of protein products is associated with a number of diseases , including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , alzheimer 's disease , respiratory distress syndrome , muscular dystrophy , and rheumatoid arthritis .
a few recent studies have shown that the value of aopp is modulated during aging in animals , providing an efficient additional correlation between oxidative stress and aging .
the present study showed that ce is as effective as insulin in decreasing the levels of aopp value and blood glucose level in alloxan diabetic rats ( figure 2 ) .
rbcs are highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to the high cell concentration of oxygen and haemoglobin , a powerful promoter of the oxidative process .
we present evidence ( figure 3 ) to show increased plasma sialic acid in diabetic rats ; ce treatment restored sialic acid to normal level .
the increased plasma sialic acid is also an indicator of oxidative stress during diabetic condition .
it has recently been reported that plasma sialic acid level is increased during aging process which is strongly correlated with oxidative stress .
the level of serum lipids is usually elevated in diabetes which represents a high risk factor for coronary heart disease . under normal condition
however , in a diabetic state , lipoprotein lipase is not activated in sufficient amount due to insulin deficiency resulting in hypertriglyceridemia . the treatment with ce doses 25  mg , 50  mg , and 100  mg / kg of body weight led to significant decrease in total cholesterol , triglyceride , ldl and vldl levels and increase in the level of hdl ( figure 4 ) .
the high prevalence of vascular complications was associated with age , bmi , and triglyceride of diabetic patients .
effort to treat triglyceride appropriately among elderly diabetic patients could be considered as a prime target .
the regression of the diabetic state on ce administration increases the utilization of glucose , thereby depressing the mobilization of fat ( figure 6 ) .
increased levels of these enzymes together with alp and acp are reported to be associated with liver dysfunction and leakage into blood stream in diabetes shown figure 7 .
negative nitrogen balance with enhanced tissue proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis can contribute to enhanced serum urea and creatinine levels ( figure 5 ) , indicating impaired renal functions in diabetic animals .
the effect of ce at a dose of 100  mg  kg body weight restored all the deranged parameters in alloxan - induced rats to normal levels .
in conclusion we show that the ce is a viable treatment strategy for maintenance of diabetic condition including oxidative stress . in its antidiabetic effect ,
ce is better than a large single extract dose because the different active compounds in ce probably act synergistically to exert their action through different mechanisms providing better protection against diabetic condition and its associated complications .","1. Introduction

"infection is a common cause of stillbirth , although its incidence varies greatly with gestational age and between developed and developing countries . in an earlier study by our group ,
, stillbirth is currently defined as ante- or intrapartum death from the 22nd week of pregnancy ; its incidence is reported to be 5.3 per 1,000 live births .  
different infectious agents are widely presumed to produce distinct patterns of inflammation in the placenta .
more specifically , bacterial infections are associated with acute inflammation of the placental membranes , notably acute chorioamnionitis ( cam ) , whereas in viral infections chronic inflammation of the placental parenchyma ( chronic villitis ) is described [ 35 ] .
chronic inflammation in the placenta is primarily directed at the villous parenchyma , that is , villitis with little or no involvement of membranes or vessels .
it is seen in connection with viral infections or , alternatively , as villitis of unknown etiology with a presumed immunological background [ 37 ] .
chronic villitis has been linked to intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr ) in several studies [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] , although its eventual association with stillbirth has not been adequately investigated .
most previous studies investigating cam in stillbirth have compared term and preterm stillborn placentas with placentas from term healthy liveborns , disregarding the multifaceted differences between preterm and term period , not the least concerning the pathophysiology of placenta .
moreover , few studies have addressed the issue of cam and villitis in the same stillborn and control placental material .
the aims of this study were to elucidate differences in the frequency and severity of cam and villitis in placentas from stillborn neonates compared with liveborn controls at term and to evaluate other risk factors and placental findings in the study group .
placentas from stillborn deliveries were prospectively collected between march 2002 and december 2005 at all delivery units in stockholm , sweden .
forty - three cases were excluded because of twin pregnancy ( n = 23 ) or because the placenta was not sent to the pathology department ( n = 20 ) . as controls , we recruited the first term liveborn infant subsequent to the stillborn case , born in the same delivery ward independent of delivery method .
were born on the same day in 89% of cases . in the present study ,
we included only placentas from term singleton pregnancies ( n = 126 cases and n = 273 controls ) .
since 1998 , data from all cases of stillbirth in stockholm have been collected in a database ( http://www.iufd.se ) .
a group of obstetricians representing all delivery wards in stockholm and perinatal pathologists has regularly performed clinical audits of all stillbirths in the area .
all cases of stillbirth in the major stockholm area are investigated according to a consensus , structured test protocol validated in an earlier study .
the protocol includes maternal blood tests ( i.e. , hemoglobin concentration ( hb ) , coagulation tests , etc . ) and some immunological tests , together with culture from the amnion and fetal heart blood , pcr analysis for cytomegalovirus , parvovirus b19 , and enterovirus in placenta , chromosomal analysis in amnion or placenta , placental examination , and autopsy .
the results together with relevant family , medical , and obstetrical history are registered in the database .
the most common causes ( definite or probable ) in the 126 term cases presented in this study were identified as infections ( 25% ) , placental insufficiency / intrauterine growth restriction ( 13% ) , umbilical cord complications ( 7% ) , and placental abruption ( 6% ) . during the study period we also used the database to collect information on the controls , including relevant family , medical , and obstetric history as well as the infant 's birth weight .
small for gestational age ( sga ) was defined ( using the standard definition for sga in sweden ) as birth weight < 2 standard deviations below mean .
maternal blood tests , culture samples , and pcr analyses of the placenta were not routinely performed in the controls .
the study was approved by the regional ethics committee of the karolinska institutet in stockholm , sweden ( no .
all placentas were sent to the department of pathology at karolinska university hospital , huddinge .
this design was specifically chosen in order to avoid the well - documented interobserver variability in interpreting placental pathology . due to logistic circumstances ,
the placentas were received fresh and were subjected to thorough gross morphologic assessment . the trimmed placental weight ( after fixation )
was compared to the gestational age and was determined to be low ( < 10th percentile ) , normal , or high ( > 90th percentile ) , as previously described by us .
for histological examination , we routinely included two samples from the cord , the membranes and two to three samples from macroscopically normal parenchyma as well as from any sites of focal change .
macroscopic and histological examination was performed according to a structured protocol ( see the appendix ) .
placental data included in this study are : placental weight in relation to / adjusted for gestational age , immaturity of placental villi , infarction , intervillous thrombosis , fetal thrombosis , presence of cam , vasculitis in the placenta or umbilical cord and/or funisitis ( inflammation of the umbilical cord ) , and chronic villitis .
cam was defined as the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the chorion or amnion layers with or without necrosis of the membranes and was initially assessed using a three - grade scale , essentially as described by rindsj et al . .
grade 1 : presence of polymorphonuclear leucocytes at the subchorionic plate and/or lower third of chorion ; grade 2 : at least two separate foci of leucocytic infiltration in chorion and amnion ; grade 3 : extensive leucocytic infiltration in chorion and amnion , together with necrosis of amniotic epithelium and/or microabscess formation .
because of the very small amount of grade 3 cases , grade 2 and 3 groups were studied together in the final statistical analysis .
vasculitis was defined as the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the vessel wall of chorionic plate or umbilical vessels .
chronic villitis was defined as the presence of a mononuclear cell ( lymphocyte , histiocyte , and plasma cell ) infiltrate in the villous stroma , often with destruction / necrosis of the villous parenchyma .
data were analyzed using student 's t - test ( comparing means between the groups ) , the mann - whitney u - test ( comparing medians between the groups ) or the chi - squared test or the fishers exact test ( comparing proportion between the groups ) as indicated in the tables .
bivariate analyses of categorical data were computed by univariable logistic regression , and risk factors were expressed as odds ratios ( or ) with 95% confidence intervals ( 95% ci ) . statistically significant and borderline significant variables in the univariable logistic regression were entered in a stepwise forward multivariable logistic regression analysis to obtain adjusted odds ratio ( aor ) with 95% ci .
mothers of stillborn babies were older and had a higher body mass index ( bmi ) than the controls ; the difference in bmi was not dependent on maternal age ( table 1(a ) ) .
there was a higher incidence of a history of miscarriage among the cases but the groups did not differ with respect to smoking habits , primiparity , previous stillbirth , severe illness or pregnancy complications , hb at admission to maternity health care centre , and sex of the infant or delivery method ( i.e. , caesarean section or vaginal delivery , table 1(a ) ) .
the rate of labour induction was , not surprisingly , different between the groups ( table 1(a ) ) since induction is routine in cases of stillbirth in sweden .
21.4% was sga , while only 2.9% was sga in the control group ( table 1(a ) ) .
similarly , the stillborn group showed lower absolute placental weight and a higher amount of small placental weight versus gestational age ( < 10th percentile ) when compared to the controls ( table 1(b ) ) . in the histological evaluation ,
several significant differences were noted ; placentas from stillborn cases had significantly more cam , villitis , immature villi , infarction , fetal thrombosis and vasculitis and/or funisitis ( table 1(b ) ) .
intervillous thrombosis did not differ between the groups ( table 1(b ) ) . in the stillbirth group ,
65.1% had cam ( of any grade ) compared with 40.7% in the control group ( p < .001 ) .
cam was initially graded ( grade 13 ) , but because there were only two cases of cam grade 3 in the stillbirth group and none in the control group , cam grades 2 and 3 were studied together ( referred to as severe cam ) , yielding a frequency of 33.3% in the stillbirth group and 11.4% in the control group .
cam grade 1 ( referred to as light cam ) was found in 31.7% in the stillbirth group and 29.3% in the control group ( table 1(b ) ) .
villitis was seen more frequently in the stillbirth group than in the control group ( 18.3% and 5.1% , resp . ,
villitis < 1% was found in 6.4% of the stillbirth group and 1.8% of the control group ; whereas 11.9% in the stillbirth group and 3.3% in the control group had 1% villitis ( table 1(b ) ) .
overweight or obesity ( bmi>24.9 ) , history of miscarriage , sga , low placental weight versus gestational age , immature placental villi , cam ( light and severe ) , vasculitis and/or funisitis , and villitis < 1% and 1% were all associated with an elevated risk for stillbirth in the univariable logistic regression ( table 2 ) .
smoking at registration in maternity centre , primiparity and severe illness or pregnancy complication , sex of the baby , and intervillous thrombosis were not associated with an increased risk whereas age > 34 years and infarction of placental villi were of borderline significance ( table 2 ) . as shown in table 1(b ) , fetal thrombosis was significantly overrepresented in stillborn placentas . however , since histopathological analysis can not with certainty discriminate between thromboses having occurred before fetal death , and those associated to postmortem changes this finding was not analyzed further statistically . in the stepwise forward multivariable logistic regression severe cam , immature placental villi and sga had the highest risk for stillbirth , but even light cam , villitis ( < 1% and 1% ) , and bmi > 24.9 were associated with an increased risk .
age > 34 years , previous miscarriage , low placental weight versus gestational age , and infarction were not found to be independent risk factors and were therefore not included in the final model of the multivariable logistic regression ( table 3 ) .
vasculitis and/or funisitis did not either show an independent risk but was forced in the model since it has a well - known association with cam [ 4 , 6 , 13 ] ( table 3 ) .
amniocentesis was performed in 49 stillborn cases ( 38.9% ) , and the bacterial culture was positive in six of those cases ( 12.2% ) .
because there were so few analyses , and no cultures were performed in the controls , no further analysis was done .
blood cultures from the stillborns ' heart were performed in 102 ( 81.0% ) of the 126 cases and was positive in 27 ( 26.5% ) of the analyzed cases.there was no statistical correlation between positive bacterial culture of heart blood and cam ( independent of grade ) , vasculitis , funisitis , villitis , or thrombosis ( data not presented ) .
in this study , we have found that cam , chronic villitis , immature placental villi , sga , and maternal overweight / obesity are independently associated with risk for stillbirth at term .
other studies have shown prevalence of cam in stillbirths ranging between 57% to 96% [ 1417 ] and in term liveborns from 5% to 68% [ 1319 ] .
the fact that the majority of studies claiming high proportions of cam were from developing countries may suggest some kind of underlying geographical / environmental factor . other explanations may include differences in the definition of stillbirth and histological cam , interobserver variability between reporting pathologists , small sample sizes , or selection of material .
the high frequency of cam in our control group might be additionally related to the selection criterion being liveborn , and not uncomplicated (  healthy  ) pregnancy , in contrast to several other reports .
our study is one of the largest studies in the literature and provides a comprehensive view of the stillbirth population in the major stockholm area .
a high frequency of cam , vasculitis and/or funisitis could be due to the duration of established contractions or the time interval between broken membranes and delivery .
a subanalysis of half of the vaginally delivered cases and controls did not show any difference concerning time between rupture of membranes and delivery but there was a significant difference regarding time from established contraction to delivery , with longer labour in the control group ( p < 0.05 , data not presented ) .
although cam is generally believed to represent an ascending microbial infection [ 14 , 17 , 18 , 20 ] , our results of blood culture from the heart of the neonate failed to show a bacterial etiology of this placental inflammation .
one reason for this might be that blood samples were only cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria .
the presence of other microorganisms , such as ureaplasma or mycoplasma , which have been related to stillbirth in other studies , may have eluded detection .
several studies have questioned the efficacy of culture alone for detecting bacteria [ 2123 ] suggesting the need for supplemental molecular techniques ( i.e. , pcr ) .
the high risk of stillbirth correlated to severe cam point and to the importance of clarifying the background of cam since it is obviously a threat to the fetus in term pregnancy .
vasculitis and funisitis are histological markers of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome and are risk markers for neurological impairment   and decreased psychomotor development [ 6 , 24 ] .
however , the relation between fetal inflammatory response syndrome and stillbirth is less well understood . in a recent work ,
found that absence of a fetal inflammatory response was strongly associated with unexplained antepartum death .
although vasculitis and/or funisitis were significantly more common in the placentas from stillborn than from liveborn neonates in our study , the risk of stillbirth was not elevated in the multivariate logistic regression analysis .
further studies are needed to elucidate whether fetal inflammatory response , exemplified by the presence of inflammation in fetal vessels and umbilical cord in the placenta , as well as cytokine release , is unrelated to the mechanisms of stillbirth or even confers some kind of protective action .
villitis affects 515% of all third trimester placentas   and has been associated with adverse neurologic outcomes , iugr , stillbirth [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] , premature delivery , and high maternal bmi .
recently showed   that the presence of chronic villitis in stillbirth placentas was associated with increased detection of viral dna , especially in advanced gestational ages , implicating a link between viral infection and the pathogenesis of stillbirth .
however , in the majority of cases , the etiology of chronic villitis remains unknown , often referred to as villitis of unknown etiology ( vue , ) .
myerson et al .   demonstrated that the majority of lymphocytes in vue are maternal t cells , and the process is associated to significant destruction of syncytiotrophoblast ; this may contribute to the breakdown of the local placental barrier and the graft - versus - host - like invasion of maternal cells into the villi . in our study ,
villitis , independent of the extent , was clearly overrepresented in stillbirth placentas ( 18.3% compared to 5.1% in controls ) and villitis ( < 1% or 1% ) had approximately a four - fold risk for stillbirth in term pregnancies .
our data do not provide any clues regarding the underlying mechanism , although it appears to not be a direct effect , that is , not related to extent of reduction of placental parenchyma .
rather , it might involve some subtle immunologic imbalance with possible secretion of regulatory cytokines or other factors in parallel with fetal inflammatory response .
villous immaturity , otherwise referred to as villous maturation defect , retarded villous maturation or terminal villous insufficiency , mainly involving a defect in villous vascularisation , is an often underrecognized entity .
the histopathological diagnosis is generally considered difficult , and a high rate of interobserver variability has been documented .
nevertheless , stallmach et al . clearly showed that this type of placental defect can be a cause of fetal hypoxia and is linked to highly increased risk for stillbirth , especially during the end of pregnancy .
our results confirm these observations , showing a more than six - fold risk of stillbirth .
villous immaturity has been associated to maternal diabetes   and trisomy 21 . among our stillbirth placentas showing villous immaturity , two ( 11% )
were connected to diabetes , a figure similar to the findings of stallmach et al . , and additional two had trisomy 21 ;
sga is a known risk factor for stillbirth   and can include infants with intrauterine growth retardation and be related to maternal smoking and mothers with illness as for example preeclampsia . in this study , we did not find an elevated risk for stillbirth among smoking mothers or mother with severe illness or pregnancy complication .
the lack of difference might be due to the small amount of smokers and mothers with severe illness or pregnancy complications that might lead to a type 2 error related to inadequate power in this study .
earlier studies have reported that high bmi is a risk factor for stillbirth . in this study
high bmi is an increasing problem globally and is associated with several diseases as preeclampsia and diabetes . even in healthy overweight and obese women , the risk for term stillbirth
there is always a risk for bias in case - control studies , for example , recall or observer bias . since the cases in this study were included after the stillbirth was identified and most of the information was collected from the maternity medical records , we do not think that recall bias is a big problem in this study , even though the risk can not be ignored .
the pathologist was not blinded for the groups , implying a risk for observer bias .
to decrease that risk , a structured protocol for placental examination was used . by using a graded scale for cam the risk for inter- and intra - observer variability
we could exclude the risk for interobserver variability since all placental examinations were performed by only one pathologist .
a disadvantage of this approach is that the reproducibility of placental findings is not validated , but we considered that outside the scope of the present study .
in summary , we found that cam , chronic villitis , immature placental villi , sga , and maternal overweight but not vasculitis or funisitis are independently associated with risk for stillbirth at term .","1. Introduction

"homelessness involves a complex array of inter - woven contributing factors and consequences , which can include gambling , drugs , and alcohol misuse .
homelessness can often result from poverty ( ocallaghan et  al . , 1996 ) .
financial hardship resulting from unemployment has previously been observed as a powerful predictor of homelessness ( kemp , lynch , & mackay , 2001 ) .
recent studies have suggested that poverty can have negative psychological effects on economic decision - making , encouraging risky and short - sighted choices that can perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty ( haushofer & fehr , 2014 ) . for many ,
gambling may be seen as an escape route from these severe financial difficulties , whereby even modest wins may have a significant impact on quality of life ( lopes , 1987 ) . in the most recent british gambling prevalence survey ( bgps ) , 73% of the general adult population reported gambling in the past 12  months ( wardle et  al . , 2011 ) and 0.7% met criteria for problem gambling using the problem gambling severity index ( pgsi , ferris & wynne , 2001 ) . as a postal survey , the bgps did not include various demographic sectors including the homeless , and a number of international studies have reported elevated levels of problem gambling in the homeless , in the range of 11.625% ( lepage , ladouceur , & jacques , 2000 ; matheson , devotta , wendaferew , & pedersen , 2014 ; nower , eyrich - garg , pollio , & north , 2015 ; shaffer , freed , & healea , 2002 ; sharman , dreyer , aitken , clark , & bowden - jones , 2015 ) . in the first study to examine this in the uk
, we recruited 456 homeless individuals from day centers and hostels in westminster , london .
the past year level of problem gambling on the pgsi was 11.6% ( sharman et  al . , 2015 ) .
problem gambling is significantly associated with substance use , mood , anxiety , and personality disorders ( petry , stinson , & grant , 2005 ) , and has been identified as a cause of homelessness in a number of qualitative studies based on interviews ( crane et  al . , 2005 ; holdsworth & tiyce , 2012 ; van laere , de wit , & klazinga , 2009 ) . however
, little work has examined the temporal sequencing of gambling and homelessness using quantitative analysis .
gambling was re - classified from an impulse control disorder to a behavioral addiction in the diagnostic manual of mental disorders ( 5th  ed . ; dsm-5 ; 
 american psychiatric association , 2013 ) , due to apparent overlap in underlying mechanisms and clinical presentation ( potenza , 2006 ) .
past work has identified elevated rates of substance and alcohol use disorders in the homeless ( mallett , rosenthal , & keys , 2005 ; neale , 2001 ; shelton , taylor , bonner , & van den bree , 2009 ) .
( 2015 ) found that 63% of their sample met lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence , and 60.4% met lifetime criteria for substance abuse or dependence . in a study of people sleeping rough in london ,
36% were drug dependent and 25% were alcohol dependent ( fountain , howes , marsden , taylor , & strang , 2003 ) .
notably , 47% reported that drug or alcohol problems were the major precipitant of their homelessness . in an australian study where the overall rate of substance use disorders was 43% ,
one third of the sample identified substance problems as preceding their homelessness , whereas two thirds developed substance problems after becoming homeless ( johnson & chamberlain , 2008 ) .
a further study identified substance , alcohol , and gambling disorders as the strongest predictors of homelessness in veterans ( edens , kasprow , tsai , & rosenheck , 2011 ) .
provision of treatment for problem gambling in the uk is limited , and even when effective treatment is available , improving awareness of these services is a major goal in public health . in the 2002 national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and
related conditions ( grant et al . , 2004 ) , participants who demonstrated lifetime gambling dependence were asked about their use of treatment services for gambling , including gamblers anonymous and any other kind of recognized health professional .
the combined rate for treatment seeking across all gambling services was 9.1% , indicating that less than one in ten problem gamblers had sought help for their gambling ( cunningham , 2005 ) .
this rate is lower than the corresponding rate for alcohol - related problems ( cunningham & breslin , 2004 ) . acknowledging that disordered gambling is a dimensional construct , this study sought to characterize gambling involvement in the homeless in terms of the rate of problem gambling and the distribution of pgsi risk categories .
most household surveys of gambling show a stepwise downward trend in the gambling risk categories , such that the modal group are  no risk ,  with diminishing number of low risk , moderate risk , and probable problem gamblers ( toce - gerstein , gerstein , & volberg , 2003 ) . in our preliminary study , the pgsi risk categories in the homeless did not follow this trend , with a sharp increase in the problem gambling category consistent with polarized behavior : homeless participants tended to either not gamble at all or endorse problematic gambling ( sharman et  al . , 2015 ) .
second , we sought to understand the temporal ordering of gambling and homelessness , to inform whether problem gambling was a possible cause of homelessness , or if gambling problems occurred post - homelessness . a third aim of the study was to ascertain rates of drug and alcohol misuse , in order to investigate their relationships with gambling as another addictive behavior .
finally , we sought to identify awareness and utilization of treatment and support services to the homeless population in relation to gambling .
participants ( n  =  72 , mean age  =  40.8 , sd  =  11.9 , 63 males ) were recruited from homeless shelters , day centers , and hostels throughout westminster local authority , london , and were considered homeless if they were  rough sleeping  on the streets or in night shelters , or living in hostels or other accommodation unsuitable for long - term habitation ( adapted from fitzpatrick , kemp , & klinker , 2000 ) .
the interview sections on gambling , drugs , and alcohol were each initiated with a screening item to minimize participant burden ; if the screening item was answered negatively , the rest of the section was scored as zero .
if participants answered positively to the gambling screening item , they were required to complete the pgsi ( ferris & wynne , 2001 ) to establish gambling involvement .
if participants answered positively to the alcohol or drug use screening questions , they were required to answer questions based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - iv - tr , 4th  ed . , text rev . , american psychiatric association , 2000 ) to establish alcohol and drug use and abuse .
participants completed a negative life events scale ( australian bureau of statistics , 2002 ) to establish the prevalence of negative life events , and answer options were modified to indicate the temporal relationship between the life event and homelessness .
pgsi scores were categorized based on the modified thresholds by currie , hodgins , and casey ( 2013 ) as  no risk 
( score of 0 ) ,  low risk  ( 14 ) ,  moderate risk  ( 57 ) , or  problem gambling 
as only one participant fell in the moderate risk group , the low - risk and moderate - risk cells were combined [ as recommended by currie et  al .
( pgsi scores of 17 ) , and  problem gambling  ( pgsi scores of > 7 ) . for alcohol and drug use criteria , the number of dsm - iv substance use disorder items endorsed was recorded .
a pearson product - moment correlation coefficient was computed to establish the relationship between alcohol , drugs , and gambling .
chi - squared analyses were used to ascertain frequency differences between  no risk  ( pgsi score of 0 ) ,  at risk 
( pgsi scores of 17 ) , and problem gambling ( pgsi scores of > 7 ) groups for negative life events , and treatment access per behaviour .
participants ( n  =  72 , mean age  =  40.8 , sd  =  11.9 , 63 males ) were recruited from homeless shelters , day centers , and hostels throughout westminster local authority , london , and were considered homeless if they were  rough sleeping  on the streets or in night shelters , or living in hostels or other accommodation unsuitable for long - term habitation ( adapted from fitzpatrick , kemp , & klinker , 2000 ) .
the interview sections on gambling , drugs , and alcohol were each initiated with a screening item to minimize participant burden ; if the screening item was answered negatively , the rest of the section was scored as zero .
if participants answered positively to the gambling screening item , they were required to complete the pgsi ( ferris & wynne , 2001 ) to establish gambling involvement .
if participants answered positively to the alcohol or drug use screening questions , they were required to answer questions based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - iv - tr , 4th  ed . , text rev . , american psychiatric association , 2000 ) to establish alcohol and drug use and abuse .
participants completed a negative life events scale ( australian bureau of statistics , 2002 ) to establish the prevalence of negative life events , and answer options were modified to indicate the temporal relationship between the life event and homelessness .
pgsi scores were categorized based on the modified thresholds by currie , hodgins , and casey ( 2013 ) as  no risk 
( score of 0 ) ,  low risk  ( 14 ) ,  moderate risk  ( 57 ) , or  problem gambling 
as only one participant fell in the moderate risk group , the low - risk and moderate - risk cells were combined [ as recommended by currie et  al .
a pearson product - moment correlation coefficient was computed to establish the relationship between alcohol , drugs , and gambling .
chi - squared analyses were used to ascertain frequency differences between  no risk  ( pgsi score of 0 ) ,  at risk 
( pgsi scores of 17 ) , and problem gambling ( pgsi scores of > 7 ) groups for negative life events , and treatment access per behaviour .
participant demographics ( n  =  72 ) can be seen in table  1 .
past year gambling was endorsed by 32 participants ( 44.4% ) , which is less than the 73% of the general population who endorsed past year gambling in the bgps .
participant s scores on the pgsi were classified as no risk ( n  =  46 , 63.9% ) , low / moderate risk ( n  =  9 , 12.5% ) , or problem gamblers ( n  =  17 , 23.6% ) . comparing the risk category distribution to national data from the bgps ( wardle et  al . , 2011 ) , there was a reliable difference between the two data sets (  ( 2 )  =  27.98 , p  <

this study sought to examine the rates of gambling involvement in a homeless sample , in order to ascertain the temporal sequencing of problematic gambling and homelessness , the associations with drug and alcohol misuse , and to establish the awareness and utilization of treatment and support services .
our observed rate of problem gambling of 23.6% is similar to previous rates in the homeless , both in a previous study in london ( sharman et  al . , 2015 ) and international data [ matheson et  al . , 2014 ( 25% ) ; nower et  al . ,
these rates are well above the rates in the general population , confirming the vulnerable status of the homeless to gambling . of note ,
pgsi risk rates in the general population typically show a stepwise decrease with increasing gambling severity ( bgps , wardle et  al . , 2011 ) , but this pattern was inverted in the homeless . of homeless individuals who endorse any gambling , they were most likely to be classified in the  problem gambling  category .
this profile also replicates our recent observations from a larger but less detailed survey ( sharman et  al . , 2015 ) .
( 2008 ) compared age of onset data to establish the temporal sequencing of problem gambling with its comorbid disorders : problem gambling tended to have a later age of onset than major depression , general anxiety disorder , panic disorder , and other impulse control disorders , but preceded nicotine dependence and post - traumatic stress disorder .
substance abuse was similarly likely to predate or post - date problem gambling . in the problem gamblers identified by the pgsi in this study
this was corroborated by the negative life events scale , on which the participants with any level of gambling risk showed significantly elevated rates of two notable types of negative life event prior to becoming homeless : gambling problems and significant job loss .
unemployment often leads to financial hardship and poverty , and is an established and powerful predictor of homelessness ( kemp et  al . ,
poverty has also been independently associated with impaired economic decision making ( haushofer & fehr , 2014 ) , which could further contribute to gambling tendencies .
the potential for the development of problem gambling is congruent with circumstances created by poverty and poor financial and economic decision making .
it must be noted that a smaller subset of gamblers endorsed the opposite temporal sequencing , that their homelessness precedes their gambling problems .
this could be a result of a change in the subjective utility of gambling per se , or secondary factors such as the shelter or hot drinks that are often provided by betting shops .
our results showed high rates of substance and alcohol disorder , drug and alcohol dependence , supporting previous work within a homeless sample in london ( fountain et  al . , 2003 ) .
the pattern of substance and alcohol use showed a similar profile to gambling behavior ; the homeless participants tended to exhibit extremes of gambling behavior , either not gambling at all , or gambling problematically ; the homeless substance and alcohol users demonstrated a similar pattern , either not using alcohol or substances at all , or using problematically .
this pattern in both gambling and substance abuse behaviors could be reflective of an underlying vulnerability trait ; elevated impulsivity and preference for immediate reward has previously been observed in problem gamblers ( michalczuk , bowden - jones , verdejo - garcia , & clark , 2011 ) , and substance and alcohol users ( de wit , 2009 ; marczinski , abroms , van selst , & fillmore , 2005 ; sher & trull , 1994 ) . however , despite showing similar engagement patterns , our results indicated that problem gambling did not correlate with drug or alcohol use .
previous studies have provided inconsistent evidence regarding the relationships between substance and alcohol disorders and gambling ; nower et al . ( 2015 ) demonstrated high levels of substance and alcohol disorders within a gambling cohort , whereas shaffer , freed , and healea ( 2002 ) found level 3 gamblers had experienced less drug treatment engagement than level 1 and 2 gamblers .
inconsistent findings could be moderated by demographic differences between samples , availability of both substances and gambling opportunities , or where due to the limited funds available to the participants , the individual is forced to choose between substance use and gambling .
similar to treatment - seeking pathological gamblers in a british clinical sample ( michalczuk et  al . ,
2011 ) , our homeless participants identified fixed odds betting terminals as the most problematic form of gambling . as a further objective , we sought to identify awareness and utilization of treatment and support services to the homeless population in relation to gambling , compared with drug and alcohol problems .
significantly , fewer gamblers were either aware of and/or used treatment services for problem gambling than drug users and alcohol drinkers for their respective behaviors .
for some of the hostels within the westminster area , engagement with treatment and support services provided by the hostel and outside agencies for drug and alcohol problems forms part of the accommodation agreement .
this is not the case for gambling , which are also more easily hidden from staff during routine assessments due to the lack of obvious physiological symptoms . as engagement in treatment is compulsory for drugs and alcohol , and is not for gambling problems , the absolute comparison between awareness and utilization of services is potentially distorted ; however , the fact that treatment for some behavior is compulsory , and is not compulsory for others serves to highlight how gambling problems are not considered to be as serious as substance abuse problems .
some methodological limitations must be noted ; the study was restricted to a small sample due to time and financial limitations . as people with differing mental health and support needs
are allocated to an appropriate hostel , approximately equal numbers of participants were interviewed at each hostel to avoid a sampling bias .
results should be replicated in a larger sample before more concrete conclusions can be drawn .
each homeless individual has a different background and a different story , therefore certain aspects of data collection would be more suited to qualitative analysis ; however , to facilitate rapid data collection , interviews were structured , and answers were selected from a predetermined range of options allowing us to confidently establish prevalence rates .
the results are limited to one local authority within london ( westminster ) , an area that is known to have a high concentration of bookmaker s shops as well as one of the highest concentrations of homeless people in the country .
data from the current study reinforces the assertion that problem gambling is a significant issue within the homeless population , and is more commonly a cause than a consequence of homelessness . despite the elevated prevalence ,
fewer homeless gamblers are aware of , or seek treatment for , their gambling problems compared with those with substance abuse problems , highlighting the under - recognized nature of gambling problems .
homelessness is a multiply - determined outcome arising from the interplay between individual characteristics and social structures .
gambling is likely to be significant contributing factor for some people , and should be considered when assessing the treatment and support needs of the homeless .

"the framingham heart study is a prospective cohort study that began in 1948 . in 1971 ,
the offspring and spouses of the original cohort were enrolled in the offspring study , and in 2002 the children of the original cohort 's offspring were enrolled in the third generation study . between june 2002 and april 2005 , 3,529 offspring and third generation participants underwent chest and abdominal computed tomographic ( ct ) scanning in conjunction with the multi - detector computed tomography ( mdct ) substudy .
the present study sample consisted of the 3,001 participants ( 1,455 women and 1,546 men ) who had interpretable ct scans ( both chest and abdominal ) , who were free of cardiovascular disease , and who had complete covariate information .
the institutional review boards of the boston university medical center and massachusetts general hospital approved the study protocol . all subjects provided informed written consent .
participants underwent eight - slice mdct abdominal scanning in a supine position ( lightspeed ultra , general electric , milwaukee , wi ) .
twenty - five contiguous 5-mm thick slices ( 120 kvp , 400 ma , gantry rotation time 500 ms , and table feed 3:1 ) were obtained , covering 125 mm above the level of s1 .
vat and sat volumes were quantified from ct scans using a dedicated offline workstation ( aquarius 3d workstation ; terarecon , san mateo , ca ) using a semiautomatic segmentation technique .
an image display window width of 195 to 45 hounsfield units and a window center of 120 hounsfield units were used to identify pixels containing fat .
vat was defined as adipose tissue inside the abdominal muscular wall and sat as adipose tissue outside the abdominal muscular wall .
interclass correlations for inter - reader comparisons were 0.997 for sat and 0.992 for vat on a random sample of 100 scans ; high intra - reader correlations were similarly obtained .
covariates were measured at the seventh framingham offspring examination ( 19982001 ) and the first third generation examination ( 20022005 ) .
bmi was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters .
serum triglycerides , total and hdl cholesterol , and fasting plasma glucose were measured in fasting morning samples obtained from attendees .
diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose 126 mg / dl or treatment with a hypoglycemic agent or insulin ; impaired fasting glucose was defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of 100125 mg / dl in the absence of diabetes treatment .
hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mmhg and diastolic blood pressure as 90 mmhg or antihypertensive treatment .
low hdl was defined as < 40 mg / dl for men or < 50 mg / dl for women .
alcohol use was evaluated through a physician - administered questionnaire and categorized as more or less than 14 drinks per week ( men ) or 7 drinks per week ( women ) .
metabolic syndrome was defined by modified adult treatment panel iii criteria ( impaired fasting glucose defined as fasting plasma glucose 100125 mg / dl in the absence of treatment of diabetes , the high triglyceride component was defined as triglycerides150 mg / dl or treatment with a lipid - lowering agent , and blood pressure criteria were modified to include treatment for hypertension ) .
study participants were stratified by vat into sex - specific tertiles . within each tertile , subjects were categorized further into sex - specific abdominal sat tertiles .
age - adjusted means and prevalences of risk factors including bmi , waist circumference , fasting glucose , diabetes , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , hypertension , and the metabolic syndrome were compared across the sat tertiles .
because overall and visceral adiposity increases with age , all analyses were age - adjusted . as a secondary analysis , participants were separately stratified into sat tertiles within each clinical bmi category ( normal weight , overweight , and obese ) , and the analyses were repeated .
all analyses were performed using sas ( version 9.1 ) ; two - tailed values of p < 0.05 were considered significant .

overall , 1,455 women ( mean age 51.4 years ) and 1,546 men ( mean age 48.6 years ) comprised the study sample .
the average bmi was 26.7 kg / m for women and 28.3 kg / m for men , with 24.1% of women and 27.3% of men classified as obese .
approximately one - quarter of women had high triglycerides , low hdl , hypertension , and the metabolic syndrome , whereas 41.1% of men had high triglycerides , 31.1% had low hdl , 28.5% had hypertension , and 35.2% had the metabolic syndrome .

the age - adjusted linear trend was significant for systolic blood pressure ( 109 mmhg in sat tertile 1 vs. 114 mmhg in sat tertile 3 , p < 0.001 ) .
of particular note are the significant increases in prevalence rates of impaired fasting glucose ( 19.1% in sat tertile 1 vs. 29.1% in sat tertile 3 , p = 0.03 ) and high triglycerides ( 12.1% in sat tertile 1 vs. 20.4% in sat tertile 3 , p = 0.04 ) .

for example , linear trends for rates of metabolic syndrome were significant for both women ( 51.2% in sat tertile 1 vs. 65.1% in sat tertile 3 , p = 0.02 ) and men ( 55.6% in sat tertile 1 vs. 73.0% in sat tertile 3 , p = 0.001 ) .
however , the pattern of increase in risk factor prevalence across sat tertiles present among the bottom two vat tertiles was notably absent among both men and women in the highest vat tertile for low hdl and among men for fasting glucose and impaired fasting glucose despite large increases in bmi across sat tertiles ( 27.1 vs. 36.3 kg / m for women and 28.1 vs. 35.7 kg / m for men ) .
in addition , prevalence rates of high triglycerides in men decreased significantly with increasing sat ( 64.4% in sat tertile 1 vs. 52.7% in sat tertile 3 , p = 0.03 ) .

cardiometabolic risk increases with increasing visceral adiposity and bmi . among those in the bottom two vat tertiles , increasing subcutaneous fat
is generally associated with increases in risk factor prevalence . among those in the highest vat tertile , however , increasing sat is not associated with uniform increases in risk factors prevalence , despite significant increases in bmi , waist circumference sat , and vat .
most striking , linear trends for triglycerides actually decrease with increasing sat in the top vat tertile , suggesting that subcutaneous fat may be associated with beneficial effects on triglyceride levels in those with the most visceral fat .
although total adiposity is strongly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular risk , it is becoming increasingly clear that different fat compartments contribute differentially to these risks .
abdominal visceral fat is a stronger correlate of cardiovascular disease risk than bmi , waist circumference , or abdominal subcutaneous fat ( 5,6 ) .
central obesity , in which fat mass is predominantly intra - abdominal , is more strongly associated with insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and atherosclerosis than is peripheral obesity , in which fat is predominantly gluteofemoral ( 1,15 ) .
weight loss through diet and exercise , which results in reductions in visceral fat ( 16 ) , is associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity ( 17 ) , blood pressure ( 18 ) , serum lipids ( 19 ) , and inflammatory markers ( 20 ) .
similarly , loss of vat by omentectomy leads to decreases in glucose and insulin levels ( 11 ) , whereas loss of sat by liposuction does not always produce the same beneficial effects ( 12,13 ) , suggesting that vat is more likely to be responsible for the metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity .
a few studies have suggested a possible beneficial role for sat , observing that increased hip and thigh fat mass is associated with lower glucose and lipid levels , independent of abdominal fat ( 9 ) .
patients with lipodystrophic loss of sat have an increased risk for insulin resistance , diabetes , and dyslipidemia ( 21 ) . in mice , transplantation of subcutaneous fat into visceral compartments leads to decreases in body weight and total fat mass and improved glucose metabolism , whereas transplantation of visceral fat into either subcutaneous or visceral compartments results in no such improvements .
this suggests that subcutaneous fat may differ from visceral fat in ways that are metabolically beneficial ( 14 ) .
the prevalence of many risk factors , including hypertension and the metabolic syndrome , also increases with increasing sat for all vat and bmi tertiles . among those in the lower two - thirds of the vat distribution ,
more sat is also associated with increased risk of most other risk factors examined , suggesting that sat is not protective in these individuals . among those with the most vat , however , increased sat is associated with lower triglycerides , suggesting that sat may be associated with beneficial effects on triglyceride levels in the obese .
the ectopic fat hypothesis suggests that a hallmark of obesity is fat deposition in liver , skeletal muscle , and pancreatic -cells resulting from insufficient adipocyte growth and differentiation in the setting of nutritional excess ( 22 ) .
such ectopic fat stores are theorized to affect tissue and organ function by physical compression , the secretion of various locally acting substances , and cell dysfunction or cell death of nonadipose cells , a phenomenon known as lipotoxicity ( 7 ) . in line with this theory , sat represents a proper expansion of nonpathogenic adipocytes and therefore may be considered a protective fat depot ( 22 ) .
improvements in insulin sensitivity with thiazolidinedione treatment , which increases subcutaneous fat stores , are suggestive of a protective effect of sat ( 10 ) .
our results are consistent with a potential protective role for sat in the case of triglycerides among the obese .
another possible explanation for obesity - related cardiometabolic disease is the portal vein hypothesis , which proposes that increased visceral fat leads to higher free fatty acid concentrations in the portal vein , increased systemic fatty acid flux , and increased hepatic lipase activity , which removes lipids from ldl and hdl , and may lead to dyslipidemia ( 23 ) .
although our results do not contradict the detrimental effects of vat proposed by the portal vein hypothesis ( the prevalence of all risk factors increased with vat tertile in our sample ) , they do support the notion that such a theory is , at best , incomplete because it does not explain either the detrimental or the beneficial effects of sat , which does not drain through the portal vein , on cardiometabolic risk .
vat and sat differ not only in anatomic location but also in cytokine secretion profile . sat releases 23 times more leptin than vat ( 24 ) , whereas vat secretes more adiponectin , interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 , and angiotensin than does sat ( 23 ) .
although the relationships between vat and sat secretion profiles and cardiometabolic pathogenesis are , at present , unclear , it may be that paracrine and perhaps endocrine factors contribute to the differential effects of vat and sat .
it is important to note that our results suggest a possible protective effect of sat only among those in the highest tertile of vat . indeed , in the lower vat tertiles , increasing sat
one explanation for this difference is that there is a relatively larger increase in vat in the lower tertiles and that sat is simply a marker for increased vat in these groups .
sat by itself may not be deleterious or beneficial in the absence of the positive energy balance of obesity .
accordingly , sat may only be protective in obese individuals because these individuals are already in positive energy balance and sat provides a nonpathological energy storage depot .
it is also important to note that the lack of increase in the prevalence of risk factors such as low ldl and impaired fasting glucose with increasing sat among the obese may be due to a threshold effect , whereby risk factor prevalence is already so high that increasing sat is not associated with further increases in prevalence .
compared with previous work on subcutaneous fat and cardiometabolic risk , the strengths of the present study include a large sample size with a wide range of bmi and age , thereby reducing the likelihood of ascertainment bias in the results .
in addition , the study benefits from the quantification of fat volumes from ct scans rather than a single - slice measurement of fat area .
a major limitation of the study is its lack of data on subcutaneous fat stores aside from the abdomen ; therefore , we can not generalize our findings to gluteofemoral fat .
. it may be that superficial sat is less pathogenic than deep sat ( 25 ) .
in addition , analysis by vat and sat tertiles increases the number of statistical tests performed , increasing the likelihood of false - positive results at the p < 0.05 significance level .
other limitations include the cross - sectional study design , which precludes inferences of causality , and the lack of ethnic diversity , which may limit generalizability to nonwhite groups . in summary , whereas abdominal adiposity is associated with a higher absolute risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease , subcutaneous abdominal fat is not associated with a linear increase in the prevalence of all risk factors among the obese
. indeed , in the case of high triglycerides , sat may actually be a protective fat depot in obese individuals .
cardiometabolic risk increases with increasing visceral adiposity and bmi . among those in the bottom two vat tertiles , increasing subcutaneous fat
is generally associated with increases in risk factor prevalence . among those in the highest vat tertile , however , increasing sat is not associated with uniform increases in risk factors prevalence , despite significant increases in bmi , waist circumference sat , and vat .

"infections of permanent pacemakers ( ppms ) and implantable cardioverter - defibrillators ( icds ) with gram - negative organisms are uncommon . in one study of 123 patients with ppm
infection of a pacemaker with salmonella species specifically is exceedingly rare , and documented with a few case reports and as part of a cohort of patients with both gram - negative bacteremia and ppm / icds , .
we report a case of icd pocket infection with salmonella enterica serotype blockley ( salmonella blockley ) . to the best of our knowledge ,
a 76-year - old chinese man with systolic heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus who had undergone an icd placement in 2012 presented at the cardiology clinic for evaluation of the gradual onset of pain , redness and warmth from the icd pocket site for one month , more than a year after the surgery for implantation .
he was recently prescribed an unrecalled oral antibiotic by his primary care provider without improvement , and there was note of insidious onset of erosion of skin over the pocket site .
three weeks later , the wound developed purulent discharge and he was advised inpatient admission for treatment . at no point in the presenting illness did the patient develop fever , chills , or gastrointestinal symptoms . on physical examination , the left pectoral icd pocket site was tender , erythematous , and fluctuant , with a sinus draining purulent material .
initial wound cultures obtained yielded salmonella blockley that was susceptible to ampicillin ( mic , 2  mg / l ) , trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( mic , 20  mg / l ) , levofloxacin ( mic , 0.12  mg
identification of the isolate and susceptibility testing was done by the new york city department of health and mental hygiene .
the serum creatinine level was 0.81  mg / dl and the peripheral white blood cell count was 5.8    10  cells / mm ( neutrophil percentage , 61.8% ) .
the device was sent to the laboratory for cultures , which yielded s. blockley in both the generator and the leads .
a peripherally inserted central catheter ( picc ) was placed and the patient was discharged with home care , to complete a 21-day course of ceftriaxone dosed at 2  g daily .
he was readmitted briefly during this period to evacuate a hematoma that had developed over the former pocket site , but otherwise had an unremarkable convalescence . on 21-day follow - up at the outpatient infectious disease clinic ,
the wound was well - healed and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued . he was prescribed a 7-day course of amoxicillin  clavulanate and continued to have no further complications on subsequent follow - up visits .
it is estimated that between 1 and 7% of cardiac implantable electronic devices ( cied ) become infected , with the risk increased in patients with diabetes mellitus , previous glucocorticoid therapy , underlying malignancy , operator inexperience , multiple lead placement , advanced patient age , oral anticoagulant use , frequent generator replacement , heart failure , fever before implantation , use of temporary pacing catheters , nonpectoral implantations , and renal dysfunction .
if the infection occurs within 2 weeks of implantation , staphylococcus aureus is most frequently implicated , but beyond this period , other organisms are more frequently seen , usually skin flora ( coagulase - negative staphylococci ) , s. aureus , other gram - positive cocci ( enterococcus and streptococcus ) and , less frequently , gram - negative bacilli ,
. the route of infection in our patient can be most likely attributed to secondary seeding from an enteric source , since salmonella species are not usually contaminants encountered at implantation , and clinical signs of infection appeared more than a year after surgery . during the patient 's clinical course , no organism was ever recovered in blood cultures , which indicates that there was probably transient bacteremia which led to seeding .
the organism isolated from culture , salmonella blockley , is rarely encountered in human infections , and most of the literature describes gastrointestinal infections .
one of the earliest reports of s. blockley infections was of an institutional outbreak due to contaminated ice cream with unpasteurized egg yolks .
approximately 40% of 167 infected people manifested symptoms of moderate fever , diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal cramping . in 1998 , 35 cases of s. blockley gastroenteritis were reported throughout greece ; however , inquiries about various risk factors did not elucidate a common exposure among the cases .
an outbreak of s. blockley gastroenteritis was also described in germany in june 1998 . in this study
, antibiotic resistance patterns and molecular typing suggested that the source of the outbreak could be traced from fish farms in veneto , italy .
isolates of s. blockley have been studied from contaminated pigs and poultry products in the far east , south africa , ethiopia , and italy , , , .
our patient emigrated from china in 2009 and went on a tour of several european countries in 2011 , about a year prior to surgery .
however , he did not report developing fever or gastrointestinal symptoms during or immediately after the trip .
it can not be ascertained at which point our patient acquired an enteric s. blockley infection that may have led to subsequent infection of the icd . given the infection of the leads , superficial erosion of the pocket site , and formation of an abscess , removal of the icd was indicated for our patient . in cases of superficial or incisional infections ,
the isolate in our case was susceptible to beta - lactams and had intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin .
effective treatment was achieved with removal of the device and prolonged administration of ceftriaxone , though in future cases , care must be taken to determine the susceptibility of the isolate , as multidrug resistance has been described .
human infections with salmonella blockley are rare and most cases described are gastrointestinal in origin .
our patient appears to be the first case of s. blockley infection of a pacemaker , though other salmonella species have been known to cause ppm / icd infections as well .
device infections with salmonella must not be overlooked in patients who present late after surgery , especially with known residence or travel to endemic areas .","Introduction

"the diagnosis is made histologically and usually refers to a neutrophilic infiltration around the eccrine sweat glands and mostly around the proximal portion coils .
neh is usually described in relation to other neutrophilic dermatoses , a group of skin diseases characterized by an infiltration of the skin by normal polymorphonuclear neutrophils no infectious or other causes are identified ; thus , its clinical aspect makes neh sometimes difficult to distinguish from the sweet syndrome , an entity that will not be addressed in detail in this article .
neh is a rare condition , though epidemiology was not precisely studied for this condition .
neutrophilic dermatoses in granulocytopenic patients receiving chemotherapy occur at an incidence rate of 2.6% ( according to an article published in 1995 ) .
furthermore , some case reports describe a facial neh that can mimic cellulitis . for these patients , proper recognition of neh can prevent unnecessary usage of antibiotics . in this article
, we describe a classic case of neh with facial involvement in a patient receiving chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia .
a 58-year - old patient was admitted to the centre hospitalier universitaire de sherbrooke for weight loss , fatigue , sleep alteration , mouth pain and difficulty in mastication due to gingival infiltration . except for chronic back pain and a 40-pack - year smoking history ,
after proper investigations , he was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia ( aml-5b monoblastic and monocytic ) and prescribed the 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy protocol ( table 1 ) .
the patient also received amikacin ( aminoglycoside ) and meropenem for a febrile neutropenia and valacyclovir for orolabial herpes .
twelve days after the beginning of his treatment , the patient was referred to the dermatology division because of an acute , non - itchy , non - scaly skin eruption that progressed over 23 days and affected various regions of his body ( the face and neck region , arms , upper back , and legs ) .
the examination revealed dark erythematous , violaceous and edematous plaques on the right and left periorbital areas , on the nose root ( fig .
1 ) , and on the neck . the right forearm had a unique , dry , non - scaly , round and well - delimited purple plaque .
histological features consisted of an inflammatory neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding the deep part of the eccrine glands and edema of the dermis ( fig .
another skin specimen was sent for culture and was negative for bacteria , mycobacteria , mycoses and virus . following the confirmed diagnosis , symptomatic treatment with potent corticosteroid cream
was enforced . the neutrophil count normalized without filgrastim after 3 weeks . as for the neh ,
it slowly resolved with topical corticosteroid treatment , leaving faint , post - inflammatory erythematous plaques in the areas described above .
a preventive treatment with oral dapsone was recommended for a possible consolidation chemotherapy step involving cytarabine .
it is associated with an adult population diagnosed with leukemia and receiving chemotherapy . a computerized literature review by bachmeyer and aractingi   analyzed 51 patients from 1982 to 1998 . from 1998 until may 2013 ,
several articles are mentioned below . while considering this diagnosis , one must first rule out an infection .
tissue cultures for bacteria , mycobacteria , fungi and viruses must be considered and are generally negative . in this case , the patient presented erythematous and edematous plaques in the periorbital region , mimicking orbital cellulitis .
six patients receiving induction chemotherapy with cytarabine for acute myelogenous leukemia presented facial plaques with similar descriptions [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .
however , observations regarding the evolution of the plaques are poor except for 3 of the cases in whom the lesions slowly extended across the face [ 5 , 7 ] or neck - trunk region . finally , all of the 6 patients presented with febrile neutropenia .
interestingly , we found one article describing a patient with periorbital , violaceous patches to acetaminophen .
ultimately , facial neh was also described in 1 healthy patient with no medical history .
the lesions are dark , erythematous , violaceous , or purpuric compared to cellulitis , where erythema with poorly defined margins ( or sharp borders in erysipelas ) is described .
clinical cases have described neh with tender and painful lesions . also , warmth of the affected area was not used to describe neh , but may contribute to a cellulitis diagnosis .
cellulitis continues to be a far more common clinical problem and the final neh diagnosis remains histopathological .
infectious agents such as hiv [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] , gram - positive cocci , streptoccoccus spp .
, enterobacter cloacae   and staphyloccocus aureus   were reported in patients who presented classical histological features of neh . as mentioned above
, the diagnosis is histological and the biopsy demonstrates a neutrophilic infiltrate of the eccrine unit , edema of the dermis , and necrosis of the eccrine coils and glands .
toxic byproducts are secreted through sweat , and thus , by neutrophilic chemotaxis induced by cellular damage , infiltration with neutrophils of the eccrine coils and glands occurs .
consequently , the toxic concentration of the drugs within the eccrine gland may lead to necrosis of the epithelial cells .
even so , no studies that evaluated the drug concentration in sweat glands were found .
another model describes neh as a part of the neutrophilic dermatoses spectrum , as a paraneoplastic condition . as mentioned ,
therefore , a theory regarding possible sweat gland abnormalities was formulated . generally , neh is a self - limiting condition .
the treatment is symptomatic and mainly involves topical or systemic corticosteroids [ 1 , 7 , 9 ] .
one study in a healthy patient reports colchicine use with improvement after 1 month . as for the prevention of possible recurrences of neh with the same drug use ,
one case report encourages dapsone use , which has specific effects on neutrophil migration , with a dosage of 100 mg daily for 48 h before the treatment .
we have reported a febrile neutropenic patient undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia who presented classic neh lesions .
the differential diagnosis includes cellulitis , and thus we emphasize the necessity of a prompt diagnosis in order to prevent the use of multiple antibiotics . in our case ,","Background

"in 2003 , a 43-year - old white woman who had undergone a pulmonary lobectomy during childhood underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of severe chronic respiratory failure caused by bilateral bronchiectasis .
the posttransplant period was complicated by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome stage 1 , with episodes of acute respiratory distress .
the immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus ( through level 1015 ng / ml ) , low - dose steroids ( 0.10 mg / kg / day ) , and monthly courses of extracorporeal photopheresis that were initiated after a 3-month course of low - dose azythromycin ( discontinued because of lack of efficacy ) . in january 2012
she had cough and fever ( 38c ) , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea ( 610 bowel movements / day , liquid but not bloody ) .
routine fecal examination and cultures were negative for common gastrointestinal bacteria ( mycobacteria , salmonella , shigella , and campylobacter spp . ) , parasites ( protozoa and helminths ) , and viruses ( astrovirus , norovirus , rotavirus , adenovirus ) . because of the patient s persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and a positive fecal calprotectin result , a colonoscopy was performed ; it revealed inflamed cecal mucosa without ulcerative lesions .
histologic examination of colonic biopsy samples showed mild , chronic , interstitial inflammation , including eosinophils and lymphoid microaggregates .
therefore , fecal samples were examined for less common gastroenteric viral agents  rhinovirus , bocavirus , enterovirus , parechovirus , coronavirus , sapovirus , aichivirus and hcosv  by using conventional and real - time pcr or nested reverse transcription pcr ( rt - pcr ) ( 1,714 ) .
this virus was detected by a nested rt - pcr targeting the 5 untranslated region ( utr ) ( 1 ) and quantified on the basis of serial log10 dilution of extracted nucleic acid estimating the presence of 10 rna copies / ml in fecal samples .
the 316-bp 5 utr amplicon was sequenced by using an abi prism 3100 dna automatic sequencer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , assembled by sequencer software , version 5.0 ( gene codes corporation , ann arbor , mi , usa ) , and compared with available hcosv sequences with the blast program ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) .
nucleotide identity with the hcosv species d ( species d1 ) ( genbank accession no .
fj438908 ) was 93% . because the 5 utr is not sufficiently discriminatory for typing , we sequenced the highly variable region encompassing vp3vp1 genes , obtained according to a published protocol ( 6 ) .
phylogenetic analysis , performed with the maximum - likelihood method with parameters selected by the model selection tool in mega version 5.0 ( 15 ) , showed that the hcosv vp3vp1 sequence from italy clustered with species e strains found in australia and bolivia and recombinant d / e strains circulating in nigeria .
although homology was greatest ( 97% nt and 81% aa identity ) with a strain from australia ( genbank accession no .
fj555055 ) ( figure ) , the hypothesis that this hcosv strain might be a d / e recombinant strain ( 6 ) can not be excluded because the recombination breakpoint between vp1 and the 2a gene was not investigated .
bootstrap values were set for 1,000 repetitions and were placed over each main node of the tree .
the strain from the lung transplant recipient with chronic diarrhea , in italy , is indicated in boldface .
, we retrospectively tested 689 stored fecal samples for hcosv positivity by using the same nested rt - pcr ( 1 ) .
the samples had been collected during april 2011april 2012 from patients hospitalized at our hospital with gastrointestinal signs and symptoms . of these 689 patients , 333 ( 48.3% ) were adults ( 230 [ 69.0% ] immunocompetent and 103 [ 31.0% ] immunocompromised ) and 356 ( 51.7% ) were children ( 275 [ 77.2% ] immunocompetent and 81 [ 22.8% ] immunocompromised ) . surprisingly ,
none of these samples were positive for hcosv . in the absence of specific therapy ,
the patient reported here underwent parenteral rehydration and nutritional supplementation ; her general condition improved progressively , and her bowel movements were reduced to 23 per day , enabling her to be discharged within a month . however , her gastrointestinal symptoms persisted , and 3 fecal samples collected at 4 , 6 , and 7 months after discharge were positive for the same hcosv strain ( at a high titer of 1010 virus rna copies / ml feces ) but negative for other viruses , bacteria , and parasites .
the infection was detected in 1 of 689 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms who were hospitalized and tested during the same period .
unique to this patient were the prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and the chronic gastrointestinal symptoms with persistently hcosv - positive fecal samples .
the persistence of symptoms and virus are additional new findings that might be associated with the patient s immune impairment .
the source of infection has not been determined . however , the patient denied domestic or international travel and close contact with persons returning from travel .
because no other hcosv infection was detected in patients hospitalized at the same institution during the same period , we hypothesize that the infection was acquired in the patient s community before her hospitalization .
the genetic similarity with e strains circulating in south america , australia , and central africa suggest local acquisition of an imported infection . however , additional evidence is required before excluding the potential autochthonous circulation of hcosv in northern italy .","The Study

"patients taking warfarin typically have significant comorbidity , often related to the indication for which their warfarin was prescribed .
comorbidity is known to be associated with increased mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 3 .
previous studies have not adjusted for comorbidity when analysing the outcome of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users , and therefore they may have overestimated the association between mortality and warfarin use 4 
 5 .  
the coagulopathy induced by warfarin is readily reversible , providing a treatment strategy that may improve outcome .
this effect is likely to be most apparent in patients taking warfarin who have a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio ( inr ) .
this analysis compares 30-day mortality from upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users with a supratherapeutic inr and 30-day mortality in non   
warfarin users , adjusting for potential confounding by matching to a control group for variables known to influence survival in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage .
the study was conducted in a single regional hospital ( waikato hospital , hamilton , new zealand ) between 23rd february 2001 and 12 october 2010 . for all patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at presentation to the hospital or during an admission for a different condition , the following were recorded prospectively in a dedicated upper gastrointestinal bleed database : presenting features , endoscopic diagnosis , presence of stigmata of recent hemorrhage ( including forrest classification of peptic ulceration ) 6 
 7 and administered treatment .
those patients with evidence of variceal bleeding were excluded from the analysis . when a patient had more than one episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage during the study period , only the first event was included .
additional clinical and laboratory data at presentation were retrospectively collected through review of the clinical record .
data regarding the use of prothrombinex ( pooled purified human coagulation factors ii , ix , and x ; csl ltd , broadmeadows , australia ) , fresh frozen plasma , and platelet and packed red cell transfusion were obtained from a national transfusion database .
all patients taking warfarin who had an inr of 3 or higher were included in a supratherapeutic anticoagulation ( sa ) group . 
the optmatch package in r 8 was used to match these patients to a control group of patients taken from the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage database who were not taking warfarin at presentation .
patients were matched for age , sex , pre - endoscopy rockall score , year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage , inpatient or outpatient status , and the presence of disseminated cancer at presentation .
the year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was analysed as a dichotomous variable , with patients recorded as having had an episode of bleeding in either the first or the second half of the study period .
patients were matched for year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to ensure that changes in referral patterns or in clinical management over the study period did not contribute bias to the outcome .
patients were not well matched on age and presence of disseminated cancer at presentation if the rockall score alone was used as a representative matching variable .
we elected to control confounding by using the rockall score , and not the glasgow- blatchford score , although both are validated as predictors of death in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 9 .
patients were considered to have had an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage if they had hematemesis or coffee ground vomitus , or if they passed melena per rectum .
a rebleeding event was defined as further fresh hematemesis , melena with associated hemodynamic instability ( defined as pulse rate >  100 beats / min or systolic blood pressure <  100  mmhg ) , or a drop in the hemoglobin level of 20 points or greater and hemodynamic instability subsequent to endoscopy .
demographics , baseline characteristics , endoscopic findings , and treatment administered were compared between the two groups to assess the adequacy of matching and potentially confounding factors .
student 's t test was used to compare continuous variables , and a chi - square test was used to compare categorical variables .
a p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant with the use of two - tailed testing .
the need for surgery , occurrence of rebleeding , and need for transfusion were analysed as secondary outcomes .
the study was conducted in a single regional hospital ( waikato hospital , hamilton , new zealand ) between 23rd february 2001 and 12 october 2010 . for all patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at presentation to the hospital or during an admission for a different condition , the following were recorded prospectively in a dedicated upper gastrointestinal bleed database : presenting features , endoscopic diagnosis , presence of stigmata of recent hemorrhage ( including forrest classification of peptic ulceration ) 6 
 7 and administered treatment .
those patients with evidence of variceal bleeding were excluded from the analysis . when a patient had more than one episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage during the study period , only the first event was included .
additional clinical and laboratory data at presentation were retrospectively collected through review of the clinical record .
data regarding the use of prothrombinex ( pooled purified human coagulation factors ii , ix , and x ; csl ltd , broadmeadows , australia ) , fresh frozen plasma , and platelet and packed red cell transfusion were obtained from a national transfusion database .
all patients taking warfarin who had an inr of 3 or higher were included in a supratherapeutic anticoagulation ( sa ) group . 
the optmatch package in r 8 was used to match these patients to a control group of patients taken from the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage database who were not taking warfarin at presentation .
patients were matched for age , sex , pre - endoscopy rockall score , year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage , inpatient or outpatient status , and the presence of disseminated cancer at presentation .
the year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was analysed as a dichotomous variable , with patients recorded as having had an episode of bleeding in either the first or the second half of the study period .
patients were matched for year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to ensure that changes in referral patterns or in clinical management over the study period did not contribute bias to the outcome .
patients were not well matched on age and presence of disseminated cancer at presentation if the rockall score alone was used as a representative matching variable .
we elected to control confounding by using the rockall score , and not the glasgow- blatchford score , although both are validated as predictors of death in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 9 .
patients were considered to have had an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage if they had hematemesis or coffee ground vomitus , or if they passed melena per rectum .
a rebleeding event was defined as further fresh hematemesis , melena with associated hemodynamic instability ( defined as pulse rate >  100 beats / min or systolic blood pressure <  100  mmhg ) , or a drop in the hemoglobin level of 20 points or greater and hemodynamic instability subsequent to endoscopy .
the r statistical programming environment 8 was used for statistical analysis . demographics , baseline characteristics , endoscopic findings , and treatment administered were compared between the two groups to assess the adequacy of matching and potentially confounding factors .
student 's t test was used to compare continuous variables , and a chi - square test was used to compare categorical variables .
a p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant with the use of two - tailed testing .
the need for surgery , occurrence of rebleeding , and need for transfusion were analysed as secondary outcomes .
a total of 1603 patients met the inclusion criteria , 128 of whom were taking warfarin with an inr at admission of 3 or higher ( the sa group ) .
the baseline characteristics , with the clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation , are listed in table  1 for the two groups and compared with those of all patients in the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage database .
the rate of comorbidity in the sa and control groups was significantly higher than in the unselected upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage cohort . in the sa group
, 88 patients were receiving warfarin as stroke prophylaxis because of atrial fibrillation , 17 for a prosthetic heart valve , 16 for a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation , 4 for venous thromboembolism , and 3 for other reasons .
there was a trend toward more benign endoscopic diagnoses in the sa group .  in the patients with peptic ulceration
, there was no significant difference in forrest classification between the two groups ( sa group : 10 of 42 class i , 5 of 42 class iia , 7 of 42 class iib ; control group : 13 of 56 class i , 9 of 56 class iia , 4 of 56 class iib ) . there was no significant difference in endoscopic therapy administered ( table  3 ) .
sa , supratherapeutic anticoagulation ; unmatched , unmatched cohort not taking warfarin at presentation ; asa , american society of anesthesiologists ; sbp , systolic blood pressure ; copd , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; nsaid , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug ; ppi , proton pump inhibitor.the p value represents the significance of two - tailed student 's t test for the difference between two means for continuous variables , and the significance of the difference of proportions for categorical variables .
1.5 ) was achieved in 93 of 128 patients , 79 within 48 hours and 59 within 24 hours of presentation .
warfarin was restarted in 61 of 128 patients at a median of 7.6 days ( interquartile range 3.4   
intravenous heparin was used in 17 patients for a median duration of 2.2 days ( interquartile range 2.2    4.0 days ) after presentation .
sa , supratherapeutic anticoagulation ; ffp , fresh frozen plasma . the 30-day mortality , surgery , and rebleeding rates are listed in table  5 .
the control group had a higher number of deaths due to myocardial infarction and general decline ( table  6 ) .
the excess mortality observed in the control group occurred in the first 10 days following presentation ( fig .  1 ) .  
this retrospective , observational case - control analysis demonstrates that a supratherapeutic inr at presentation is associated with a reduced mortality rate among patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage when control for comorbidity is implemented .
patients were well matched for the variables associated with mortality in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 3 
 11 , although there was a trend toward higher rates of comorbidity , higher blood urea levels , and lower hemoglobin concentrations in the sa group .  
the 30-day mortality rate of 15.5  % in the control group was significantly higher than most published figures for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and higher than the overall rate of 9.2  % for the patients in our study 12 
 13 
 14 
 15 .
this is a reflection of the degree of comorbidity in the control group of patients , in whom the mean pre - endoscopy rockall score was 3.89 .
this is comparable to the mortality rate observed in the original rockall cohort ( pre - endoscopy rockall scores of 3 and 4 , 30-day mortality rates of 11  % and 24.6  % , respectively ) 3 .  
anticoagulation was reversed at presentation in the majority of sa patients , and an inr of less than 1.5 was achieved within 24 hours in 59 of 128 patients .
anticoagulation was withheld for 30 days or longer in the majority of patients ; for some , however , the risk of thromboembolism was perceived to be high , and warfarin or intravenous heparin was commenced within this period .  
a possible explanation for the observed difference in mortality is that supratherapeutic anticoagulation produces clinically significant bleeding from lower - risk mucosal lesions .
patients can be readily treated by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to standard management ( endoscopic therapy and intravenous infusion of omeprazole ) .
a higher proportion of patients in the sa group with only gastric or duodenal erosions seen at endoscopy supports this hypothesis .
a trend toward an increased rate of surgery in the control group is also supportive .
the small number of deaths in this study precludes statistical analysis of the causes of death in a meaningful way .
it is biologically plausible that there may be a beneficial effect of anticoagulation on the cardiac circulation during a time of physiologic stress , such as during upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage .
sung and colleagues demonstrated that stopping antiplatelet therapy with aspirin during admission for acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was associated with increased mortality , and they postulated that this was due to a loss of the cardioprotective effect of aspirin 16 .
reduction in myocardial infarction due to warfarin - induced anticoagulation could be an alternative explanation for the observed difference in mortality .
factor x inhibitors ( rivaroxaban , apixaban ) and direct thrombin inhibitors ( dabigatran ) have been shown to be effective in the prophylaxis of stroke in atrial fibrillation , and in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism 17 
 18

 22 .
is the lower mortality in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with warfarin use that we have observed likely to translate to patients taking these medications ?
a major concern with factor x inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors is that in the event of acute hemorrhage , they are not readily reversible .
current therapeutic options in the setting of life - threatening bleeding include hemodialysis to remove the drug ( dabigatran ) , the administration of prothrombinex ( rivaroxiban , apixaban ) , or the administration of activated factor viia ( all ) .
there is little published experience of the clinical efficacy of these strategies , and the normalization of anticoagulation for factor x and direct thrombin inhibitors may depend on unassisted metabolism of the drug .
serum half - lives vary from 10 to15 hours 17 
 19 
 23 , a delay that may be significant in the context of an acute bleed
.   published randomized trials comparing factor x and direct thrombin inhibitors with warfarin did not specify a rate of mortality due to gastrointestinal bleeding 16 
 17 
 18 
 19 
 20 
 21 .
rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding were higher for all of these agents when compared with warfarin ; however , mortality from bleeding was lower primarily because of a reduced rate of fatal intracranial hemorrhage .
as clinical experience accumulates for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with the use of factor x inhibitors or direct thrombin inhibitors , the outcome of these patients will become clearer . because it is retrospective in nature , this analysis is subject to potential sources of bias .
the most important of these is that the inclusion of patients in the study was subject to the performance of endoscopy , and the threshold for performing endoscopy may have differed between patients taking warfarin and those not taking warfarin . however , the proportion of patients receiving blood transfusion , and the clinical and laboratory parameters suggestive of heavy bleeding at presentation ( serum urea and hemoglobin levels , pulse rate , and blood pressure ) , were similar between the sa patients and those in the control group , suggesting that the severity of bleeding was similar in the two groups .
despite high levels of comorbidity , which are known to predict a poor outcome , a supratherapeutic inr at presentation due to warfarin use was associated with reduced mortality in patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage .
reduced mortality may have been due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions , with such bleeding more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitor infusion .
alternatively , the lower mortality rate may have been due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin .","Introduction

"adult intussusception ( ai ) is a rare cause of bowel obstruction and is often associated with a pathologic lead point located in a single region of bowel .
the mechanism of intussusception is not fully understood , but it is believed to result from a lesion in the bowel wall that alters the peristaltic pattern of the bowel causing invagination . in cases where no lead point is identified , intussusception may be due to submucosal bowel edema , fibrous adhesions or dysrhythmic contractions .
the management of intussusception in adults differs from that of children , where the diagnosis is more common and treatment is based primarily on radiological reduction . surgical resection is recommended in cases of ai because it has been associated with a lead point in up to 95% of cases [ 13 ] .
however , given the abundant utilization of abdominal imaging , ai is also diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients , in which no clinical sequelae occur and surgery is not indicated .
this results in a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma , particularly in a patient with multiple simultaneous regions of small bowel intussusception .
a 41-year - old female presented with 3 weeks of intermittent crampy epigastric abdominal pain , nausea and diarrhea .
she had one episode of vomiting and lost 6 lbs over the course of 3 weeks .
the patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy using a 5 mm 30 camera and two 5 mm working ports .
six separate regions of intussusception within the small bowel were discovered between 55 and 130 cm from the ligament of treitz .
all areas of intussusception were short and witnessed to undergo spontaneously reduction ( fig . 
there was no obvious evidence of masses , adhesions or serosal abnormalities along the small bowel .
she had resolution of symptoms and had no recurrence after 3 years of follow - up .
pathologic examination of the small bowel demonstrated no evidence of malignancy , lead point , pathologic changes or sprue .
likewise , there was no evidence of acid - fast organisms , fungal or helminth parts identified .
the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes demonstrated reactive follicular hyperplasia and multifocal non - necrotizing lipogranulomas .

( a ) short segment of small bowel intussusception ( arrow ) that reduced spontaneously during laparoscopy .
( b ) a separate segment of small bowel intermittently intussuscepting and reducing ( arrow ) during laparoscopy .
management of symptomatic ai is often considered surgical because of the likelihood of identifying a lead point [ 13 ] .
however , the growing use of ct scans has led to increased detection of transient intussusceptions with no underlying disease [ 45 ] .
this is the first reported case in which multiple transient simultaneous small bowel intussusceptions have been identified intraoperatively .
short segments of small bowel intussusception appear to reduce spontaneously and do not necessarily require excision .
segments with persistent intussusception should be excised as they may contribute to symptoms of obstruction or may harbor a malignancy .

"it frequently occurs after trauma , hemorrhage , burn or abdominal surgery , which cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . without timely and aggressive therapeutic intervention ,
sirs and sepsis remain the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide , with mortality rates ranging between 30 and 70% [ 4 , 5 ] .
the initiating event in sepsis may be release of endotoxins ( i.e. , bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) ) from gram - negative and gram - positive pathogenic bacteria .
lps triggers activation of inflammatory cells , such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( neutrophils ; pmn ) , monocytes / macrophages and lymphocytes .
it is generally agreed that it is not the bacterial infection itself , but rather the inflammatory response to infection that is the predominant determinant of outcome in sepsis [ 7 , 8 ] .
one of the key features of sepsis is tissue infiltration by phagocytic cells [ 913 ] . in this scenario ,
pmn and monocytes / macrophages respond to septic stimulation by producing reactive oxygen species ( ros ) ( e.g. , superoxide , hydrogen peroxide ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) ( e.g. , nitric oxide ) .
in addition , pmn release granular enzymes ( e.g. elastase , cathepsin ) and the myeloperoxidase ( mpo)-derived oxidant , hypochlorous acid ( hocl ) .
all these components may contribute to pmn / macrophage - mediated killing of the bacteria .
however , if produced in excess during sirs and sepsis , the ros , rns and proteolytic enzymes cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction ( fig .  1 ) .
an inflammatory response to septic stimuli is crucial for host defense , because it up - regulates anti - inflammatory mediators ( e.g. , il-1 receptor antagonist , il-4 , il-10 ) and antioxidant enzymes ( e.g. , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , manganese superoxide dismutase ) .
however , excessive production of pro - inflammatory mediators in sepsis overwhelms the anti - inflammatory signaling .
this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection .
it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and may contribute to amplification of the inflammatory response [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] . in support to this hypothesis , it has been shown that septic stimuli ( e.g. , lps , tnf- ) initiate activation of transcription factors such as nfb and ap-1 , resulting in transcriptional activation of multiple genes .
this leads to the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. tnf- , il-1 etc ) , and increased expression of adhesion molecules ( e.g. e - selectin , icam-1 , vcam-1 ) and chemokines by endothelial cells [ 11 , 1719 ] .
a key role of ros / rns in modulation of the endothelial cell pro - inflammatory phenotype has been highlighted previously   ( fig .  1 ) .
given the complexity of sirs and sepsis , it is perhaps not surprising that little progress has been made in improving outcome .
efforts to block one or other component of the sepsis - associated inflammatory pathways have had little impact on patient survival .
future advances in sepsis therapy will depend on improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology . in this review
, we will focus on the early events in the response to septic stimuli of microvascular endothelial cells , the cell type that occurs in all organs .
the endothelium provides a non - adhesive and anti - thrombotic surface for blood - born components , including circulating leukocytes .
however , during sepsis , the microvascular endothelium is activated to a pro - adhesive and pro - thrombotic phenotype .
in addition , septic endothelium becomes both a target and a source of ros and rns , and it thereby contributes to the onset of organ dysfunction [ 19 , 25 ] .
clinically , sepsis is characterized by a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation .
it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ; ( ii ) increased capillary permeability that manifests as a breakdown of the microvascular endothelial barrier ; ( iii ) loss of the anti - adhesive function of endothelial surfaces ; ( iv ) coagulopathy ; ( v ) decreased density of perfused capillaries and elevated proportion of non - perfused capillaries , even in fluid - resuscitated patients with adequate arterial blood oxygenation and cardiac output [ 6 , 2633 ] .
tissue hypoxia develops because the diffusion distance for oxygen increases between blood and tissue cells .
this may explain why approximately one - third of patients with severe sepsis ( i.e. , sepsis with at least one organ failure or dysfunction ) die of organ failure even when shock is prevented by fluid resuscitation and administration of vasopressor drugs [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] .
for example , superoxide is a ros that is synthesized in endothelial cells by the mitochondrial electron transport chain , xanthine oxidase , uncoupled nitric oxide synthases ( nos ) and nadph oxidases .
bacterial bloodstream infection exposes endothelial cells to blood - borne endotoxins ( e.g. , e. coli lipopolysaccharide , lps ) and inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , interferon- , ifn ) .
the cells respond to this septic insult by activating endothelial nadph oxidases that synthesize intracellular superoxide . indeed , nadph oxidase activity is the principal source for stimulated production of superoxide in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to septic insult [ 3638 ] .
for example , in microvascular endothelial cell cultures , septic insult ( lps and ifn in combination ; lps  +  ifn ) increases superoxide levels within 2  h .
nadph oxidase evidently is the principal source because the rise in superoxide levels is abolished by nadph oxidase inhibitors ( apocynin and diphenylene iodonium ) but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration ( rotenone ) , xanthine oxidase ( allopurinol ) or nos ( l - name ) .
longer incubation ( 12  h ) with lps  +  ifn increases nadph oxidase activity and nadph oxidase protein expression .
increases in intracellular ros , whether caused by acute stimulation of nadph oxidase or by entry of extracellular ros , induce the expression of nadph oxidase subunits that subsequently assemble and produce more ros .
dismutation of superoxide forms hydrogen peroxide and nitration of superoxide forms peroxynitrite . compared to superoxide ,
both hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite are strong oxidants and the latter is also a nitrosative stressor .
thus , activation of nadph oxidase during sepsis induces oxidative and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells .
normally endothelial cells regulate vascular smooth muscle tone by basal rates of production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( enos)-derived nitric oxide and prostaglandin endoperoxide h2 synthase-1 ( pghs)-1-derived prostacyclin ( pgi2 ) . nitric oxide directly enters the smooth muscle cell and activates soluble guanylyl cyclase , thereby raising intracellular cgmp .
cgmp and camp then mediate smooth muscle relaxation . however , septic insult increases production of superoxide that reacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite that nitrates and inactivates endothelial pgi2 synthase , which can then no longer synthesize pgi2 .
superoxide may also decrease the effective cellular level of nitric oxide below that required for guanylyl cyclase activation .
nadph oxidase - derived oxidants ( i.e. , hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite ) oxidize tetrahydrobiopterin , which is a cofactor for synthesis of nitric oxide by nos enzymes [ 41 , 42 ] .
the loss of tetrahydrobiopterin ( due to its oxidation ) uncouples enos , so that the enzyme synthesizes superoxide rather than nitric oxide .
this is detrimental to blood flow in capillaries , which depends on nitric oxide synthesized locally by enos .
further , ros activate intracellular redox signaling pathways to increase adhesion of leukocytes , platelets and red blood cells to the endothelium and thereby precipitate capillary blood flow cessation [ 4446 ] . increased permeability of the endothelium occurs in multiple organs during sepsis , leading to plasma extravasation and edema formation .
this causes loss of blood volume and progression of septic shock ( i.e. , severe sepsis with hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation ) . basal nitric oxide production by enos is necessary for maintenance of the endothelial barrier function [ 4850 ] .
the protective effect of nitric oxide is diminished during the inflammatory response due to the simultaneous production of superoxide .
the source of this superoxide is likely the nadph oxidase that is co - localized with enos in subcellular compartments within endothelial cells . indeed , there is experimental evidence that nadph oxidase - derived ros mediate endothelial barrier failure .
the latter causes lipid peroxidation , oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and nitration of tyrosine residues .
in particular , nitration of cytoskeletal proteins by peroxynitrite appears to be a key step for endothelial barrier dysfunction [ 53 , 54 ] .
the oxidants that arise from nadph oxidase activity ( e.g. , hydrogen peroxide formed by dismutation of superoxide ) exert prolonged redox signaling effects that enhance induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) in septic blood vessels and endothelial cells [ 33 , 37 , 52 , 5557 ] .
inos synthesizes abundant nitric oxide that in turn reacts with superoxide resulting in an excess production of peroxynitrite .
for instance , inos expression in omental arteries of septic patients is associated with a subnormal arteriolar response to norepinephrine that can be normalized by the non - selective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) .
in addition , expression of the vascular adhesion molecule , e - selectin ( a marker of vascular pro - inflammatory phenotype ) is significantly abridged in the organs of inos - deficient mice challenged with lps ( fig .  2 ) .
important to note , that interfering with production of peroxynitrite by pretreating cultured endothelial cells with the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron [ iii ] ( fetpps ) also reduces activation of nuclear factor nfb and subsequent up - regulation of nfb - dependent expression of e - selectin ( fig . 
the oxidants produced in endothelial cells during sepsis also induce expression of tissue factor [ 30 , 60 ] . this transmembrane glycoprotein ( formerly known as thromboplastin )
because endothelial cells and monocytes do not express tissue factor under physiological conditions , there is no appreciable contact of cellular tissue factor with the circulating blood .
however , these cells do express tissue factor when exposed to inflammatory cytokines and this response contributes to coagulopathy in sepsis .
when tissue factor is exposed to blood , it forms a high - affinity complex with coagulation factors , leading to the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot .
coagulation is activated rapidly after septic insult and results in diffuse microvascular clot formation that may disrupt blood flow in capillary beds [ 28 , 30 , 60 ] .
nadph oxidase - derived oxidants also stimulate the activation of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) in endothelial cells .
normally the hif-1 subunit has a short half - life because it is covalently modified by hif-1 prolylhydroxylase , which targets hif-1 for proteolysis by the ubiquitin - proteosome system .
however , oxidants inhibit prolylhydroxylase activity and thereby allow hif-1 to dimerize with the hif-1 subunit .
the dimerization activates hif-1 to translocate to the nucleus , bind dna and promote expression of inos and other inflammatory genes [ 6264 ] .
sepsis is treated by controlling the source of infection , administering antimicrobial ( e.g. , antibiotic ) therapy , assuring hemodynamic support with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor drugs , inducing sedation or analgesia as needed ; and providing adequate nutrition . despite these interventions ,
approximately one - third of all patients with severe sepsis die before leaving hospital . therefore , the development of additional therapies is a research topic of urgent priority .
this hypothesis is based on the observation that many patients with sepsis die of organ failure despite adequate arterial blood oxygenation and cardiac output [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] .
further , survival is improved by treatments that improve microvascular function ( e.g. , antioxidants , inos deficiency , and tissue factor pathway inhibitor ) in animal models of polymicrobial sepsis [ 33 , 6770 ] . several potential therapies that target septic microvascular dysfunction are discussed next .
the administration of activated protein c ( apc ) to septic patients is a recently introduced therapy .
further , the adherence of leukocytes to arteriolar and venular endothelium is strongly diminished by activated protein c infusion , which is associated with an increased density of blood - perfused capillaries in an animal model of sirs .
apc also induces rearrangement of endothelial cells actin cytoskeleton and thereby stabilizes endothelial barrier function .
indeed , therapeutic benefit of apc in sepsis may be largely due to augmentation of endothelial barrier function .
unfortunately , any benefit from apc may be outweighed by adverse effects , especially an increased rate of hemorrhage .
a recent cochrane review recommended that apc should not be given to patients at low risk of death or to pediatric patients .
the review also concluded that the evidence supporting apc use in patients with severe sepsis and at high risk of death was very weak .
however , chemical variants of apc have been synthesized that may retain therapeutic efficacy while reducing the risk of bleeding .
experiments in mouse sepsis models , for example , show that survival is increased by a recombinant apc variant with normal cell signaling activity but < 10% anticoagulant activity .
therefore , a therapy may be developed in future that treats septic patients with apc variants that have normal cell signaling but reduced anticoagulant activities .
a second intervention that has been tested in critically ill patients is administration of the nonselective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) .
a phase iii clinical trial of l - nmma in patients with septic shock was terminated early because of increased mortality , but post hoc analysis indicated an overall survival benefit for low - dose l - nmma .
the adverse effect of high - dose l - nmma may have been due to inhibition of the enos necessary for microvascular homeostasis .
vitamin c injection is also a candidate therapy [ 26 , 78 , 79 ] . in a randomized , prospective , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial with 226 critically ill patients ,
28-day survival was increased in the patients who received combined vitamin c and vitamin e by i.v .
another large , randomized , prospective trial demonstrated decreased incidence of organ failure and shortened icu stay for critically ill patients who began receiving i.v .
injections of combined vitamin c ( 3  g / day for up to 28 days ) and vitamin e within 24  h of traumatic injury or major surgery . yet another randomized , prospective study reported decreased morbidity for severely burned patients who were infused with an even higher dose of vitamin c ( 1584 
studies of animal models have shown that vitamin c prevents lps - induced edema and hypotension [ 83 , 84 ] , prolongs survival in experimental bacteremia , and improves arteriolar responsiveness , arterial blood pressure , capillary blood flow , liver function and survival in experimental sepsis [ 26 , 3133 , 86 ] .
therefore , the biological plausibility of this intervention is discussed further in the following paragraphs .
ascorbate functions as an antioxidant and enzyme cofactor , becoming oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid ( dhaa ) in the process . sirs and sepsis lower plasma ascorbate concentration [ 26 , 31 , 8790 ] . injection i.v . of vitamin c can increase the amount of ascorbate delivered to endothelial cells to a greater extent than can oral ingestion . as depicted in fig .  4
, ascorbate is transported into microvascular endothelial cells by the specific transporter svct2 , while dhaa is taken up through facilitative glucose transporters ( glut ) and then reduced to ascorbate [ 79 , 9193 ] .
the intracellular concentrations of ascorbate thus achieved are 416  mm [ 37 , 94 ] .
this intracellular ascorbate may protect microvascular function in two phases of action : initially by inhibiting nadph oxidase activation and increasing enos activity , and subsequently by suppressing expression of nadph oxidase , inos and tissue factor ( fig . 
ascorbate in endothelial cells prevents tetrahydrobiopterin oxidation , increases tetrahydrobiopterin content and elevates synthesis of nitric oxide by enos [ 95 , 96 ] .
studies of endotoxin induced shock indicate that inos inhibition has little or no beneficial effect in the presence of a failing enos system , because some nitric oxide is needed to maintain adequate organ function .
an antioxidant role for vitamin c is supported by the observation that ascorbate abrogates stimulation by septic insult of superoxide production in microvascular endothelial cells .
intracellular concentrations of ascorbate inside cells are high enough to prevent the reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide that creates peroxynitrite   and to re - reduce the oxidation products that peroxynitrite creates when it reacts with cellular components .
intracellular ascorbate blocks induction by lps  +  ifn or hydrogen peroxide of endothelial nadph oxidase activity , nadph oxidase protein expression and inos protein expression [ 37 , 55 , 56 , 100 ] .
also diminishes inos mrna expression in microvascular endothelial cells and arterioles in an in vivo model of sepsis [ 32 , 33 ] .
ascorbate is required for the optimal activity of the proline and asparagine hydroxylases that control the transcription factor hif-1 .
expression of hif-1 sensitive genes , such as inos , is similarly inhibited by ascorbate [ 32 , 33 , 102 ] .
injection of 2  g vitamin c in human subjects does not alter superoxide production by neutrophils .
similarly , incubation of neutrophils with either ascorbic acid or dhaa , to raise intracellular ascorbate concentration , does not inhibit the production of extracellular ros elicited when these cells are subsequently challenged by inflammatory stimuli such as e. coli [ 103 , 104 ] .
there is cause for concern about potential adverse effects of high - dose vitamin c injections . under certain conditions in vitro , ascorbic acid donates electrons to transition metals ( e.g. iron ) that then catalyze the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide [ 105 , 106 ] .
is not followed by elevation of oxidative stress biomarkers in healthy human subjects , but its injection prior to surgery increases oxidative modification of plasma lipids in venous blood during the ischemic phase of surgery . because injection of high doses of vitamin c may increase the risk of hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , patients should be prescreened for this deficiency before administering i.v .
vitamin c. also , because hyperoxaluric responses may occur   and predispose susceptible individuals to nephrolithiasis , oxalate measurements are recommended during long - term vitamin c therapy . in conclusion
, therapies targeting microvascular dysfunction may have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality in sepsis .
based on the low ascorbate concentrations in septic patients , the improved microvascular function and survival observed in septic animal models injected with vitamin c , the improved outcomes observed in critically ill patients administered i.v .
vitamins c and e as adjuvant therapy , and the preservation of neutrophils capacity to produce ros during exposure to supraphysiological extracellular ascorbate levels , clinical trials of vitamin c injection as an adjunct therapy in sepsis should be undertaken .","Introduction

"upper urinary tract urothelial cancers ( uutucs ) are uncommon and account for only 5% to 10% of urothelial carcinomas
. radical nephroureterectomy ( rnu ) with excision of the bladder cuff is the gold - standard treatment for uutucs , regardless of the location of the tumor in the upper urinary tract .
it has been feared that tumor dissection during laparoscopic procedures may be associated with a higher risk of recurrence .
although this remains a matter of controversy , one randomized controlled trial , comparing laparoscopic nephroureterectomy ( lnu ) with open nephroureterectomy ( onu ) , showed that oncologic outcomes were comparable for both groups .
however , there has been no study of oncologic outcomes after lnu compared with hand - assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy ( halnu ) and onu for patients with uutuc .
to better understand the oncologic efficacy of less invasive surgery for nonmetastatic uutuc , we conducted a critical retrospective review of patients with uutuc who underwent rnu over a 15-year inclusion interval .
the objective of this study was to compare the oncologic outcomes of uutuc after lnu , halnu , and onu .
we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and demographic information of 195 consecutive patients with histopathologically confirmed uutuc treated by rnu between 1995 and 2010 at our institute .
patients with t4 disease , node - positive disease , a history of bladder cancer , or concomitant bladder cancer were excluded .
finally , a total of 108 patients with tis - t3n0m0 uutuc were enrolled in this study .
clinical information and follow - up data for the patients were obtained from the uutuc database after we received their informed consent .
all the patients underwent onu , halnu , or lnu with extrafascial dissection of the kidney , as well as complete resection of the distal ureter and its orifice .
onu was performed through a flank incision combined with a lower quadrant incision or midline incision .
halnu was performed by the transperitoneal approach with a 6- to 8-cm hand incision on the right lower abdomen in right - sided halnu and mid abdomen in left - sided halnu and 2 trocars as previously described . the hand - assisted device ( lapdisc ; hakko co , ltd chikuma , japan )
was applied to the wound , and the surgeon 's nondominant hand was inserted into the abdomen .
when the retroperitoneal approach was selected , a retroperitoneal working space was created with a pdb balloon ( covidien , mansfield , massachusetts ) . in both approaches ,
4 trocars were inserted in the usual manner . in each procedure , the kidney , the ureter , and a bladder cuff were excised en bloc .
, we have performed laparoscopic surgery in principle ( halnu in 20002002 and lnu in 2003 and thereafter ) ( figure 1 ) .
if there was wariness about performing laparoscopic surgery ( eg , because of a history of abdominal surgery or suspicion of incomplete resection of t3 upper or middle ureteral cancer ) , onu was carried out . in 98 of the 108 patients ( 90.7% ) ,
endoscopic ureteral detachment ( the pluck technique ) was carried out in 6 of the 9 halnus ( 66.7% ) and 2 of the 65 lnus ( 3.1% ) ( table 1 ) .
trends for use of each procedure of rnu for stage i through stage iii uutuc .
patient characteristics who = world health organization . computed tomography ( chest to pelvis ) , cystoscopy , and urinary cytology
were performed every 3 months in the first 5 years after rnu and semiannually or annually thereafter in patients without evidence of recurrent disease .
additional radiographic and diagnostic tests were performed when clinically indicated . at the time of the retrospective analysis ,
the median follow - up time was 60 months ( range , 6192 months ) .
postoperative adverse events ( aes ) were evaluated according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events v4.0 . cancer - specific survival ( css ) ,
recurrence - free survival ( rfs ) , and intravesical recurrence - free survival ( ivrfs ) rates were estimated by the kaplan - meier method and evaluated with the use of the log - rank test .
clinicopathologic factors in each group were compared by use of the  or kruskal - wallis test . statistical significance was set at p < .05 , and statistical tests were performed with jmp software , version 10.0.0 ( sas institute , cary , north carolina ) .
the characteristics of the patients who underwent onu , halnu , and lnu are shown in table 1 .
there was no significant difference in age , tumor site , pt stage , tumor grade , or lymphovascular invasion among the 3 groups .
the pluck technique was more frequently selected in halnu patients , followed by lnu patients in this order ( p < .0001 ) .
table 2 shows perioperative data , including the operative time , blood loss , time to discharge , and postoperative aes , for each surgical approach .
the amount of blood loss was significantly smaller in lnu and halnu patients than in onu patients ( p < .0001 ) .
the patients who underwent lnu had a shorter hospital stay than those who underwent onu or halnu ( p < .0001 ) .
there was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative aes among the groups . in the onu group , 3 cases of wound dehiscence ,
1 case of ileus , and 1 postoperative hemorrhage greater than grade 3 were observed .
the aes of grade 3 or greater in the halnu group were 1 kidney infection and 1 case of hypotension . in the lnu group ,
5 patients had postoperative aes of grade 3 or greater , including 3 cases of wound dehiscence , 1 postoperative hemorrhage , 1 kidney infection , 1 lung infection , and 1 increase in creatinine level .
figures 2 , 3 , and 4 present kaplan - meier estimates of css , rfs , and ivrfs , respectively , in each group .
the 5-year css rates of patients who underwent onu , halnu , and lnu were 74.2% , 72.9% , and 87.4% , respectively ( p = .5611 ) .
the 5-year rfs rates were 57.1% in the onu group , 12.5% in the halnu group , and 69.2% in the lnu group ( p = .0416 ) .
the 5-year ivrfs rates of patients who underwent onu , halnu , and lnu were 71.1% , 12.5% , and 69.2% , respectively ( p = .0017 ) .
multivariate cox regression analysis showed that the operative technique ( halnu ) and tumor grade ( grade 3 ) were independent factors for intravesical recurrence ( table 3 ) .
univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses for prediction of intravesical recurrence after radical nephroureterectomy ci = confidence interval ; hr = hazard ratio .
in this study there was no significant difference in css , rfs , and ivrfs rates between lnu and onu .
to date , many studies have reported that lnu is comparable with onu with regard to oncologic outcomes .
a recent cumulative analysis including 21 studies showed that lnu offered oncologic efficacy and reliable perioperative safety comparable with onu , although most of the included studies were retrospective . the cochrane collaboration 's review using comprehensive searches concluded that oncologic outcomes of organ - confined disease were comparable for lnu and onu .
only one prospective randomized study showed that lnu was superior to onu in terms of the perioperative outcomes and comparable with onu for oncologic outcomes in patients with organ - confined disease .
on the basis of these reports , the european association of urology guideline group considers that onu and lnu are equivalent in terms of efficacy in a grade b recommendation .
meanwhile , we found that halnu was comparable with onu and lnu with regard to css but was inferior to onu and lnu for rfs and ivrfs .
there are studies reporting benefits of halnu such as less intraoperative blood loss and a shorter hospital stay with an equivalent intermediate - term oncologic outcome compared with onu . in a meta - analysis of studies comparing halnu with lnu
, there were no significant differences in the operative time , the length of stay , or the risks of perioperative transfusion or complications , but halnu was associated with significantly less operative blood loss and risk of open conversion than lnu .
another study with a small series and a short - term follow - up period showed no difference in oncologic outcomes between lnu and halnu .
thus most studies reported the equivalence or superiority of halnu compared with onu or lnu .
however , a large multicenter study showed that halnu was an independent risk factor for intravesical recurrence compared with lnu , like this study . in our study
the difference in ivrfs among the 3 surgical techniques was larger than that for all rfs because the first recurrence site was the bladder in all patients who underwent halnu and had a recurrence during follow - up .
we excluded patients with unresectable or metastatic tumors because minimally invasive surgery is not recommended for advanced uutuc . to avoid contamination causing recurrence of bladder cancer itself other than intravesical recurrence of uutuc
, we also excluded patients with a history of bladder cancer or concomitant bladder cancer . in these circumstances ,
because early ligation of the ureter was not performed during rnu in our series , even in onu and lnu patients , we think that the hand manipulation during halnu might release cancer cells into the urinary tract and those cells might be seeded in the bladder mucosa .
this may mean that inexperience in using laparoscopic procedures was associated with a higher incidence of intravesical recurrence .
first , this was a retrospective study with selection biases and a small number of patients , especially in the halnu group , at a single institute . to determine the differences in the incidences of intravesical recurrence among onu , halnu , and lnu patients , a prospective randomized trial is needed .
we found that there was no significant difference in css among onu , halnu , and lnu patients but that rfs and ivrfs in halnu patients were inferior to those in onu and lnu patients .
lnu and halnu were associated with diminished blood loss , which is compatible with the results of previous studies .
patients who underwent lnu had a shorter hospital stay than those undergoing onu or halnu .
thus , we suggest that lnu is the most appropriate technique , with a balance between lesser invasiveness and favorable oncologic outcomes for patients with organ - confined disease and without a history of bladder cancer .
although there was no significant difference in css among lnu , halnu , and onu patients , halnu may be inferior to lnu or onu in terms of rfs and ivrfs .
lnu is a less invasive procedure with comparable long - term oncologic outcomes in comparison with onu .","INTRODUCTION

"
 anisakis simplex is a fish parasite of worldwide distribution , whose third stage larva can be present in a huge number of marine teleost fishes .
humans can therefore be accidental hosts by consuming crude or undercooked fish . whereas ige production is an evolutionary - maintained immunologic feature in mammals and
thus can also be verified in all cases of human parasitic forms by this nematode , the allergenic potential has been an emerging health concern in the last years , giving rise to a large number of studies searching for proteins able to stimulate a specific ige response [ 2 , 3 ] .
gastroallergic anisakiasis has been described as a differential entity , where an acute parasitism by a. simplex produces also a clinically relevant ige - mediated hypersensitivity reaction with appearance of acute urticaria , angioedema , or anaphylaxis .
it is well known that , in gaa , specific as well as total ige and other specific immunoglobulin isotype levels depend upon the time interval elapsed ( ti ) between the acute parasitic episode and the obtaining of the serum sample .
the parasite is not adapted to the human environment and neither survives nor moults to its final stage .
even if the parasitic episode is always short - lived for mainly some hours , but maximally for a few days , as has been documented by gastroscopic findings in gaa , the immune stimulation , as witnessed by its humoral response , reaches its peak after four to six weeks and ige is detectable in human sera or can be shown by skin prick tests ( spt ) for more than ten years .
another clinical entity , where a previous acute parasitic episode is suspected to play at least a necessary factor in a disease of multifactorial genesis , has been proposed to be an anisakis sensitization - associated chronic urticaria ( cu+ ) and has been described as a different phenotype of urticaria with distinct clinical as well as immunologic features with respect to other chronic urticaria forms , but also compared to gaa [ 69 ] .
furthermore , association of chronic urticaria with a. simplex hypersensitivity is now reported from different geographic regions .
therefore , even if current bibliography shows chronic urticaria to have a frequent autoimmune or idiopathic origin , the search for underlying causes or associations with infectious or parasitic disease , such as in cu+ , can be of help in research and practice .
one of the main differences with gaa , where the acute reaction points to the precise moment of the human immune system coming in contact with the nematode , is the finding of lower antibody levels in cu+ [ 8 , 12 ] .  
the experience of immune features in gaa teaches us that the allergic reaction is elicited after a secondary contact with the parasite [ 5 , 13 ] .
the important rise in immunoglobulin levels is similar to any secondary immune reaction against invading agents . on the other hand , the exact mechanisms by which acute urticaria / angioedema or anaphylaxis is elicited in gaa , compared to other parasitic forms without cutaneous or systemic hypersensitivity reaction , are not known .
moreover , the possible pathogenesis leading to chronic urticaria in sensitized patients has not been elucidated .
acute allergic hypersensitivity reactions have mainly been studied in the fields of food or insect allergy . besides the necessary production of ige induced by proteins with specific allergenic properties , several other factors are necessary to produce allergic reactions , as ige presence is not equivalent to clinical allergy .
further relevant factors could include the production of high - affinity ige or the ratio of other blocking immunoglobulin isotypes , such as igg4 [ 14 , 15 ] .
affinity and avidity studies have shown that continuous or repeated contact with antigen leads to an antibody affinity maturation .
this knowledge has led to studies differentiating acute from chronic infections [ 1721 ] .  
therefore , one approach to get more insight into the clinical relevance of specific ige and igg in a. simplex - associated allergic diseases is to assess hypothesized differences in avidity in gaa and cu+ and to associate them with the time interval elapsed since the parasitic episode and also with fish - eating habits as a possible correlation to the probability of previous subclinical parasitic episodes .
patients were recruited at our allergy service and included prospectively if they matched the inclusion criteria .
all patients had to display a positive spt and detectable ige antibodies against a. simplex at 0.7  ku / l .
gaa patients had an acute episode of acute urticaria , angioedema , or anaphylaxis of less than 48-hour duration within 24 hours after eating raw or clearly undercooked fish , and other eliciting causes have been discarded by history and allergological workup .
cu+ patients were included if they had at least twice per week recurring wheals for at least 6 weeks .
patients were not included in this study if physical stimuli were the main eliciting agents of the urticarial reaction .
other factors associated with cu were not an exclusion factor , as cu is mainly multifactorial .
thus 16 patients with gaa and 17 patients with cu+ were included and questioned about weekly fish and monthly anchovies in vinegar sauce consumption .
further time interval was defined as the interval between serum sample and gaa episode or onset of cu symptoms .
anti - anisakis specific ige , igg , and igg4 and total ige were analysed by cap - feia ( phadia , uppsala , sweden ) .
specific ige and igg against a. simplex whole body extract were further assessed by elisa .  
plates were coated with a. simplex whole body extract at 10  g / ml overnight and incubated for 30  min with 6  m urea in pbs at room temperature .
microplates were washed and blocked with bsa for 1  h. each serum was studied in quadruplicate ( 2 with urea treatment and 2 without ) , diluted in pbs - tween 20 , bsa 0.1% , and incubated for 2  h at 37c . after incubating and washing ,
two of the quadruplicate sera were treated with pbs 6  m urea for 30  min at room temperature and the remaining sera were incubated with pbs for 30  min .
after washing , goat anti - human igg and horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) conjugate ( biosource , camarillo , ca , usa ) were used . for the ige determination , a murine monoclonal antibody against an -human ige chain ( igg1 , e21a11 ; ingenasa , madrid , spain )
was added and incubated , followed by a goat anti - mouse igg ( 1 ) , hrp conjugate ( invitrogen , eugene , or , usa ) .
the reactions were developed with o - phenylenediamine with hydrogen peroxide and read at 490  nm .
the avidity index ( avigg and avige , resp . ) was defined as the mean optical density ( od ) of urea - treated wells / mean od urea - untreated wells  100 .
median values and interquartile ranges ( iqr ) were calculated for total and specific ige or igg4 as well as for avidity indexes and compared by mann - whitney u test .
we performed nonparametric correlation ( spearman rho ) studies between avige , avigg , immunoglobulins , time interval , and fish consumption .
furthermore , a linear regression was performed separately for gaa and cu+ for ige avidity as dependent variable .
we analysed specific ige , total ige , igg , igg4 , fish intake , and time interval as possible explaining variables with stepwise exclusion of nonsignificant variables .
mean time from the acute parasitic episode to the serum sample in gaa was 5.0 ( 5.2 ) months and mean duration of urticaria in cu+ was 27.0 ( 20.8 ) months .
mean number of fish meals per week was 2.7 ( 1.5 ) in all patients without differences in both studied groups . as expected , total ige as well as specific ige , igg , and igg4 was higher in gaa than in cu+ ( table 1 ) .  
median avige in all patients was 80.3 ( interquartile range 73.291.8 ) , while median avigg was 53.9 ( 37.491.8 ) .
igg avidity was higher in gaa than in cu+ ( p = 0.035 ) , whereas there was a tendency to lower ige avidity in gaa ( p = 0.095 ) .  
when analysing all patients , avigg was positively correlated with specific ige , igg , and igg4 as well as total ige ( rho between 0.66 and 0.71 ; p < 0.002 ) , but avige was negatively correlated with specific ige ( rho 0.57 ; p < 0.001 ) , specific igg4 ( rho 0.38 ; p < 0.05 ) , and total ige ( rho 0.66 ; p < 0.001 ) .
this divergent correlation depending on avige or avigg was mainly maintained when patients with gaa were analysed ( figures 1 and 2 ) . here
, a further negative correlation between avige and time interval could be stated ( rho 0.71 ; p = 0.02 ) .
also , in gaa weekly fish consumption was positively associated with avige ( rho 0.51 ; p = 0.05 ) .
linear regression showed that time interval ( p = 0.015 ) was the main explaining factor for avige in gaa ( table 2 and figure 3 ) .
  overall , we show high avidities for specific ige and moderate avidities for specific igg against a. simplex in both studied groups .
most avidity studies have been performed in order to search for differentiating recent versus chronic infections [ 1719 ] . when analysing our patients , we have to take into account that the positive skin prick test or the presence of specific ige denotes a past infection by the parasite , which is always self - limiting and therefore acute . moreover , in order to have an allergic reaction accompanying the acute gastric parasitism , as in the case of our gaa patients , they obligatorily had a previous sensitizing episode . in our cu+ , we do not know the time of the last parasitic episode , but lower ige values as demonstrated in the present as well as previous studies indicate a longer time interval to the last episode [ 8 , 24 ] . thus , it is to be expected that relevant antibodies had sufficient time to affinity maturation .
whereas in chronic infection , such as by toxocara or toxoplasma , the continuous contact with antigens facilitates affinity maturation [ 18 , 23 ] , there remains however the question about the source of antigen or allergen for affinity maturation in the case of rarely occurring acute episodes of parasitism such as by a. simplex .    in a previous a. simplex infection model in rats ,
previous studies showed that most patients with cu+ really had a past infection with a. simplex , which is supported also by high ige avidities .
we have no data on avidities after a primary infection with a. simplex in humans , as these are expected to behave subclinically or induce only gastrointestinal , but no allergic symptoms .
it may be argued that in gaa at least two episodes , as proposed above , would be sufficient to induce in the second episode a higher maturation of antibodies in the context of a secondary response , but the otherwise longer time interval in cu+ could be responsible for the slightly higher ige avidities .   whereas avidity describes the overall strength of the interaction between antibodies and their antigens , it would therefore be interesting to perform a similar study analysing affinities to already known anisakis proteins or allergens .
our avidity results could be interpreted as a subset of clinically relevant ige for the acute parasitism and a set of ige antibodies induced by continuous fish intake ( and therefore anisakis contact ) with possibly different avidities . in this respect ,
a previous study in peanut allergic subjects showed ige  :  igg avidity ratios to be higher than 1 for a total antigenic source , whereas the opposite ratio was found when analysing avidity to a major allergen ara h2 . in our present study
all but one patient showed a higher avige than avigg ( avige / avigg ratio > 1 ; data not shown ) , a fact that does not rule out opposite findings if we would have available affinity studies with known allergens .
whereas all immunoglobulin isotypes are known to be lower in cu+ than in gaa , a fact we could also confirm for specific igg in our study , avidities could also be interpreted when analysing the time interval between parasitism and obtaining of the serum sample .
likewise , regression analysis showed that , in gaa , time interval was the main explaining factor for ige avidity .
affinity is overall expected to rise in time after infection , but this probably applies to only a few relevant allergens or epitopes .
a possible explanation for our results could be drawn from the correlation studies depicted in figures 2 and 3 .
polyclonal stimulation after an acute parasitic episode leads to high immunoglobulin levels , and in the case of ige , most ige does not recognize anisakis proteins [ 2 , 13 ] .
even if we only focus on specific ige production , a mixture of high - affinity and low - affinity antibodies is to be expected . as antibody levels continuously fall again after a peak at about one month , low - affinity ige antibodies seem here to turn up over high - affinity antibodies resulting in overall lower avidity .
there is still controversy about the beneficial role of low - affinity ige antibodies . according to xiong et al .
these can compete with high - affinity ige for binding to high - affinity ige receptors and prevent anaphylaxis in atopic allergy .
otherwise this possibility has been stated unlikely because very high levels of ige are needed to adequately saturate ige receptors .
also in this case we could speculate that , once a sensitization process has occurred , following continuous contact with anisakis proteins of other specificities than those leading to the allergic episode , leads to maintaining lower affinity antibodies .
this would be an explanation to the fact that patients sensitized to anisakis do not react with acute type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in provocation tests with non viable anisakis larvae [ 28 , 29 ] .
furthermore , blocking antibodies , such as igg4 included in the igg compartment , with confirmed higher avidities in gaa could , by competing with the same epitopes recognized by ige , prevent mast cell activation and the subsequent allergic episode , when anisakis contaminated fish ( nonviable or inactivated larvae ) is well tolerated by patients with previous gaa .  
interestingly , if we look at the diverging correlation of avigg and avige with specific ige , we can also postulate that avidity is not only the outcome of an affinity maturation process of antibodies within an antibody isotype , but also the outcome of a mechanism , in which probably outcompeting of an immunoglobulin isotype over another could have been resulted by high - affinity antibodies in the maturation process .
a possible drawback of these results is of methodological concern , as there could be some controversy about the influence of igg antibodies on an elisa assay in avidity studies .
however , previous studies with using thiocyanate as denaturing agent showed independence of immunoglobulin levels and avidity and lack of independence between avidity indexes and immunoglobulin concentrations [ 26 , 31 ] .
therefore , our finding of a negative correlation of specific ige with avidity is not expected to be influenced by a methodological constraint .  
we did not show a direct negative correlation between avige and avigg , but this could be due to the fact that we did not measure differential epitope affinity and the high variation of binding capacities and maturation process of antibodies between individuals . in this respect
it is interesting to note that differences in the generation of high - affinity ige antibodies could be due to differences in sequential class switching versus direct class switching from igm , although animal models and application in human allergic disease are still a matter of debate [ 14 , 27 ] .
the specific affinity maturation in anisakis - associated allergic disease has not been studied so far , but our results could lead to a testable hypothesis , where clinically different cu+ and gaa after parasitism could be motivated by distinct class switching of specific antibodies .
in this first study on immunoglobulin avidities in humans affected by a. simplex parasitism , we could thus show a differential behaviour of immunoglobulin isotype avidities in gaa and cu+ and their dependence on fish - eating habits as well as on the time elapsed to the last parasitic episode .
further studies should address avidity studies against excretory - secretory proteins as well as affinity studies against known allergens .","1. Introduction

"as the proportion of people over the age of 55 increases in the united states , so does the uncertainty of age related changes which may impact dental treatment .
osteoporosis is said to increase the risk of tooth loss in postmenopausal women , but the mechanism remains unclear .
otherwise healthy , vibrant postmenopausal women take steps ranging from lifestyle changes ( such as improved diet and exercise ) to medications ( hormone replacement therapy and bone sparing medications ) to prevent and treat osteoporosis . both the effects of postmenopausal osteoporosis and the risks associated with the medications used to treat it have complicated decision making during the planning phase of dental implant therapy [ 24 ] .
drugs from a class of bone sparing medications , the bisphosphonates , have been associated with a condition called osteonecrosis of the jaws ( onj ) . even though the incidence of onj is recognized to be less than 0.1%
the cases are considered questionable because they have abnormal features relating to the jaws but no visible necrotic bone ( pathognomonic of onj ) such that the condition can not be fully adjudicated .
studies suggest that dental implant therapy improves esthetics and self - image [ 6 , 7 ] .
although these dental implant studies did not focus on postmenopausal women , esthetics would seem an important parameter for this cohort .
investigations by cosmetic surgeons , which do focus on postmenopausal women , confirm that as women age the focus of esthetic procedures tends towards the lower third of their face as opposed to younger counterparts who focus on skin and nose .
traditionally , dental investigations are concerned with treatment efficacy involving clinical parameters rather than individual patient perspective .
in contrast , the world health organization ( who ) recognizes the importance of oral - health - related qol within this framework through campaigns which portray not only images of pain - free living but also aesthetic images using attractive smiles as an image of enhanced well - being . as a result of this difference , recent research is refocused to consider how oral health affects far reaching aspects of life such as psychosocial interaction , self - esteem , intimacy , overall health , and performance at work . in spite of the seemingly high importance of comfort , function , and esthetics in a growing cohort of postmenopausal women dealing with osteoporosis
, the authors of this study could find no well - controlled investigation into the qol outcomes related specifically to women with dental implants .
the aim of this study is to compare the qol in partially edentulous osteoporotic women who have missing teeth restored with dental implant retained restorations with those who do not .
the current study was approved by irb ( number 2014 - 814 ) in accordance with the helsinki declaration .
all participants completed the study questionnaire freely and informed consent was implicit on agreeing to complete the written survey .
participant charts were obtained from the case / cleveland clinic postmenopausal wellness collaboration ( cccpw ) database of over 900 samples with dates of examination between january 2002 and october 2014 completed by trained panel of experts .
the selection criteria included otherwise healthy , partially edentulous , postmenopausal women having osteoporosis . for this study ,
partially edentulous participant is defined as missing more than one tooth in adjacent sites , other than a premolars or third molars , at the time of examination for entry to the database .
menopause is defined by the absence of menses for at least 1 year either naturally or surgically .
osteoporosis is defined through dual x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) scan t - score < 2.0 at either hip or spine within the last 5 years .
the score is the patient 's bone density compared with a standard norm expected in a healthy 30-year - old woman .
the t - score is the number of standard deviations away from the standard ( figure 1 ) .
exclusion criteria included validated qol confounders and are noted in the following list . after a complete cccpw database search , 237 met inclusion , did not get excluded , and fully completed the survey ( figure 2 ) .
ad hoc analysis shows that power of the study is 80% to detect a 2.1 difference in qol outcome .
exclusion criteria included the following :  greater than 4 missing teeth in one arch . 
more than one type of restoration ( implant supported , fpd , rpd ) . 
systemic conditions associated with poor acceptance of oral prosthesis were as follows :  depression .  recreational drug use
systemic conditions associated with poor acceptance of oral prosthesis were as follows :  depression .  recreational drug use
pertinent patient medical history was recovered from the cccpw chart generated by a panel of expert clinicians .
bmi , use of tobacco , hormone replacement , and bone sparing medications were recorded .
the onj condition is defined for the purpose of this study using the american association of oral maxillofacial surgeons updated definition . as such
, patients may be considered to have onj if all of the following characteristics are present : ( 1 ) current or previous treatment with antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents , ( 2 ) exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an intraoral or extra oral fistula in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for greater than 8 weeks , ( 3 ) no history of radiation therapy to the jaws or obvious metastatic disease to the jaws . as
such , the definition of onj is based on exclusion . clinical presentation of onj may take on a number of characteristics . if any of these characterizes can not be traced back by the to a known etiology , ( gingival abscess , endodontic failure , acute herpetic gingivostomatitis , etc . )
then by exclusion the characteristics are said to be associated with onj ( see the following list ) .  

clinical features of osteonecrosis of the jaws ( onj ) 
 symptoms may include the following : 
 ( a ) asymptomatic to numbness of pain 
 ( 1 ) limited to area around particular teeth . 
symptoms may include the following : 
 ( a ) asymptomatic to numbness of pain 
 ( 1 ) limited to area around particular teeth . 
( a ) asymptomatic to numbness of pain 
 ( 1 ) limited to area around particular teeth . 
( 1 ) limited to area around particular teeth . ( 2 ) around alveolar bone .
participants who met inclusion , having dental implant supported prosthesis , were compared to the subset having nonimplant supported fixed restorations , the subset having nonimplant supported removable restorations , and the subset which had no restoration of missing teeth .
participants completed the utian qol survey , a 23-question document developed to fulfill healthcare providers ' requests .
the questions contribute to a pool of items sampling across various aspects of well - being and include four basic domains : occupational , health , emotional , and sexual and together contribute to overall scores . each question
is answered on a scale of 15 , where 5 is  very true of me  and 1 is  not true of me . 
mean scores were calculated for each item and domain and the overall summary score for each instrument was calculated .
participant characteristics were compared among the groups using the kruskal - wallis and chi square tests .
qol outcomes of partially edentulous participants having implant restorations were compared to those who had fixed partial dentures , those who had removable partial dentures , and those who did not have any restoration using one - way anova with threshold of significance at p < 0.05 .
had implant retained prosthetic restorations , 60 had traditional fixed partial dentures , 47 had removable partial denture , and 66 had no restoration to restore missing teeth .
table 2 shows the utian qol survey results for 4 separate domains including occupational , health , emotional , sexual , and overall scores .
one - way anova analysis shows that there is a significant difference in each of the four domains measured in the utian qol survey and occupational , health , emotional , and sexual scores between the groups investigated .
additionally , there is a significant difference in the overall summary utian qol scores between the four groups .
this investigation was initiated to incorporate oral health into women 's health promotion and to examine psychosocial outcomes associated with dental implant supported rehabilitation .
this is the first study , as far as our authors could identify , on the subject of qol focusing solely on postmenopausal women .
this analysis compares the qol in partially edentulous osteoporotic women who have missing teeth restored with dental implant retained restorations , nonimplant retained fixed restorations , removable partial dentures , and no restoration of missing teeth . in the study of qol , demographic and medical attributes have been argued as having an effect .
this study focuses on utian outcomes ( occupational , health , emotional , sexual , and overall ) . for the purpose of complete reporting
, table 1 provides background demographic and medical data , even though statistical analysis of these background factors is beyond the scope of this study . in spite of no significant difference in age between groups
, there is a significant difference in all qol domains including occupational , health , emotional , sexual and overall qol score between osteoporotic women who have missing teeth replaced by implant supported restorations , fixed partial denture , and removal partial denture and those with no replacement of missing teeth .
although our racial sampling is not sufficient to yield statistical significance , despite similarity in racial breakdown between groups , qol is in all qol outcome measures across the 4 groups .
similarly , tobacco use is widely believed to be a long term detriment to qol ; however , in spite of this , there is a significant difference in qol outcomes in all categories measured , regardless of smoking history . because current medical literature focuses on the qol outcomes related to medications used for postmenopausal symptoms such as hormone replacement therapy and bone sparing medication use ( oral and iv bisphosphonates , selective estrogen reuptake inhibitors , and rankl inhibitors ) , use of these medications is included in the demographic patient population data .
no pathognomonic signs of onj , as spelled out in the most up to date position paper of the american association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons ( aaoms ) , were identified in any of the participants .
no clinical features , as presented in clinical features of onj list , and likewise no exposed bone of questionable origin were identified in the sampling .
of the 134 oral bisphosphonate users and 51 iv bisphosphonate users in our sampling , finding no onj case is within the expected incidence of 0.017%0.1% reported by the american society for bone and mineral research and agreed upon by the american dental association and aaoms position statement [ 13 , 14 ] .
these findings in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis support several widely held assertions revealed by previous investigations undertaken for the greater population .
the first of these is that dental implants improve qol and is shown in previous studies which compare qol between pre- versus postoral rehabilitation [ 1517 ] .
furthermore , literature suggests that tooth loss and reduced chewing ability are related to poor oral health qol   and that dental implant supported tooth replacement improves qol in improved comfort , speech , chewing function , and fit .
fpds are considered superior to and have great patient acceptance than rpds , poor diet , and unclear speech associated in the literature with rpd and edentulous patients overall may be responsible for this .
although our findings support assertions put forth in previous studies , it is important to note that these previous studies are not limited to any one cohort .
in fact , confounders such as age , gender , and kennedy classification have been suggested . for the current investigation ,
distal extension rpd patients were excluded so as to remove this potential confounder ; age is not significantly different between groups . interestingly , there is little difference between implant supported restorations versus fixed teeth supported restorations . since fixed support structures support both of these , they confer a degree of stability to the prosthesis which is not found in other cases .
outside of investigations which compare pre- versus postrehabilitation around the benefits of implant supported restoration of missing teeth , qol findings available in the literature are mixed .
in fact , the current findings which employ a point in time comparison is in contrast with the results of a recent systematic review of 53 articles which concluded that although implant supported restoration outcomes were accompanied by high patient satisfaction related to comfort , bite force , and the ability to eat more tough foods , it did not translate to better qol outcomes [ 21 , 22 ] .
another recent , point in time study compared subjective qol along with objective masticatory function in an attempt to generate a structural equation relating objective and subjective outcomes finds that perceived chewing ability is a critical factor for qol and that masticatory performance rather than food mixing ability is important for perceived chewing ability and qol .
however that investigation was limited to rpd users and did not address either implant supported or traditional fixed restorations .
it is notable that influences of qol , such as patient preferences , backgrounds , and interests , vary widely whereas singular measurements of chewing function , masticatory force , and fit , which may be more objective , do not .
furthermore , multiple studies identify gender differences in prosthesis satisfaction [ 25 , 26 ] .
the current study focuses on women only to remove the potential confounding effect of gender .
, who in a review of literature evaluating cost - effectiveness of dental implant supported versus tooth supported fixed partial denture restorations found that , for multiple missing teeth , dental implants were associated with higher initial cost , but better improvements in oral health - related qol versus other treatments .
yet another review concludes that there is insufficient extractable information regarding the tooth versus implant supported prosthesis in a partially edentulous patient . in light of inconclusive and contradictory review papers , we note that subjective patient - related factors and major determinants of qol may be easier to investigate when the study is limited to specific cohorts . as such , focusing future qol investigation on a more homogenous sample , such as ours , may be productive .
additionally , specifically validated instruments for homogenous cohorts , such as the utian survey in postmenopausal women , may be useful to study qol .
the use of a survey validated specifically for a target population separates the methodology used in the current study from previous ones .
previous studies used measurement instruments , such as oral health impact profile ( ohip ) , or a shorted version of that survey , which are generally applicable for generalizable groups .
in order to make decisions about the most appropriate treatment option in rehabilitation a dentist must understand not only the prosthetic therapeutic specifics such as chewing function and orofacial esthetics but also the patient - centered specifics of psychosocial and overall well - being .
the results of the current investigation indicate that implant retained oral rehabilitation of missing teeth has a statistically significant impact over nonimplant and traditional fixed restorations , removable restorations , and no restoration of missing teeth in far reaching areas including occupational , health , emotional , sexual , and overall qol . within the limited diagnostic accuracy of the methods used for the identification of onj used in the present work , the incidence of bisphosphonate related onj seems to be very low and supports the rate cited in the most current literature .","1.

"dolichoectatic and fusiform aneurysms represent a small subset of cerebral aneurysms and are among the most difficult to treat .
the pathophysiology of fusiform cerebral aneurysms includes a disrupted internal elastic lamina and muscle layer that might be susceptible to mechanical injury by hemodynamic strain , causing progressive attenuation of the arterial wall .
the treatment of fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery is challenging for several reasons , including the presence of perforating vessels , the proximity to the brain stem and the exiting cranial nerves , and the surgical approaches necessary to access the basilar artery .
we present the case of a patient with acute brain stem ischemic stroke who had a fusiform basilar artery aneurysm complicated by a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage .
our objective is to discuss the difficulties in the acute management of this disease , its potential treatments and complications .
a 53-year - old man with a previous history of hypertension and obesity was admitted to our emergency department with sudden right hemiplegia , hemianopsia , and dysarthria within 2 h from symptom onset .
his national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) score at admission was 19 , and he had no previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks .
the patient 's neurological symptoms progressively improved during the first hour after admission , with only a right facial palsy ( nihss 2 ) remaining .
a head ct at admission showed a hyperdense basilar artery , and a ct angiography ( cta ) confirmed a basilar fusiform aneurysm with a thrombus within the vessel and no signs of acute dissection ( fig .
he was treated with antiplatelets and transferred to our intensive care unit . due to his clinical improvement
a head ct revealed an extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and posterior fossa ( fisher grade 3 ; fig .
basilar artery fusiform aneurysms pose difficulties to treatment because , during the course of the disease , both bleeding and thrombosis can occur . in addition , bleeding may be a complication of a basilar artery fusiform aneurysm in patients initially presenting with brain ischemia , even when anticoagulation and thrombolytic treatments are not used , as happened in our patient .
fusiform cerebral aneurysms can be divided into acute dissecting aneurysms , which usually cause subarachnoid hemorrhage or cerebral ischemia , and chronic fusiform or dolichoectatic aneurysms , which slowly enlarge with time and can be asymptomatic or associated with cranial nerve dysfunction , ischemic stroke , subarachnoid hemorrhage , pseudotumor , or hydrocephalus .
although important for the treatment decision - making , the differentiation between a dissecting and a chronic fusiform aneurysm is often difficult , even with advanced neuroimaging techniques [ 1 , 4 , 6 ] . in our patient , regardless of the acute presentation of an ischemic event and posterior bleeding , no signs of dissection were seen on the cta or the mri / mra of the brain .
more than half of large cerebral aneurysms with a diameter of 20 mm or more are known to have thrombi like the one seen in our patient .
the mortality rate of patients with fusiform basilar aneurysms is approximately 70% if the basilar artery has become occluded [ 8 , 9 ] .
conversely , the occurrence of hemorrhagic events is associated with the degree of ectasia of the basilar artery .
anticoagulation therapy at conventional doses seems to increase the risk of intracranial bleeding [ 11 , 12 ] .
the role of antiplatelet agents in promoting hemorrhagic strokes in such patients is less clear .
the treatment of such lesions can be a dilemma , as in the case described . in patients with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia
considering that the current treatment risks can exceed the natural risk of basilar rupture or occlusion , a better understanding of the pathophysiology is required to help select patients at higher risk of hemorrhagic or ischemic events for invasive treatments [ 4 , 5 ] .","Introduction

"the articulated justification  or perhaps we should say rationalisation  of punishment in western countries over the past two hundred and fifty years has followed a relatively clear , and widely discussed , trajectory . to sketch this historical story only crudely : the early modern retributive corporal penalties gradually gave way , from the late 18 century , as a 
civilising process issued in a preference for less overtly violent , and less publically visible , forms of sanctioning . by the same token ,
a demand arose for the highly discretionary forms of power , through which early modern penalties were typically delivered , to be rationalised and regularised as a result of the gradual modernisation and democratisation of the hierarchical forms of political authority from which they emanated .
beccaria and bentham are , with good reason , thought of as the key figures in this modernisation of the rationale of punishment , though beccaria is of particular importance in that his work stands as an important modern source of both of the two main ideas which have coincided and competed with one another as justifications of state punishment .
these are , first , the  neo - classical argument that punishment is in some sense a morally appropriate equivalent to an offence , and is thus constrained by the requirement of proportionality ( an argument to be found in pure retributive form in the work of , for example , kant , who further saw the imposition of deserved punishment as obligatory rather than merely permissible ) ; and , second , the utilitarian argument that punishment , as a prima facie evil , can only be justified by countervailing good consequences , achieved through specific or general deterrence , incapacitation , rehabilitation , restitution or moral education ( an argument most rigorously worked out by bentham ) .
the ideas that punishment is in some deep sense retribution for a blameworthy act or an institutionalised expression of affective blame , and that an offender s blameworthy conduct is what justifies punishment , have deep historical roots . yet
the fortunes of retributive theories of punishment based on culpability  blameworthiness in the sense of responsibility for wrongful conduct  have been mixed , particularly since the development of consequentialist justifications for punishment , from the writings of cesar beccaria and jeremy bentham to the present day .
but a brief review of the relative fortunes of retributive and consequentialist rationales is useful in identifying the precise misunderstandings about the concept of proportionality as the modern expression of the retributive ethic , and about its capacity to anchor punishment within clear limits , to which we want to draw attention .
until the 18 century , what we might call a retributivism of symbolic equivalence dominated both the theory and practice of punishment in most of europe . to focus on england as an example , a panoply of ( to our eyes ) harsh corporal and social penalties  branding , maiming , whipping , pillorying , the use of the branks or 
scold s bridle and , ultimately , capital punishment  were deemed equivalent to the relevant offence , and inflicted in public , hence reinforcing spectators apprehension of that equivalence . in a pre - democratic world , the moral logic of the lex talionis   an eye for an eye 
  appears to have struck a deep chord , not least because of the resonance between penal authority and various christian doctrines .
indeed the idea that penalties should be measured and proportionate finds its origins in the ecclesiastical law practice of imposing graduated fines  a practice in stark contrast to princely , secular early modern penalties , in which the monarch s power to punish or to pardon through an exercise of 
grace was the antithesis of the classical aspiration to mete out even - handedly a  just measure of pain. a robust form of retributivism  the idea that the application of a deserved penalty is , a priori , a self - evident good barely requiring justification , indeed something which is morally required  appears not to have posed significant problems of legitimation .
it is only from the middle of the 18 century that this self - evidence of punishment seems to have been under challenge .
they include the emergence of more egalitarian and democratic ideas in europe and north america ; the growth of sentiments opposed to the public display of violence ; and the growing regulatory ambitions of a more organised state . for both moral and prudential reasons ,
the banal violence of the early modern penalties began to be questioned , and the seeds of a reformed penal system , focused not only on doing justice but also on disciplining the subjects of punishment in a more systematic way , notably through the modernisation and expansion of the prison , were planted .
but the declining self - evidence of the ancien rgime in punishment may , ironically , also have had to do with the attempted rationalisation and modernisation of retributivism which beccaria s ( and kant s ) philosophy exemplified , with the growing acceptance that punishment required abstract moral justification itself a reaction to the declining force of early modern symbols of equivalence largely expressed through physical punishments . in particular , the recognition that desert is calibrated not only with the offender s misconduct or manifested bad character but , importantly and additionally , with the degree of the offender s responsibility , disrupted any simple symbolism of equivalence .
this was not , of course , in the nature of a clean break from retributivism to utilitarianism ; in particular , religious overtones to punishment as a form of atonement persisted .
penitentiary , and early prison regimes were strongly focused on encouraging the offender to reflect on his or her wrongdoing and come to a state of repentance 
an idea which it was possible to bring into conformity with the utilitarian goals of discipline and reformation which were becoming so influential .
conversely , many pre - modern penalties  branding and whipping for example  must surely have had incapacitative and deterrent rationales and effects alongside their retributive foundations .
but as the 19 century wore on , the moral project of modern imprisonment became increasingly tied up with the calculation of its consequences : initially with more discourses focused on deterrence ; then on identifying , through social darwinist ideas and , ultimately , lombrosian criminology , certain 
types in need of moral re - education or incapacitation ; and , into the 20 century , with a welfarist philosophy applied to the rehabilitation of offenders .
the first two thirds of the 20 century have been , aptly , characterised in garland s influential work as a period in which punishment in most advanced democracies was increasingly constructed in welfarist terms .
while punishment was certainly viewed as an appropriate state reaction to wrongdoing , and the panoply of responses deployed by most democratic societies included a range of severe sanctions , often including capital punishment , the infliction of hard treatment was tempered by a distinctively welfarist or ameliorative spirit .
probation and the development of various forms of training for young offenders were early signs of this penal welfarism . and
after the second world war , particularly in countries like britain and the united states , a distinctive form of penal welfarism  widely known as the rehabilitative ideal  established itself as a central rationale for state punishment .
punishment was justified by appeal to its potentially rehabilitative consequences ; and the variety of ameliorative and even therapeutic programmes and  treatments burgeoned .
the penal practices and articulated penal policies and principles of national governments , of course , typically exhibit a mixture of potentially philosophically incompatible elements such as general and special deterrence , incapacitation , reform , denunciation , reprobation and retribution . so one should not exaggerate the completeness with which a welfarist or rehabilitative ethic prevailed across penal practices of the countries which followed the welfarist path .
but it did , undoubtedly , enjoy a period of dominance ; and , just as clearly , its influence declined as a result of a decisive change in public penal philosophy from the 1970s on .
as recently as 1968 , h. l. a. hart , in his postscript to punishment and responsibility , reflected something approaching a liberal consensus when he remarked that 
few people would now advocate so thoroughgoing a variety of retribution as the pure retributive view which regards the return of suffering for moral evil voluntarily done [ as ] itself just or morally good , let alone the further kantian view that such punishment is not merely morally permissible but morally obligatory . while hart accorded some respect to the argument that the value of punishment consists in  the authoritative expression  of moral condemnation for the moral wickedness involved in the offence  an institutionalised communication of resentment  the idea that returning suffering for evil is intrinsically good is regarded as  a mysterious piece of moral alchemy or  a primitive confusion between punishment and compensation .
the prevailing sense of hart s book is a confident liberal consensus that while consequentialist approaches to punishment could be abused and subject to excesses , and that adequate limits on the distribution and quantum of punishment were a key concern , pure retributivism was a thing of the past . yet a mere 20 years after the publication of hart s influential collection , the retributive tradition , repackaged as the  just deserts movement or the 
justice model , had captured the imagination of both policy makers and penal philosophers in the usa , the united kingdom and many other countries .
the reasons for the demise of the rehabilitative ideal are well known , and we will not rehearse them in any detail here .
first , the rehabilitative ideal led to a rise in lengthy indeterminate sentences based on predictions of  dangerousness or need for treatment , and implied broad and unaccountable official discretion as to release date , based on expert judgments about prognosis , risk and  cure. alongside this concern with executive discretion sat a civil libertarian concern about the capacity of indeterminate sentencing to violate offenders rights .
the concern to establish respect for agency and responsibility as core values of the criminal process was not , of course , restricted to proponents of  just deserts , it also characterised theories which seek to combine backward - looking and forward - looking considerations in the justification of punishment .
but the justice model successfully presented itself as the approach best able to generate an account of punishment compatible with both full respect for offenders as agents and the modern ambition to achieve even - handedness , constrained discretion and  most important to our argument in this paper  limits on state punishment .
the limiting principles celebrated by the justice model are underpinned by the further claim that a certain proportionality can be built in to the quantum of punishment ; and that this in turn is guaranteed by the backward - looking orientation of punishment s justification .
the idea that punishment is conditioned on , and responds to , blameworthiness implies that the punishment must be proportionate to it .
it was therefore widely assumed  and hoped  that the proportionality implied by desert would provide clear limits on punishment .
by linking not only the justification but the distribution and quantum of punishment to the offender s desert , in the sense of the level of blameworthiness appropriately to be attached to the offence , the justice model appeared to offer a clear limit on the extent of the state s right to punish , and presented itself as a progressive , humane and liberal approach .
this aspiration is , however , very far from having been universally realised in practice .
thirty years on , the practical impact of the justice model presents a mixed picture , and in liberal market countries such as england and wales , scotland , australia , new zealand and  most spectacularly  the united states , the scale of punishment has increased relentlessly . this penal 
grade inflation has a number of different dimensions , of which we here mention only the most obvious .
the imprisonment rate per hundred thousand of the population has soared , as a result of both increasing flows of defendants through the criminal courts and a rise in sentence levels , particularly for certain categories of offence .
mandatory sentencing systems have become a common feature of these liberal market systems , and many of the sentencing guideline systems designed to foster the determinacy sought by the justice model in fact led to longer sentences as a result of the political choice to structure them around very high tariff scales , and to reduce judicial discretion to temper sentence severity .
in addition , prison conditions in many of these countries have deteriorated , with not only overcrowding but also deliberately punitive and restrictive regimes ousting longstanding ameliorative programmes focused on education , vocational training , drug and alcohol treatment , and therapeutic interventions . finally , stigmatising post - sentence conditions and disqualifications , which are inimical to reintegration , such as disenfranchisement , placement on offender registers , and ineligibility for certain jobs and public benefits , have been , particularly in the united states , on the rise . furthermore , a number of countries in which the justice model had the most decisive influence on policy  notably the united states and england and wales  have also seen a continuation or even acceleration of practices , such as indeterminate sentencing and preventive justice , which were thought to express the more extreme injustices and disrespect for the rights and agency of the offender that characterised the rehabilitative ideal , in principle and in practice .
it turns out , as jeffrie murphy has put it , that retributivism has two faces : one oriented to justice and respect for responsible agency ; the other oriented to vengeance and to moral emotions such as resentment , anger and other hostile , negative attitudes typical of affective blame , which when allowed to issue in what murphy calls 
deep character retributivism can easily rationalise severe and  othering penalties . and appeals to 
proportionality have little limiting potential here , for while empirical studies indicate a noteworthy degree of consensus , even across different countries , on the relative seriousness of standard offences  so - called 
ordinal proportionality  they reveal no such consensus about what this implies in terms of what penalty is suitable 
core areas of criminal law , appeals to ordinal proportionality may therefore provide some basis for institutional arrangements such as sentencing guidelines ; and indeed the various programmes of sentencing reform launched in many jurisdictions in the wake of the just deserts movement provide plentiful examples of successful institutionalisation of stable relativities between penalties .
but the lack of any comparable consensus about cardinal proportionality implies that appeals to proportionality are , under current conditions , unlikely to be a successful basis for institutionalising substantive criteria of a punishment s  fitness  hence , as we argue , rendering the appeal to proportionality chimerical as a basis for limiting punishment . in the light of this difficulty , it is therefore not surprising that many desert theorists have focused primarily on ordinal rather than cardinal proportionality .
but the very idea that a certain punishment is deserved  and with it , the whole basis for proportionality s purported capacity to set upper limits on , or to generate substantial criteria of fittingness of , punishment  rests on cardinal rather than ordinal proportionality . strikingly , in other countries which also moved towards sentencing guidelines and a range of institutional arrangements counselled by the justice model s version of neoclassical retributivism , which emphasises the importance of responsible agency  notably sweden and the other nordic countries  the increase in the scale and intensity of punishment has been less marked . clearly , both trends in crime and in public concern about crime , as well as distinct penological traditions and sentencing institutions , are at issue here .
but the very different impact of the justice model in different countries raises important questions about the cultural , political , social and institutional conditions under which the retributive revival invites an escalation of insatiable affective blame , and those under which it fosters  or can be made consistent with 
it raises questions , in short , about the cultural and institutional arrangements which can make the metaphor of proportionality meaningful , and punishment accordingly limited in real terms .
in addressing these questions , a useful place to start is by looking at certain features of the penal systems which predated the modern push towards consequentialism in punishment , or which continue to exist in parts of the world whose penal practices were less decisively affected by the processes of modernisation and democratisation which swept europe and the united states in the 18 and 19 centuries . in many of their earlier forms , retributive ideas related to wider frameworks of social and ethical meaning which underpinned prevailing social and political systems and institutional practices
 an environment which had fundamentally changed by the time attempts were made , in the 1970s , to revive and realise retributive ideas .
an effort to understand the nature of the lost cosmology which leant meaning to early modern punishments  impressionistic as it must be within the confines of a single paper 
may , we suggest , help to explain such capacity as they enjoyed to institutionalise a practice of retributive punishments within clear limits , the very 
distance of the examples helping us to think more imaginatively about how the legitimation of penal practices is shaped by prevailing interests , institutions and ideas .
both the historical and the conceptual foundations of retributivism are generally associated with the lex talionis . taking this as our core example therefore  while bearing in mind the analogies with other systems such as the corporal penalties typical of the early modern criminal justice systems of europe and the system of penalties prescribed by sharia law  we would suggest that early systems of retributivism had at least three distinctive features key to their legitimation and stability .
the first was a social ontology of status hierarchy which rendered the legitimation of punishment a far less pressing issue than it is in liberal societies which place a high value on individual autonomy , and which prescribed different forms of penalty calibrated with social class and oriented to widely understood marks of degradation .
this was manifested in either religious doctrines of damnation , expiation , atonement , penitence and so on , or a vision of political authority marked by symbols of supra - human or highly particular human authority such as the  divinity or 
majesty , implying the princely power not only to punish but to pardon through the exercise of  grace. the third was what we will call a shared symbolism of equivalence .
of course , few systems have attempted to enact literally the symbols of cardinal proportionality contained in the lex talionis .
but the fact is that , to contemporaries , prescribed punishments in many early modern systems related in some intuitively meaningful way to the wrong done ( and typically did so independently of any psychological judgments of responsibility which complicate assessment of culpability in modern desert theory , and which emerge alongside modern , psychological conceptions of selfhood ) .
each of these conditions made it possible to coordinate the expectations of the relevant actors so that they were in agreement on not only the need for a penal response , but equally the appropriate shape which that response might take .
if we look back to the early modern english penalties which seem so cruel , horrifying and indeed disproportionate today , we can nonetheless acknowledge that they found their form , and took their place , within a composite view of political authority which itself drew on symbols , doctrines and common values , as well as being stabilised by a rigid status hierarchy and an authoritarian system of governance  conditions which also applied , of course , to the church , whose panoply of graduated fines represents a fascinating precursor to modern conceptions of proportionality .
this was , of course , by our standards an unduly hierarchical and undemocratic world ; and the rituals which elaborated different forms of capital penalty , as well as the different forms of corporal penalty such as branding , pillorying and so on , strike us , for good reason , as deeply inhumane .
moreover the idea of punishment before the public gaze  a key condition for the diffusion of shared perceptions of symbolic equivalence  is now regarded as fundamentally uncivilised .
but it is worth remembering that the world view from which these penal practices proceeded was one in which the symbols of state and penal authority formed part of a broader cosmology of authority and right , itself often bound up with claims about divine or traditional legitimation , and one which commanded respect well beyond the elite .
consider , for instance , the widespread popular participation in the drama of the scaffold  not only as crowds witnessing executions , but as consumers of many forms of popular culture .
these include the criminal autobiographies which , in the form of defoe s moll flanders , finally transmuted into an early form of the realist novel ; the newgate ordinary s widely read reports on the spiritual condition and conduct of the condemned in the run - up to execution ; and the street ballads and pamphlets which were preoccupied with not only the drama of justice being done but also the condemned offender s reception of the punishment . often  and , within this literary genre , ideally  such reception included scaffold speeches that consisted of confession and penitence , transforming execution into a potential scene of redemption within christian cosmology .
indeed , many historians accounts of the behaviour of the scaffold crowd and of the choreography of the procession and execution process suggest that the offender s confession was key to the successful enactment of what amounted to a highly ritualised  and cathartic 
with which punishment was meted out , all the participants had a part to play in the script .
the vision of legitimate power and authority which underpinned the early modern english penal system did not , of course , consist only or even primarily in christian doctrines : here as in other early ( and some existing ) systems , social codes of honour and status were also important .
but there can be little doubt that this world of widely shared deference to authority , and vision of authority as vested with , broadly , sacred significance 
majesty  made a certain sense of penal practices , constituting penality as one among many social rituals in which that hierarchical authority was enacted . within this system of meaning and the prevailing cultural , moral and political economy , as douglas hay has persuasively argued , prerogatives such as pardoning and mercy , highly discretionary and unevenly applied though they were , made sense .
but , as the source and form of political authority has been subject to a process of systematisation and rationalisation in the construction of the modern nation state , older forms of ordering and of meaning - making have been eroded .
equally important , the symbolism of equivalence which underpins the lex talionis , sharia justice , or the corporal and capital penalties perhaps most vividly exemplified by foucault s famous portrayal of the execution of the regicide damiens in the opening pages of discipline and punish have , for the majority of those living in western countries , lost their persuasive appeal .
but to contemporaries , not only the complex dramaturgy represented by spectacular penalties such as that of damiens , but more routine corporal penalties such as maiming and branding , related in some intuitively meaningful way to the wrong done .
the effort to build a modern equivalent to the lex talionis has long taken the form of appeals to proportionality .
indeed , thomas jefferson s 1778 bill for proportioning crimes and punishments in the early formation of the united states combines the appeal to proportionality with a continuing commitment to talionic punishments to a striking degree : 
 whosoever on purpose and of malice forethought shall maim another , or shall disfigure him , by cutting out or disabling the tongue , slitting or cutting off a nose , lip or ear , branding , or otherwise , shall be maimed or disfigured in like sort : or if that can not be for want of the same part , then as nearly as may be in some other part of at least equal value and estimation in the opinion of a jury  
 in the neoclassical revival of the late 20 century , the appeal to proportionality tended to be realised rather in the technical form of procedural mechanisms such as sentencing guideline systems .
but the stark fact is that those systems produce staggeringly different judgments of what counts as a  proportional penalty for , say , theft , rape or manslaughter , in countries such as sweden on the one hand and the usa on the other  countries which , for all their differences , share many features of political and social culture and economic development .
moreover there are significant differences between what is now considered proportionate within particular countries as compared with 40 years ago  as exemplified by the emergence of mandatory sentencing in many jurisdictions , notably the united states and england and wales .
we now live in a world which has largely moved away from attachment to physical symbols of penal equivalence , from the established markers of status hierarchy which underpinned deference to established political authority as such , and from a view of political authority as invested with sacred power  all features which contributed to the stabilisation of criteria of 
the modern answer to the ( unappealing ) pre - modern equilibrium is an appeal to proportionality .
but such an appeal can in itself contribute little to the construction of norms adequate to limit state punishment .
indeed , proportionality represents an intuitively shared starting point precisely because it is virtually indeterminate in its substantive implications : in other words , it simply defers the crucial and complicated processes of meaning - making , consensus - building and institutional development .
whosoever on purpose and of malice forethought shall maim another , or shall disfigure him , by cutting out or disabling the tongue , slitting or cutting off a nose , lip or ear , branding , or otherwise , shall be maimed or disfigured in like sort : or if that can not be for want of the same part , then as nearly as may be in some other part of at least equal value and estimation in the opinion of a jury 
to modern readers , the suggestion that there is anything to be learnt of relevance to penal reform today from early modern penal systems , let alone that such systems were better able to fix conventional values on punishment which were in some sense  proportionate or 
our implicit self - understanding , in both our penal thinking and our political thinking , is that the last three centuries have been , albeit with horrifying setbacks , an era of progress and of increasing civilisation , not least in our practices of punishment . that progress is associated with a recasting of what we might call the cosmologies , or systems of symbolic meaning , which animated and legitimised older practices of punishment and state authority , as atavistic , pre - modern , part of the ancien rgime . in the process of modernisation ,
those symbolic systems were either fully rejected as irrational or uncivilised , or demoted in political importance .
but if they were indeed important in calibrating , legitimising and stabilising punishment , efforts at penal reform may have been hindered by a failure to appreciate their role or to acknowledge the impossibility of reviving them by an act of political will .
the neoclassical aspiration was to create modern mechanisms for fixing cardinal as well as ordinal proportionality ; but the impact as well as the shape of such mechanisms has varied decisively even among otherwise comparable countries .
this raises questions about the implications of the value pluralism and heterogeneity typical of individualistic and secularised western democracies , and particularly in the competitive political systems of the liberal market economies such as the united kingdom and the united states , for our efforts to garner consensus about appropriate limits on punishment under contemporary conditions .
a useful goal is therefore to work towards an understanding of the institutional conditions and broader social arrangements under which a successful orientation to limited punishment and to reconciliation may be stabilised . in this section
we begin this task , arguing that this capacity is greatest where  by broad analogy with early modern systems 
appeals to proportionality connect with a larger shared frame of common meaning and consensus about legitimate authority ; and where they take place within a social and institutional context in which the relevant actors share expectations of both interdependence and the ability of social norms and institutions to coordinate effective cooperation between them in the medium to long term .
first it draws on work in evolutionary psychology which explores the significance of two contrasting standard responses to exploitative behaviour : vengeance and reconciliation ; and which draws a clear distinction between the evaluation of the level of seriousness of offence and the choice of response . as we shall argue below
, this research has some interesting implications for our efforts to understand why some modern social orders seem better able to institutionalise moderation in punishment than do others .
second , our thesis draws on several paradigms in comparative political economy which have developed models of distinctive social , economic and political systems with differential capacities to coordinate behaviour , motivate consensus , and be guided by an orientation to long term relationships between members . focusing on the implications of these literatures in evolutionary psychology and in the comparative political economy of varieties of capitalism , political systems and welfare regimes , we aim to produce an analysis of the political , social and institutional conditions which are most likely to stabilise and moderate the conventions of proportionality in punishment .
literature in evolutionary psychology ( as well as in game theory ) has explored the ways in which group members react to hostile conduct and how these impact on relationships and group dynamics .
retaliatory responses aim to reduce motivation to exploit others by imposing a cost and thereby adjusting the expected benefit of any hostile conduct for the aggressor in future .
reconciliatory responses , in contrast , aim to reduce motivation to exploit others by seeking to restore cooperative relationships , thereby preserving the possibility of mutually beneficial interactions between group members in future .
retaliation protects against future exploitation only in so far as the aggressor fears getting caught and so being subjected to retaliation : it fosters no intrinsic desire to end hostilities in the aggressor ; indeed , it may undermine any such desire and hence increase aggression . the success of retaliation as a response therefore depends on adequate monitoring of the aggressor and possession of the power to effectively harm them in turn .
reconciliatory responses demand a willingness to forgive the aggressor and wipe the slate clean for the sake of future mutually beneficial relations .
reconciliation aims to foster an intrinsic desire in the aggressor to end hostilities by eliciting remorse and recognition of the value of the relationship .
reconciliatory responses do however risk leaving the forgiving party vulnerable to future exploitation , if the aggressor deceives them about their commitment to avoid hostilities and maintain good relations . nonetheless ,
from the long - term perspective , reconciliatory responses are optimal when successful , for they reduce the risk of the aggressor perpetrating harm without incurring the cost of monitoring and the maintenance of coercive power in the future , while bringing the benefit of maintaining relationships so far as possible . conditions that foster both the likelihood and the viability of adopting a reconciliatory response include : being in a kin relationship ; recognition of the aggressor s work or other social productivity ; the aggressor s remorse or repentance ; and the mutual dependence in various forms of the aggressor and other members of the group . within evolutionary psychology , these conditions are understood as pertaining in one way or another to perception of the aggressor s 
associational value : in other words , the value which can be expected to derive from future interactions with them . where associational value is high , the orientation to forgiveness and reconciliation is accordingly enhanced ; where it is low , either because of features of the aggressor themselves or the relationship they have with members of the group  or , as we shall suggest below , features of the socio - political environment  the orientation to retaliation will be stronger .
evaluations of how to react to a hostile act , holding evaluations of its seriousness constant , are accordingly shaped by associational value : by the expected value of future interactions with the offender .
the associational value findings suggest that countries with higher levels of social solidarity and trust will be those in which it is easiest to create institutions and practices oriented towards reconciliation and hence to moderate retributive excess ; and that it may be harder to generate barriers to retaliation and escalating aggression , and incentives to reconciliation , in large scale , anonymous , urbanised societies , where confident evaluations of high future associational value are harder to make .
indeed , comparative sociological evidence supports this suggestion , in that the countries which have experienced the most dramatic increase in punitiveness over the last 40 years are those with the lowest levels of solidarity and trust and the highest levels of heterogeneity along a range of social indicators .
more systematically , there may well be important social and institutional differences which structure the incentives and capabilities towards retaliatory versus reconciliatory reactions to crime . and
it is here , we would argue , that evolutionary psychology research resonates with three related models in comparative political economy : hall and soskice s characterisation of  liberal and  coordinated  varieties of capitalism ; esping - andersen s characterisation of  three worlds of welfare capitalism ; and lijphart s characterisation of competitive versus consensus - oriented political systems .
although a full and detailed exploration of these resonances is beyond the scope of a single paper , the main points of connection may readily be sketched .
as we have seen , the notion of proportionality generates in itself no concrete limits to punishment ; hence the question of how much  and indeed how  to punish remains open to the sway of convention , political decision , or expediency .
prevailing conventions ; the institutional structures within which they develop , and within which penal policy is formulated ; and the quality and intensity of social relationships , themselves premised in part on conventions and institutional structures , accordingly become crucial to the construction of meaningful limits on punishment .
liberal market countries , which have in recent years moved to increasingly flexibilised economies , do not invest heavily in their members skills . in these countries ,
labour market conditions typically produce a high proportion of short - term and insecure jobs and , significantly for our argument , their heavy reliance on monitoring to secure compliance is reflected in strikingly high levels of 
guard labour. the conditions for establishing high future associational value  and for evaluating it with any confidence  would therefore seem to be weaker in liberal market economies than in coordinated market countries . for coordinated economies comparative advantage
is built on long term investment in their members skills , an investment itself premised on the expectation of long term relationships of cooperation and mutual dependence between different groups .
and these relationships help to foster intrinsic motivations for compliance with prevailing social norms ( at least among insiders  an important caveat when it comes to penal policy ) .
the coordinated market economies , moreover , typically feature the more generous welfare systems which , particularly in their nordic , social democratic form , represent a recognition of mutual interdependence and belonging and express a culture of solidarity which fosters trust relations ( and which is strongly correlated , as shown by comparative research , with lower levels of punishment ) .
these welfare systems , one might say , represent an institutionalisation of the collective expectation that associational value between citizens will  and indeed ought to  be high and widespread . moreover , we might expect associational value to be weaker  and hence the appeal to proportionality ( or other metaphors aspiring to limit punishment ) a less effective constraint on retributive reactions  in the countries with highly competitive , first - past - the - post political systems , where policy horizons tend to be relatively short term and policy platforms accordingly volatile , than in the consensus - oriented political systems typical of the northern european and nordic countries .
for , in the latter countries , policy horizons tend to be longer term as interests within a proportionally representative system have to be bargained out in the process of coalition - formation : voters can accordingly have some confidence in the credibility of the policy platforms on which parties stand for office .
it follows that these political systems not only depend on , and set up incentives encouraging actors to , compromise , but also foster the sort of stability and group cohesion which underpins greater expected associational value .
their capacity to limit punishment , in short , is dependent not on abstract appeals to proportionality but on social and political cohesion which fosters high associational value between citizens and hence an orientation towards reconciliation  conditions which are met to a greater degree in the coordinated systems of northern europe and the nordic countries than in the anglo - saxon , liberal market countries .
in other words , the psychological conditions which foster an orientation to reconciliation , through sustaining dense networks of mutual associational value , are better institutionally supported in coordinated market economies whose production regimes are premised on investment in long term relationships ; in proportionally representative , consensus - oriented political systems in which there is a longer time frame for policy making ; and in social democratic welfare systems which symbolise mutual dependency and which foster solidarity and relatively low levels of social inequality . to put this explicitly in terms of the associational value model set out above , a well coordinated labour market within a society
in which mutual dependency and solidarity are also reflected in generous welfare state arrangements supports recognition of an aggressor s work or other social productivity and expresses , at the level of the polity , an analogue of kinship relationships at the interpersonal level ; the proportional political representation of all sectors creates both mutual dependency and stability which enhances expected associational value ; and mutual dependence and a prevalence of long term relationships within both economic and social relations prima facie seems likely to enhance the scope for both expectation of and effective communication of remorse or repentance , so as to preserve those relationships .
the perfect conditions for forgiveness and reconciliation , like durkheim s ideal  conscience collective , exist nowhere .
but the institutional structure of different societies has a decisive impact on the extent to which they can be constructed , by affecting the opportunities and incentives of key actors such as judges , prosecutors , police officers , victims of crime  and indeed all of us who vote on criminal justice policy .
the importance of trying to understand the nature of this institutional impact can hardly be exaggerated .
the question of what shapes the balance between retaliation and reconciliation has long been recognised by sociologists , anthropologists and criminologists as a crucial question about punishment . even those who , like g. h. mead , see desert as the basic reason for punishment , and the expression of vengeance and affective blame as socially useful , acknowledge that these generate no stable criteria for the level of punishment , and so inevitably carry the risks of the escalation of aggression and of the stigmatisation of offenders . as mead put it :  we see society almost helpless in the grip of the hostile attitude it has taken towards those who break its laws and contravene its institutions ; and , in a passage reminiscent of durkheim ;  hence  the attitude of hostility , either against the transgressor of the laws or against the external enemy , gives to the group a sense of solidarity  which consumes the differences of individual interests , the price paid for this solidarity of feeling is great and at times disastrous. in the sway of these powerful emotional dynamics  recently seen perhaps most vividly , among advanced democracies , in the united states 
appeals to proportionality are little more than empty rhetoric . what is needed , rather , is an understanding of the institutional conditions which can structure the dynamics of collective action so as to inhibit the slide into stigmatisation and othering , and foster the reconciliatory dispositions .
a certain form of retributivism , then , in the sense of a set of stable and effective criteria defining the fittingness of penalties by reference to a particular offence by a particular offender , makes most sense within the cosmology , or moral economy , in which state penalties are enacted within , and widely regarded as integral to , a political system rooted in a symbolically legitimated status hierarchy .
moreover the legitimation of those penalties may be underpinned in some important ways by theological symbolism and various forms of religious doctrine and belief .
early modern punishments look to us crude and extreme expressions of revenge ; but their meaning to contemporaries  notably to the spectators at the scaffold or to the consumers of the forms of popular culture mentioned earlier  was importantly premised on an afterlife , on expiation , on a symbolism of penitence . and they resonated with moral sensibilities in a less violence - averse and a more overtly status - based hierarchical world than ours .
a world no longer organised around a moral order structured in terms of symbolically anchored notions of desert or appropriateness 
there is no agreed mechanism for anchoring the penalty scale according to cardinal proportionality , and actual penalty scales are driven by convention , calculations of consequences , and political dynamics . particularly under conditions of a highly politicised climate for criminal justice policy - making
, the commitment to just deserts all too easily produces insatiable demands for hard treatment .
desert theorists believed that retributivism could provide a limit to punishment by restricting its moral justification to the past - oriented criterion of proportionality with the seriousness of an offence .
that its credentials on the first criterion are dismal is not surprising given that our prevailing culture is no longer premised on widely shared belief in a moral order structured around notions of desert or appropriateness grounded in widely shared symbols of equivalence . but this sobering analytic conclusion should not , in our view , be interpreted as a counsel of despair .
few proponents of the justice model would want to recreate the hierarchical and authoritarian conditions which made retributive punishments such as the lex talionis meaningful to contemporaries , and religious affiliations and symbols of the sacred can not be organised in democratic societies by processes of deliberate institutional reform , even should they seem attractive .
the task , rather , is to consider what early modern societies can tell us about the links between the legitimation of punishment and broader social conditions ; to reflect on the theoretical and practical resources which resonate with modern moral and political discourse ; and to ponder how best they may be institutionalised under particular conditions .
both moral commonality and the sense of a real relationship between victim and offender as fellow members of a society have doubtless been attenuated by the increasing heterogeneity and moral pluralisation of social orders , especially in the more individualistic , competitive , liberal market countries . those countries in which the retributive revival appears to have had the most baleful effect in eroding the institutional counterpart to reconciliatory dispositions in the criminal process are those in which inequality , conflict and heterogeneity are highest .
conversely , scholarship on punishment in the nordic countries associates their penal moderation with their relative homogeneity , their relatively small size and hence sense of social interdependence , solidarity , and trust , their consensus - oriented political systems , and their relative levels of equality  all factors which foster conditions for the institutional counterpart of forgivingness and enhance expected associational value .
the lesson for the more punitive  and less equal  liberal market countries is that avoiding polarisation and reducing inequality is likely to be as important as the effort to reconstruct the criminal process to effectively foster repentance and reconciliation ; and that the key to penal moderation lies not only in reintegrative criminal justice policy , but in social policy and in political arrangements and institutional structures which maximise expected associational value among citizens . in conclusion
, it is important to clarify that our argument about the incapacity of the neoclassical revival to generate a robust sense of limits on punishment is not to be taken as suggesting that consequentialist theories of punishment are immune from analogous difficulties , let alone to make a case for penal consequentialism .
( in fact , one of us is inclined to take a restricted consequentialist line on punishment , but that argument is for another day . ) even leaving aside the well known distributive difficulties with purely consequentialist arguments for punishment , it will be evident that while many of the potentially positive consequences of punishment  deterrence , incapacitation , reform and so on  are in principle measurable with the increasingly sophisticated tools of the social sciences , the question of how much of any of them adequately balances the infliction of a particular penalty remains an intractable moral question which can not be reduced to any calculus , and one , moreover , on which views differ widely . in the realpolitik of penal practice
, the key aspiration must be to determine the ethically optimal penal practices consistent with political legitimation . for modern consequentialists , as for modern retributivists ,
there is little alternative to the messy business of building political and social coalitions around agreed conventions specifying , and limiting , adequate penalties .
hence our knowledge , from comparative research , that the countries which have most successfully resisted the drift to penal severity since the 1970s are those whose social , economic and political institutions have given them maximum capacity to coordinate policy , in the public interest , over the long term is of key ethical significance .
the value pluralism and heterogeneity of modern societies , sitting alongside our commitment to democratic politics , complicates the tasks of both legitimising punishment and institutionalising arrangements favourable to reconciliation within a stable set of symbols and practical arrangements .
the task has been yet further complicated by the spread of criminal law into ever greater areas of regulation .
the social task of legitimising and civilising punishment can not be separated from that of legitimising and civilising the deployment of criminal law , and while our focus in this paper has been on punishment , we accept that , parallel to the argument which we have made about the institutional conditions under which appeals to penal proportionality can be made meaningful , we need to come to some understanding of the conditions for building support around institutions capable of delivering social coordination on criteria of fittingness or proportionality relevant to criminalisation . but whether we are focusing on punishment or on criminalisation , we should train our attention on the analysis and conditions of existence of institutions stabilising and implementing substantive criteria of fittingness , rather than placing our reformist faith in the chimera of appeals to proportionality .","THE NEO-CLASSICAL REVIVAL AND ITS EFFECTS

"malignant tumors of thyroid follicular cell origin are categorized as well - differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( wdtc ) , consisting the majority of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( ptc ) and follicular thyroid carcinoma , poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( pdtc ) , and undifferentiated / anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( atc ) .
the 5-year , 10-year and 15-year survival rates are considerably lower in patients with pdtc ( 50% , 34% , and 0 , respectively ) than those in patients with wdtc ( 95% , 86% , and 81% , respectively ) .
it is important to recognize this entity . at present , ultrasound is the most important imaging method used for the preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules , which focuses on the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions .
as most thyroid carcinomas are ptcs , pdtc accounts for only about 1% of all thyroid cancers , and the malignant ultrasonographic features reported in the literature have mainly been based on ptc .
nonetheless , no study has reported on the diagnosis of suspicious pdtc based on integrating clinical and ultrasonographic features .
herein , we retrospectively analyzed our hospital database to study the differences between pdtc and ptc with the aim to provide more possibilities for recognizing pdtc earlier .
this study was approved by the ethics committee of peking union medical college hospital , and written informed consents were obtained from all patients to use their data in this study .
a total of 29 patients with primary pdtc were treated at peking union medical college hospital from november 2003 to december 2013 .
six cases with incomplete clinical data , 2 cases without surgical treatment , 3 cases with initial surgery at another hospital , and 3 cases with no ultrasound reports were excluded .
finally , 13 patients ( 10 women and 3 men ) with 16 nodules ( three patients had two nodules each ) were included in this study .
the age of all 13 patients of pdtc ranged from 30 to 77 years , with a mean age of 48.1  14.8 years .
five patients underwent fine needle biopsy ( fna ) , of whom 3 were suggested ptc , 1 was suggested finding carcinoma cells , and only one was suggested pdtc . in the database during the corresponding period , 39 gender- and age - matched cases pathologically diagnosed with ptc were randomly selected .
the age of the patients with ptc is ranged from 29 to 73 years , with a mean age of 47.0  12.6 years .
there were 30 women and 9 men with a total of 51 nodules ( 12 patients had two nodules each ) .
twenty ptc patients underwent fna , 14 were suggested ptc , 2 were found suspicious tumor cell , 3 were suggested follicular lesion , and 1 was suggested not finding enough cells to make a diagnosis .
age , gender , family history of carcinoma , complication with other thyroid lesions , single / multiple nodules , single / multi focal carcinoma , lymph node metastases , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , distant metastases , tumor , node , metastasis stage , and survival rate were recorded .
all patients underwent routine thyroid ultrasound examinations with gelogic7 , gelogic9 , or philipsiu22 before surgery with transducer frequencies of 815 mhz and 512 mhz .
in particular , standard ultrasound features were analyzed , including shape ( regular or irregular : regular shapes refer to all round and oval shapes while irregular shapes refer to all other shapes , such as large lobular , small lobular , and nodular ) , margin ( clear or unclear ) , anteroposterior to transverse diameter ratio ( < 1 or 1 ) , echogenicity ( isoechoic or hypoechoic ) , echotexture ( homogeneous or heterogeneous ) , cystic features ( solid - cystic or solid ) , calcification ( absence / other calcification or micro - calcification : micro - calcification refers to calcifications with a diameter 0.1 cm while absence / other calcification refers to other types of calcifications , such as curved calcifications , strip calcifications , and conglomerate calcifications ) , and the presence of capsular infiltration .
blood flow was divided into three types such as ( a ) no blood flow signal of any type within or around nodules , ( b ) blood flow signals around nodules , ( c ) rich and irregular blood flow signals within nodules . for statistical convenience ,
the first and the second types were grouped together as absence / not rich blood flow , and the latter was referred to as rich / irregular blood flow .
a student 's t - test was used for comparison of patient ages and the size of nodules .
fisher 's exact test was used for comparison of clinical and ultrasonic features and mortality rate .
this study was approved by the ethics committee of peking union medical college hospital , and written informed consents were obtained from all patients to use their data in this study .
a total of 29 patients with primary pdtc were treated at peking union medical college hospital from november 2003 to december 2013 .
six cases with incomplete clinical data , 2 cases without surgical treatment , 3 cases with initial surgery at another hospital , and 3 cases with no ultrasound reports were excluded .
finally , 13 patients ( 10 women and 3 men ) with 16 nodules ( three patients had two nodules each ) were included in this study .
the age of all 13 patients of pdtc ranged from 30 to 77 years , with a mean age of 48.1  14.8 years .
five patients underwent fine needle biopsy ( fna ) , of whom 3 were suggested ptc , 1 was suggested finding carcinoma cells , and only one was suggested pdtc . in the database during the corresponding period , 39 gender- and age - matched cases pathologically diagnosed with ptc were randomly selected .
the age of the patients with ptc is ranged from 29 to 73 years , with a mean age of 47.0  12.6 years .
there were 30 women and 9 men with a total of 51 nodules ( 12 patients had two nodules each ) .
twenty ptc patients underwent fna , 14 were suggested ptc , 2 were found suspicious tumor cell , 3 were suggested follicular lesion , and 1 was suggested not finding enough cells to make a diagnosis .
age , gender , family history of carcinoma , complication with other thyroid lesions , single / multiple nodules , single / multi focal carcinoma , lymph node metastases , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , distant metastases , tumor , node , metastasis stage , and survival rate were recorded .
all patients underwent routine thyroid ultrasound examinations with gelogic7 , gelogic9 , or philipsiu22 before surgery with transducer frequencies of 815 mhz and 512 mhz .
in particular , standard ultrasound features were analyzed , including shape ( regular or irregular : regular shapes refer to all round and oval shapes while irregular shapes refer to all other shapes , such as large lobular , small lobular , and nodular ) , margin ( clear or unclear ) , anteroposterior to transverse diameter ratio ( < 1 or 1 ) , echogenicity ( isoechoic or hypoechoic ) , echotexture ( homogeneous or heterogeneous ) , cystic features ( solid - cystic or solid ) , calcification ( absence / other calcification or micro - calcification : micro - calcification refers to calcifications with a diameter 0.1 cm while absence / other calcification refers to other types of calcifications , such as curved calcifications , strip calcifications , and conglomerate calcifications ) , and the presence of capsular infiltration .
blood flow was divided into three types such as ( a ) no blood flow signal of any type within or around nodules , ( b ) blood flow signals around nodules , ( c ) rich and irregular blood flow signals within nodules . for statistical convenience ,
the first and the second types were grouped together as absence / not rich blood flow , and the latter was referred to as rich / irregular blood flow .
a student 's t - test was used for comparison of patient ages and the size of nodules .
fisher 's exact test was used for comparison of clinical and ultrasonic features and mortality rate .
patients with pdtc had a significantly higher frequency of family history of carcinoma than those with ptc ( 30.8% vs. 2.6% , respectively ) and also had a higher proportion of multiple thyroid lesions including nodular goiter and hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( 61.6% vs. 23.1% , respectively ) .
nine cases of pdtc ( 69.2% ) had lymph node metastases , which was significantly higher than ptc ( 25.6% , p = 0.007 ) .

pdtc : poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma ; ptc : papillary thyroid carcinoma ; sd : standard deviation .
in 2004 , pdtc was officially listed as a distinct entity in the classification of thyroid carcinoma by the world health organization .
later , in 2006 , the pathologic diagnostic criteria for pdtc were further detailed at a conference held in turin . according to the consensus
reached that conference , pdtc is a malignant tumor that originates from thyroid follicular cells , and trabecular , island , and/or solid growth patterns are necessary for diagnosis .
tumor cells do not have the classic features of ptc nuclei and have at least one of the following characteristics : ( 1 ) a solid / trabecular / insular pattern of growth , ( 2 ) absence of conventional nuclear features of papillary carcinoma , and ( 3 ) presence of at least one of the following features : convoluted nuclei , mitotic activity ( 3  10 hpf ) , necrosis .
bejarano et al . reported a male : female ratio of 1:2.4 of pdtc , patient age from 6 to 69 years , and a peak incidence in patients older than 45 years .
regarding clinical symptoms , a significantly higher proportion of patients had a family history of carcinoma in the pdtc group ( 30.6% ; 1 case of thyroid carcinoma , 1 case of liver carcinoma , 1 case of lung carcinoma , and 1 case of brain tumor ) than those in the ptc group ( 2.6% ) .
family history of carcinoma is a major risk factor for thyroid carcinomas . in this study , the proportion of patients with a family history of carcinoma in pdtc group was higher than that of ptc group , suggesting that a family history of other tumors can also increase the risk of thyroid carcinoma .
however , due to the limited sample size in this study , this will require validation in a larger patient cohort .
the results of this study suggest that patients with nodular goiter or hashimoto thyroiditis have a higher risk of pdtc than ptc ; thus , close clinical observation and follow - up are recommended .
the proliferation of follicular cells in the nodular goiter may be associated with a greater possibility of atypical hyperplasia and vascular proliferation .
the reason may be that hashimoto thyroiditis increases the patient 's immune response , leading to hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells through stimulation of lymphocytes and results in the occurrence of atypical hyperplasia at the focus transitional zone .
owing to the low incidence but high malignant potential , pdtc is not well recognized and is often discovered incidentally during treatment when it has metastasized to lymph nodes or distant organs . as it is reported in the literature ,
pdtc is characterized by rapid , invasive growth , and higher mortality rate than ptc and is prone to lymphatic and other remote metastases .
accurate preoperative diagnosis , clinical staging , and risk assessment are very important to help make the treatment protocol and establish prognosis .
ultrasound is a valid method for diagnosis and follow - up of thyroid carcinoma . with the help of ultrasound - guided fna biopsy , thyroid carcinoma at an early stage
however , there are many reports of the misdiagnosis of pdtc ; fna may reveal a follicular tumor , follicular variant of ptc , adenomatous nodule , or ptc .
this may be related to the larger size , rapid invasive growth , limited amount of sample , and necrosis of the interested area of pdtc .
if we do not take positive and effective intervention for the above cases , we may miss the best time for treatment and improving the prognosis .
our study showed that pdtc and ptc have a variety of ultrasound features in common , such as irregular shape , taller - than - wide , hypoechoic , heterogeneous , solid mass , and micro - calcification , and these characters are the indicators of suspicious malignant tumor .
in addition , three following features suggest that the lesion may be pdtc : size larger than 3 cm , clear margin , and irregular / rich blood signals . in this study ,
92.3% of pdtc had clear margins ( 12/13 ) by ultrasonography , which was significantly higher than that of ptc ( p < 0.05 ) .
in general , a tumor having margin echoes with a smooth and complete appearance can be considered have an intact capsule .
most nodules without margin echoes or with an indistinct and irregular shape are noncapsulated malignant lesions .
as the foci of tumor cells in ptc is not clearly separated from the surrounding thyroid tissues , with common interstitial infiltration in the surrounding thyroid parenchyma , the margin is unclear , and the edge shows spiculated infiltration by ultrasonography .
however , the classical pathological feature of pdtc is an island structure , which is a distinct nest of tumor cells surrounded by a thin layer of fibrovascular stroma .
the area between tumor foci and the fibrovascular core often forms an artificial fracture lacking either typical papilla or a follicular structure .
about half of ptc showed sparse blood flow or no blood flow signal while 92.3% of pdtc displayed rich and prominent blood flow probably because of the higher malignant potential of pdtc , which is accompanied by stimulation of angiogenesis by tumor cells . in this
regard , most blood vessels consist of arteries with irregular distribution . in summary , pdtc is more aggressive , and its mortality rate is higher than ptc .
accordingly , more attention should be given to thyroid cancer nodules that show large size , regular shape , and rich blood flow signals on ultrasound to exclude the possibility of pdtc .","I

"neurofibromas are nonencapsulated , loosely textured dermal tumors composed of thin fascicles of cells with a spindle - shaped nucleus and scant cytoplasm .
blood vessels are increased in number in the stroma when compared to the normal skin , despite their white color in gross appearance . here
we describe 6 cases of solitary cutaneous neurofibroma where the number of blood vessels in the stroma is unusually higher than that of classic neurofibromas .
biopsy material obtained from 6 patients with solitary cutaneous neurofibromas diagnosed as  neurofibroma with a densely vascularized background was reviewed and the number of blood vessels within the lesions was compared with 5 cases of solitary cutaneous neurofibroma showing a classical vascularized stroma .
the biopsy material was fixed in formalin , embedded in paraffin , cut at 5 m and stained with hematoxylin - eosin , and immunohistochemistry was performed for s-100 , cd34 and d2 - 40 according to standard procedures .
we counted the number of blood vessels of each lesion per 10 high - power fields ( 40 ) on anti - cd34-stained sections .
on histological examination , the well - known pattern of neurofibromas with an intact epidermis overlying a relatively ill - defined dermal proliferation of s-100-positive spindle cells with undulated nuclei in a collagenous background was observed in all of the cases ( fig .
1 ) . no atypia , mitosis or infiltrating pattern was observed . in the majority of the vessels ,
the endothelial cells showed a positive reaction pattern for cd34 ( fig . 2c  d ) .
there were also some vessels which were positive for d2 - 40 , indicating their lymphatic origin ( data not shown ) .
the number of blood vessels was on average 50.7 (  15.4 ) per 10 high - power fields ( 40 ) in the cases of  neurofibroma with a densely vascularized background whereas the average number of blood vessels counted was only 23.4 (  7.2 ) in the classical neurofibromas ( p < 0.005 ; unpaired student t test ; table 1 ; fig .
neurofibromas are lesions characterized by delicate , in most cases only single cell - thick fascicles of cells with a spindled nucleus and scant cytoplasm , interpreted as schwann cells on electron microscopy , and usually positive for s-100 protein .
the overlying epidermis is intact and separated from the lesion by a so - called dermal grenz zone . in some cases , an infiltrative pattern into the subcutis
has been observed , and a vascularized stroma , sometimes abundant , has been documented . in our cases , we were able to describe an unusually high vascular density compared not only with normal skin , but also with classical neurofibromas . in a series of neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis-1 and sporadic neurofibromas , high vascular density associated with increased vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity
megahed   described 10 histopathological variants of neurofibroma : classic , cellular , myxoid , hyalinized , epithelioid , plexiform , diffuse , pigmented , granular cell , and pacinian .
subsequently , some other variants such as dendritic cell neurofibroma with pseudorosettes   and lipomatous neurofibroma   have been reported .
the histopathological pattern of the solitary cutaneous neurofibroma cases with a higher vascular density , which we describe here , is very particular .
we therefore propose this lesion to be a new histopathological variant of neurofibroma and name it angioneurofibroma .
the gross appearance of angioneurofibromas should be compared to that of classical neurofibromas for any macroscopic difference
. this feature might help to correctly interpret a highly vascularized lesion showing a histopathological pattern and immunohistochemical phenotype of neurofibroma , and to design new treatment strategies including angiogenesis inhibitors for these tumors .","Background

"for rural emergency systems , rescuing severe trauma cases that occur in remote locations 
 presents a complex challenge .
miyazaki prefecture is a rural prefecture located in southwest 
 japan , with an area of approximately 6700 km and a population of approximately 
 1,100,000 .
the faculty of medicine of the university of miyazaki hospital trauma and 
 critical care center ( hereinafter referred to as our center ) commenced its rapid 
 response - type doctor car services ( hereinafter referred to as doctor car ) in april 2014 . 

doctor cars have been introduced as alternatives in situations where a helicopter emergency 
 medical service ( hems ) can not be dispatched owing to poor visual flight conditions .
a doctor 
 car is presumed to be ineffective for emergencies occurring far from a base hospital because 
 of delayed medical intervention . in this report , we present a case of severe trauma that 
 occurred at a remote location , in which the patient s life was saved by close coordination 
 between the dispatched doctor car and a physician from a local medical facility .
a 31-year - old man was logging trees in the westernmost mountains of the prefecture in june 
 2014 when a tree collapsed and injured his left femur .
he sought first aid at the nearby 
 fire station , but because the trauma was suspected to be severe , the station requested a 
 hems from our center , which was approximately 56 km away .
however , the hems could not be 
 dispatched because of bad weather , and a doctor car was sent instead . soon after the doctor 
 car was dispatched to the scene ,
the same fire station also requested kobayashi municipal 
 hospital , which was the nearest hospital from the scene , to send a physician to the scene 
 ( figure 1figure 1a map of miyazaki prefecture , located in southwest japan . the scene of the accident 
 ( closed circle ) is in the mountains , remote from the university of miyazaki hospital 
 ( open circle ) which is the base hospital of the doctor car .
the general hospital 
 closest to the scene of the accident is kobayashi municipal hospital ( open box ) .
the 
 doctor car traveled on the highway shown in gray lines to reach the patient .
the 
 docking point ( closed box ) is almost halfway between kobayashi municipal hospital and 
 the scene of the accident . ) . a map of miyazaki prefecture , located in southwest japan .
the scene of the accident 
 ( closed circle ) is in the mountains , remote from the university of miyazaki hospital 
 ( open circle ) which is the base hospital of the doctor car .
the general hospital 
 closest to the scene of the accident is kobayashi municipal hospital ( open box ) .
the 
 doctor car traveled on the highway shown in gray lines to reach the patient .
the 
 docking point ( closed box ) is almost halfway between kobayashi municipal hospital and 
 the scene of the accident .
his radial artery had a weak pulse ; 
 his blood pressure was 84/48 mmhg , and his pulse rate was 120 beats / min .
there was 
 continuous hemorrhage from a contusion of approximately 15 cm on the medial side of his left 
 femur .
direct and indirect compression was applied to the injured and proximal areas , 
 respectively , to achieve hemostasis .
the physician from kobayashi municipal hospital arrived 
 at the accident scene 49 min after the accident and established a peripheral intravenous 
 line .
the doctor car from our center docked at the halfway point between the scene of the 
 accident and the municipal hospital at 1 h 6 min after the accident .
although pressure 
 hemostasis was achieved with gauze , the patient subsequently went into hemorrhagic shock .
he 
 was transported to our center for resuscitation via blood transfusion , as emergency blood 
 transfusion was not possible and complete hemostasis was not obtained at the municipal 
 hospital . because his state of shock was prolonged , tracheal intubation was performed en 
 route . during that time , the wound began hemorrhaging again , suggesting coagulopathy , and 
 pressure hemostasis using gauze continued to be applied .
photographs of the injury were 
 transmitted to our center , along with the patient s information , through the image 
 transmission system to prepare blood transfusions and summon the surgeons . upon arrival at our hospital ,
the patient s blood pressure was 62/33 mmhg , pulse rate was 
 153 beats / min , spo2 was 100% ( fio2 : 1.0 ) , and body temperature was 
 36.8c ; he was administered 3000 ml of extracellular fluids . his level of consciousness 
 under sedation ( midazolam 3 mg intravenously ) was glasgow coma scale 3 .
blood tests revealed 
 a hemoglobin level of 57 g / l , platelet count of 85  10/l , prothrombin 
 time - international normalized ratio of 1.45 , and fibrinogen level of 2.03 mol / l .
an 
 injury of approximately 2 cm in the left femoral vein was noted ( figure 2figure 2wound appearance .
the patient s left femur had a 15-cm laceration ; the femoral vein 
 also had a laceration of approximately 2 cm ( arrow ) .
the blood vessel was sutured , and the wound was cleaned and closed . by the 
 following morning , he had received a transfusion of 20 units each of packed red blood cells , 
 fresh frozen plasma , and platelet concentrate .
extubation was performed on day 2 after 
 admission , and artificial respiration was stopped . on day 22 , the patient was transferred to 
 another hospital for rehabilitation .
the patient s left femur had a 15-cm laceration ; the femoral vein 
 also had a laceration of approximately 2 cm ( arrow ) .

because vascular injury is rare and occurs in approximately 14.4% of external injuries , 
 approximately 30% of which are in the extremities , no treatment strategy has been recommended in the guidelines 
 of the eastern association for the surgery of trauma .
if injury occurs at a location that is distant from an 
 emergency medical facility , there is a risk of a sudden deterioration in a patient s 
 condition during transportation , as happened in this case .
treatment for hemorrhagic shock 
 includes resuscitation , blood transfusion , and hemostasis , and transporting the patient to a facility that can perform 
 early - stage definitive treatment is essential . in this case , we administered approximately 
 3000 ml of fluid to resuscitate him from his state of shock .
recent studies have shown that 
 restricting pre - hospital fluid infusion for hemorrhagic shock patients reduces blood 
 transfusion volumes .
however , 
 fluid restriction is not amenable during long - distance transport to proper facilities . 

therefore , carrying blood products such as packed red blood cells in doctor cars is prudent 
 for remote traumas .
miyazaki prefecture has employed a hems since 2012 . however , because helicopters are 
 restricted to visual flight in japan , our hospital initiated a doctor car system as an 
 alternative to the hems in 2014 . in the case presented herein , more than 2 h passed before 
 the patient reached the hospital . for an emergency occurring at a location that is distant 
 from the doctor car base hospital , early - stage medical intervention
is accomplished by 
 transporting the patient to a local medical facility before the arrival of the doctor car . 

had the examination and treatment commenced only in the doctor car , medical intervention 
 would have been delayed by a further 17 min , with possible detrimental consequences . 

consistent with the american college of surgeons guidelines on trauma , the japan prehospital trauma 
 evaluation and care program 
 also recommends transporting the patient to a higher - level facility while bypassing the 
 nearest emergency medical facility for the sake of a definitive diagnosis during the golden 
 hour ( within 1 h after injury ) .
as the prefecture s jurisdiction is large , trauma bypass alone 
 may not always save lives .
in fact , a systematic review conducted by hill et 
 al . revealed no 
 difference in the mortality rate of trauma patients transferred directly to the trauma 
 center compared with that of patients temporarily hospitalized in a non - trauma center before 
 transfer .
however , since a nearby emergency medical facility may not be able to adequately 
 treat patients with severe external wounds , it is critical to inform the higher - level 
 emergency medical facility of the patient s condition at an early stage .
a doctor car with 
 an emergency physician dispatched simultaneously while the patient is being transported to a 
 nearby emergency medical facility can serve this purpose .
however , a doctor car requires 
 time to arrive at locations that are remote from the base hospital .
therefore , it is 
 essential that fire stations recognize patients with serious illnesses and promptly request 
 a doctor car .
according to the guidelines published by american college of surgeons 
 committee on trauma in 2014 , 
 the undertriaging rate should be restricted to 5% of cases or less , whereas an overtriaging 
 rate of 2535% is permitted . however ,
when the accident occurs in a location that is remote 
 from the trauma center , a greater overtriaging rate for the doctor car ought to be 
 permitted . in our case ,
the doctor car and the ambulance arrived at the docking point almost 
 simultaneously . in a doctor car
, the dispatched physician usually coordinates the docking 
 point with the fire station and the dispatched emergency response team ; to reduce the 
 waiting time , it is important to choose a safe docking location that is accessible to both 
 vehicles . to achieve successful docking of the doctor car and ambulance car
, the dispatched 
 physician needs to skillfully handle communication tools such as a cell phone or radio . in 
 miyazaki prefecture , if the expected docking point was located in the area controlled by 
 another fire station , the fire station that controlled the expected docking area must 
 support the communication between doctor car and ambulance car by relaying the radio 
 transmissions .
to arrive at the destination facility as early as possible , the doctor should 
 minimize the time spent at the docking point , because medical intervention is not difficult 
 while traveling to the destination facility . in our case , 2 min elapsed between making 
 patient contact and leaving the docking point , and tracheal intubation was performed in the 
 ambulance en route .
owing to its speedy departure from the site , the ambulance was able to 
 reach the hospital earlier while communicating the patient s condition to the destination 
 facility for adequate preparation of blood transfusions and surgical personnel .
we 
 reemphasize that an early request for a doctor car , reducing the time to reach the docking 
 point , and sending all relevant information to the destination institute are essential for 
 taking full advantage of the abilities of doctor cars .
the patient s life was saved despite the accident occurring at a location distant from the 
 doctor car base hospital .
this case , in which an emergency physician was dispatched with the 
 doctor car , illustrates an additional use for doctor cars aside from their effectiveness in 
 early - stage medical intervention .","Introduction

"it ensures that the patient and the treating and/or palliative care team have a clear understanding of the goals and course of action .
as the patient and family require repeated reassurance , this communication has become synonymous with counseling . a term which aptly describes this interaction is  collaborative communication ' . in most cancer centers
the physicians undertake this communication / counseling themselves ; a few centers also have psychologists to provide additional counseling .
after informed consent , 25 consecutive parents of pediatric cancer patients in the age group 114 years were interviewed .
all the children were on treatment for their disease at our hospital for at least 6 months ( range 638 months ) , all children in the study group had acute lymphoblastic leukemia . they were administered a simple questionnaire which had been formulated according to world health organization ( who ) guidelines , parents were interviewed together , without the child being present .
are you interested to deliver all the information about the side effect of therapy to child ?
are you interested to deliver all the information about the side effect of therapy to child ?
two families did not complete the study ; as the child died and in other , the family opted for alternative medical treatment , both families refused to complete the interview and were excluded from the study , hence 23 interviews were completed and analyzed .
majority of the families had shown the negative response related to delivery of diagnostic information to child ( 65% , 15/23 ) , though it was encouraging to see at least 35% had been open to informing the child about their diagnosis figure 1 .
though almost all ( 96% , 22/23 ) felt the child should not make any decision about the treatment figure 2 . majority ( 61% , 14/23 ) felt the child should not even be informed about side effects of therapy , and especially about long - term effects figure 3 .
if the diagnosis , prognosis , and other information was to be told to the child , 100% preferred that the doctors to give the information to the child .
though they all approved of the amount and content of information given to the child , only 21% ( 5/23 ) were satisfied with the timing or manner it was delivered .
the parental reservations were that they had not been given sufficient prior knowledge of what was to be done ( counseling ) and would have liked additional time to prepare themselves and would have wanted the information to have been given to the child at a later date ( after treatment started and not before as done by physicians ) . family 's response related to delivery of diagnostic information to child family 's response related to child 's decision about the treatment family 's response related to delivery of information about the side effect of therapy to child palliative care was a difficult concept to explain and only three families were receiving palliative care at the time of administration of the questionnaire . in these families both child and parent were aware of the prognosis , but the parents felt that they would have liked to have shielded their child from the knowledge if possible .
deciding when to stop curative treatment , when such treatment was futile , was a hypothetical question that was posed to the families .
the parental responses showed that the decision was mostly the domain of the parents20 felt only parents should decide , seven doctors alone , four families stated that both the doctor and parent should decide , and none of the parents felt the child should take part in this decision - making process .
the study reinforces the already observed parental belief in the traditional paternalistic role of the physician .
these families were not under acute psychological stress ; but in some cases even with greater than 3 years of therapy , they were still finding it hard to communicate about cancer to their children .
parents of children with cancer are very unwilling to have the news broken to the child and tend to delay the process as much as possible .
they do not wish to involve the child in any deliberations for treatment or palliation .
indian parents want to shield and protect their children from the knowledge of cancer , as shown by their desire to delay the child 's counseling to after treatment starts and avoid unpleasant discussions on prognosis and side effects , this is an important cultural response , and the physicians need to be aware of it .
the treating team needs to forge an alliance with the family to facilitate communication and give the parents time to cope with their own fear and anxiety .
it did not take the individual parent ( mother / father ) views , but decisions are usually taken by the parents together in indian families and the dominant view is what realistically happens , hence we felt it gave the actual situation .
counseling needs are largely unmet and many more studies to provide communication guidelines are required .
better communication with the family to elicit how they would like to receive information will be a useful and important tool for physicians and counselors .

it is important for healthcare providers to give information in clear and local language and explain things according to the needs of the patient and if the patient is a minor , as per the parents preferences .
first information is to be given to the family , then gradual discussion of the disease and options with the patient , while providing hope , whenever the patient is ready for communication . in terminal cases
the training programs in communication skills should teach doctors and healthcare providers how to elicit patients preferences regarding communication of information . despite workshops being effective in changing key communication behaviors ,
it is not certain how much of what is learnt is applied to clinical practice as pointed out by maguire .","INTRODUCTION

"multidisciplinary approach is often necessary to treat complex dental problems in our patients and there can not be a better example than ortho perio interaction .
orthodontic treatment is based on the principle that if prolonged pressure is applied to a tooth , it will move as the surrounding bone remodels .
in essence , the tooth moves through the bone carrying its attachment apparatus with it , as the socket of the tooth migrates .
since this response is mediated by the periodontal ligament , tooth movement is primarily a periodontal ligament phenomenon . this being the situation , it is mandatory to see that good periodontal health prevails before , during , and after orthodontic treatment
. it could be an oral prophylactic procedure in adolescent patients or advanced periodontal treatment in adults so as to eliminate the presence of inflammation in the presence of which carrying out orthodontic treatment will have deleterious effect .
the orthodontic literature has presented different treatment modalities for the management of adult orthodontic patients with mild to moderate bone loss .
however , the management of adult orthodontic patients with severe bone loss continues to present a challenge .
all the experienced clinicians would agree that a well aligned dentition may be more conducive to periodontal health than a crowded dentition .
the most important factor in the initiation , progression , and recurrence of periodontal problems is the presence of microbial plaque .
inadequate maintenance of oral hygiene during orthodontic treatment increases the risk of developing gingival inflammation .
many adult patients seek orthodontic treatment for aesthetic improvement due to the mal - alignment of the anterior teeth secondary to periodontal breakdown .
but the aesthetics may not be the only concern for the clinician as malocclusion more often than not leads to trauma from occlusion , which would aggravate the deterioration of the dentition . in a follow - up study on 22 patients with up righted mandibular molars after an average of 3.5 years
, it was reported that pockets on the mesial surfaces were shallower on the up righted teeth than on the control teeth .
some case reports have reported that a reduction of probing depths in bony defects following tooth extrusion can also be achieved .
the combination of orthodontic intrusion and periodontal treatment has also been shown to improve periodontal conditions in animals provided oral hygiene is maintained and tissues are healthy .
intrusion of incisors in adult patients with marginal bone loss and deep overbite has been reported to cause root resorption varying from one to three mm .
it is suggested that intrusion is best performed with low forces ( 5 - 15 g / tooth ) to minimize root resorption .
studies have also shown that moving teeth into adjacent osseous defects , orthodontic extrusion with or without fiberotomy , and labial tipping of anterior teeth can be successfully accomplished without jeopardizing the periodontal support in the presence of adequate plaque control .
guided tissue regeneration ( gtr ) , demineralized freeze - dried bone allograft , or a combination of these are considered to be the most predictable regenerative procedures for achieving favorable treatment outcomes .
these findings were further supported by several researchers who established a large body of clinical evidence that clearly indicated periodontal bone grafts consistently led to better bone fill of the defect than the non grafted controls .
histological analyses of cementum regeneration in experimental animals have conclusively demonstrated that regenerative treatment with bone grafting leads to some degree of regenerated bone , cementum , and periodontal ligament .
general factors , such as the morphology of the defect , plaque control , and patient compliance can directly affect the predictability of periodontal regeneration . defect selection is critical to achieve a successful outcome .
deep and narrow defects show the most predictable positive response to regenerative procedures where as shallow defects show poor results .
in such a scenario , orthodontic intrusion can change a horizontal bone defect into a deep and narrow defect that is more favorable for regeneration of the periodontium through grafting procedures [ figure 1 ] .
( a ) severe bone loss , spacing and extrusion of incisors . horizontal defect ( h ) around maxillary left central incisor .
( b ) orthodontic intrusion changes the topography of the defect into a vertical ( v ) defect and narrow defect .
( c ) orthodontic intrusion in the presented case changing the topography of the original horizontal defect .
( d ) one wall defect in relation to right central incisor prior to periodontal regenerative surgery therefore , the field of orthodontics should consider the combined regenerative and periodontal surgical treatments an invaluable addition to the armamentarium available for the orthodontic treatment of adult patients with severe loss of periodontal tissues .
similarly , the field of periodontics should recognize the importance of orthodontic intervention in achieving results unattainable with periodontal treatment alone .
the most common symptoms include tipping and extrusion of one or more incisors and the development of spaces between the anterior teeth .
the management of such cases requires judicious interdisciplinary treatment planning by the periodontist and the orthodontist . in the present article ,
the critical role of the orthodontist in changing the topography of a bony defect to a more favorable shape is highlighted ( i.e. , a horizontal defect to a vertical , narrow , and deep defect ) followed by regenerative procedure by the periodontist to restore the vertical defects towards favorable clinical outcome .

they diagnosed her to be having chronic localized periodontitis compounded with trauma from occlusion . on clinical examination , grade iii mobility of maxillary anterior teeth
preoperative photographs and opg after inter departmental discussion on the treatment plan , it was decided to proceed with following steps in this case : 
 phase i therapy comprising of scaling and root planing before orthodontic treatment.alignment of the teeth with light forces using copper niti wires after extraction of 15 , 24 , 34 , and 44.continuous monitoring of periodontal health with periodic scaling and root planing and administration of gengigel ( 0.8% hyaluronic acid ) to improve the attachment was coordinated by the periodontist . 
 
alignment of the teeth with light forces using copper niti wires after extraction of 15 , 24 , 34 , and 44 .
continuous monitoring of periodontal health with periodic scaling and root planing and administration of gengigel ( 0.8% hyaluronic acid ) to improve the attachment was coordinated by the periodontist . after evaluation ,
regenerative periodontal therapy comprising of gtr and bone graft for the osseous defect . after the initial prophylactic treatment
for the next phase of retraction and space closure in the mandibular arch , we used 1925 ss wires and the same was achieved [ figure 3 ] .
mid treatment photographs and opg , retraction and space closure continuous periodontal follow - up comprising of scaling and root planing with interventional gengigel application in the anterior region was performed with favorable results [ figure 4 , table 1 ] .
effect of gengigel ( 0.8% hyaluronic acid gel ) effect of gengigel probing depth and cal the challenge was in the maxillary arch where we had to achieve retraction and intrusion .
we used 1725 niti arch wire with rcs design and light elastic chain to simultaneously intrude and retract the anterior teeth . at this juncture
, we decided to do intentional root canal treatment for maxillary anterior teeth to avoid any endo - perio cross infection [ figure 5 ] .
root canal therapy done with maxillary incisors as the desired movements were achieved , we shifted to 1925 stainless steel wire incorporated with curve of spee design .
this helped us to intrude and retract the anterior segment as well as to convert the horizontal bone defect to a vertical defect which can receive and retain graft material [ figure 6 ] .
post orthodontic treatment on achieving the short term orthodontic objectives such as alignment , good contacts , absence of rotations , class i occlusion with good cusp to fosse relation and good facial balance ; periodontal regenerative surgery was performed for 1221 .
gtr with bone graft [ duopackcollagen membrane and reinforced tri calcium phosphate bone graft ] in region of vertical defect 12 - 11 [ figure 7 ] .
( b ) bone graft and guided tissue regeneration wrt 11 - 12 [ duopack ] two weeks post surgically , we decided to remove the orthodontic appliance followed by lingual splinting [ figure 8 ] .
this depends on patient education and maintenance . periodic follow - up after periodontal surgery is essential .
orthodontic procedures in periodontally compromised patients require extensive periodontal care / consideration to maintain the periodontium in a healthy condition during and after treatment .
minor periodontal surgery may be required to prevent relapse after orthodontic treatment in addition to the lingual bonded retainers on a long term basis .
inter disciplinary approach complimented by patient education and continued care of good oral hygiene will transform patients with unattractive dentition due to migrated teeth secondary to periodontal breakdown and inflamed periodontium into individuals with attractive dentition and radiant smile . since there is a close relationship between orthodontic treatment and periodontal health and vice versa , an understanding of the ortho - perio relationship will help in bringing the best possible results in needy patients .","INTRODUCTION

"mucinous cystadenocarcinoma ( mca ) is a very rare breast tumor . to our knowledge ,
only 18 cases of mca have been published in the english literature , mostly focusing on the pathologic findings .
mca is a pathologically distinct disease entity ; however , radiologic findings have not yet been described in precise detail . here
, we report mammographic , ultrasound ( us ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings of primary breast mca in two patients , and review the literature focusing on imaging findings .
a 59-year - old woman presented with a mass in her left breast detected on screening mammography .
she was postmenopausal and did not have a family history of breast cancer or other malignancy according to her medical records .
physical examination revealed a 1.5 cm mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast , 5 cm from the nipple .
mammography showed a lobular - shaped circumscribed hyperdense mass , containing round or punctate microcalcifications ( figure 1a ) . on us ,
the mass was located at the far periphery of the left upper outer breast and appeared as a circumscribed complex cystic and solid mass .
the solid portion of the mass showed an irregular shape and isoechogenicity , with multiple echogenic dots corresponding to the microcalcifications seen on mammography ( figure 1b ) .
the solid portion showed low signal intensity ( si ) on t1 weighted imaging ( wi ) ( figure 1c ) and intermediate si on t2 wi ( figure 1d ) .
on dynamic contrast - enhanced images , the mass showed rim enhancement and nodular enhancement of the solid portion with persistent enhancement kinetics ( figure 1e ) .
the result of percutaneous core needle biopsy using a 14-gauge gun was intraductal carcinoma with mucin spillage .
the differential diagnosis based on the percutaneous biopsy result was mucocele - like lesions with ductal carcinoma in situ or mucinous carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ .
after partial mastectomy , a 2.0 cm mca with bloom - richardson grade i was diagnosed .
most nuclei were basally located and somewhat bland ; however , some nuclei showed more atypia ( figure 1f ) .
the tumor cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors but were positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ; 3 + ) .
she was premenopausal and had no family history of breast cancer or other malignancy according to her medical records .
the mass showed obscured margins and had a few faint microcalcifications ( figure 2a ) .
the solid portion of the mass showed hypoechogenicity and had a partially indistinct margin ( figure 2b ) . on doppler us , no increased vascularity or vascular stalk was noted ( figure 2c ) . on mri ,
the mass in the left mid outer breast was shown to be cystic and solid .
the solid portion showed an irregular shape and margin , had hypointensity on t1 wi ( figure 2d ) , intermediate si on t2 wi ( figure 2e ) , and heterogeneous enhancement with persistent enhancement kinetics ( figure 2f ) .
percutaneous core needle biopsy using a 14-gauge gun found cystically dilated atypical mucinous glands , and mca was suspected . after a left partial mastectomy ,
a 2.2 cm mca with bloom - richardson grade iii was diagnosed ( figure 2 g , h ) .
multiple variable sized cysts were filled with mucin . in this case , the mucinous epithelium showed marked atypia and pleomorphism .
the tumor cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and were also negative for her2 .

percutaneous core needle biopsy using a 14-gauge gun found cystically dilated atypical mucinous glands , and mca was suspected . after a left partial mastectomy ,
a 2.2 cm mca with bloom - richardson grade iii was diagnosed ( figure 2 g , h ) .
multiple variable sized cysts were filled with mucin . in this case , the mucinous epithelium showed marked atypia and pleomorphism .
the tumor cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and were also negative for her2 .
mca is characterized by cystic lesion containing mucin lined by columnar cells with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin or mucin - depleted columnar cells , while mucinous carcinoma is characterized by clusters of generally small and uniform cells floating in large amount of extracellular mucin .
previous reports have mostly focused on pathologic findings , with only a few reports briefly describing radiologic findings , providing few details .
mammographic findings of mca have been described in several case reports , and the most common finding was a well - defined multilobular mass with medium to high density .
our cases showed lobular shaped masses with relatively circumscribed margins and round to punctate internal microcalcifications . reported us findings of primary breast mca
are mostly circumscribed isoechoic to hypoechoic masses ; occasionally , irregular masses or cystic and solid masses have also been reported .
one case showed a circumscribed complex cystic mass with a small solid portion , whereas the other showed a more solid portion with an irregular shape and indistinct margins .
mri findings have not been described previously . in our cases , both tumors showed cystic and solid masses and the cystic portion of the masses showed a circumscribed margin and thin rim enhancement .
the intracystic solid portion of the tumor showed nodular enhancement and a large irregular solid mass with heterogeneous enhancement .
both showed persistent enhancement kinetics on dynamic enhancement images and intermediate si on t2 wi . in our cases , from the us findings of a complex cystic and solid mass , we considered the possibility of papillary neoplasm first .
however , a vascular stalk or increased vascularity , which is a characteristic finding of papillary neoplasm , was not detected . on mri
, our cases also showed a cystic portion with rim enhancement and an intracystic solid portion , which may suggest a papillary tumor .
however , the enhancement kinetics of our cases was persistent , while papillary neoplasms commonly show washout enhancement kinetics .
in the first case , the percutaneous biopsy result was intraductal carcinoma with mucin spillage , suggesting the possibility of mucinous carcinoma .
however , us showed a cystic mass with a small intracystic nodule with microcalcifications , which is not the typical finding for mucinous carcinoma , namely , an isoechoic solid mass with heterogeneous echotexture and a circumscribed or microlobulated margin .
mucinous carcinoma can also show cystic changes within the solid tumor because of the mucin pool , but our case showed a large cyst with a small nodule similar to intracystic papilloma rather than cystic changes within the solid tumor .
moreover , the microcalcifications on mammography were small and round rather than the coarse and heterogeneous microcalcifications commonly detected in mucinous carcinoma . on mri , the solid portion of the tumor showed an intermediate signal on t2 wi that was not as bright as that usually seen in the typical mucinous carcinoma .
mucocele - like lesions also show mucinous material in percutaneous biopsy samples , and they can have various shapes of calcifications on mammography .
however , they are usually benign cystic masses , including simple cysts , complicated cysts , and clustered microcysts , rather than complex cystic and solid masses , unless they are associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia or malignancy . in conclusion , mca shows a circumscribed mass with some lower suspicion microcalcifications on mammography , and shows an intracystic solid mass without increased vascularity or a vascular stalk on us . on mri ,
the solid portion shows intermediate si on t2 wi and heterogeneous enhancement , and the cystic portion shows rim enhancement .
when the above - described findings are detected during radiologic exams , and mucinous material is present in the biopsy specimen , mca can be considered as a differential diagnosis .","INTRODUCTION

"we searched the surgical pathology archives for cases diagnosed with de novo dlbcl in inha university hospital between january 2006 and december 2013 . among them , we included the patients who received six to eight cycles of standard r - chop chemotherapy .
having excluded the primary central nervous system lymphomas and cases diagnosed based on small biopsy specimens such as endoscopic biopsy or needle biopsy , a total of 48 patients with complete outcome data were eligible for the preparation of tma cohort , including 27 male and 21 female with a median age of 58.5 years ( range , 20 to 81 years ) .
two 1-mm duplicate cores from the diagnostic ffpet samples were represented on a tma by using a self - made tma and a home - made recipient block as described previously . using an automated immunohistochemical stainer ( bench - markxt , ventana , tucson , az , usa ) , sections of the tma cut in 4-m thickness were routinely processed for immunohistochemical stains for cd20 ( 1:500 , h1 , heat - induced antigen retrieval , bd pharmingen , san jose , ca , usa ) , bcl2 ( 1:100 , 124 , heat - induced antigen retrieval , dako , carpinteria , ca , usa ) , bcl6 ( 1:30 , pg - b6p , heat - induced antigen retrieval , dako ) , cd10 ( pre - diluted , sp67 , heat - induced antigen retrieval , ventana ) , and mum1 ( 1:100 , mum1p , heat - induced antigen retrieval , dako ) .
cases were designated as positive when 30% of the tumor cells were immuoreactive for all antibodies except for cd20 .
cases were classified into germinal center b - cell versus non - germinal center b - cell type according to hans classification .
the whole image of cd20-stained tma section was digitalized using a digital slide scanner ( vm600 , motic , ximen , china ) using a 20 objective ( fig .
1 ) . then , representative jpeg images were acquired from each tissue sample ( fig .
cd20 immunoreactivity within each jpeg image was semi - quantitatively assessed using imagej software ( http:/rsbweb.nih.gov / ij/ ) coupled with immunomembrane plug - in ( http://imtmicroscope.uta.fi/immunomembrane ) .
completeness ( 010 points ) and intensity ( 010 points ) of membrane staining was added for a score ( 020 points ) ( fig .
then , we used the average of the duplicates in analysis as the arbitrary level of cd20 for each case .
the primary outcomes of interest in this study were overall survival ( os ) and event - free survival ( efs ) .
os was defined as the time interval between the date of diagnosis and the date of death by any cause .
efs was estimated from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression , relapse , last contact , or death .
receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analysis was used to select a prognostically relevant cut - off score of cd20 expression that can dichotomize the patients in terms of clinical otucome .
kaplan - meier analysis was used to estimate cumulative survivals and the differences between survival curves were analyzed using log - rank test .
chi - square test or fisher exact test were used to compare the differences in frequency of categorical variables between two groups .
mann - whitney u test and kruskal - wallis test were used to assess mean differences between the groups .
multivariate regression analysis using the cox proportional hazards model was performed to determine the hazard ratios ( hrs ) of the clinicopathologic factors and cd20 levels .
all p - values presented were two - sided , and p < .05 was considered statistically significant .

the tma section immunostained for cd20 exhibited heterogeneous cd20 levels among patients , with a high degree of reproducibility in scores between duplicate tissue cores to duplicate runs ( fig .
3 ) . as indicated by a wide and linear range of the semi - quantitative scores with a negatively skewed distribution of data on the frequency histogram ( fig .
4 ) , the level of cd20 expression was significantly lower in patients who died of disease compared to those survived ( p=.012 ) ( fig .
the median follow - up period was 58.5 months ( range , 11 to 125 months ) .
overall , there were 27 male ( 56.3% ) and 21 female ( 43.7% ) patients , and the median age was 58.5 years ( range , 20 to 81 years ) .
after six to eight cycles of r - chop chemotherapy , cr was achieved in 41 patients ( 85.4% ) and 11 ( 11/41 , 26.8% ) of them experienced relapse .
the outcome - based roc curve analysis produced a predictive cut - off score of 11.75 in cd20 levels ( with an area under the roc curve of 0.751 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.571 to 0.930 ; sensitivity , 72.7% ; specificity , 70.3% ; p=.012 ) that could predict poor prognosis in terms of os ( fig .
, the overall patients in our cohort were dichotomized into the cd20-low ( n=20 , 41.7% ) and cd20-high ( n=28 , 58.3% ) .
table 1 shows the distribution of the clinical background characteristics of the patients in the two groups divided according to the cd20 expression level . there were no significant differences in clinicopathologic parameters between the two groups .
cr was achieved in 15 patients ( 75% ) in the cd20-low group and 26 patients ( 92.9% ) in the cd20-high group , with no significant difference in cr rate between these two groups ( p= .197 ) .
eventually , disease relapse was experienced by four out of 15 patients ( 26.7% ) in the cd20-low group and by seven out of 26 patients ( 26.9% ) in cd20-high group , with no significant difference in relapse rate between these two groups .
clinical events including disease progression were more frequently observed in cd20-low group ( 14/20 , 70% ) compared to cd20-high group ( 13/28 , 46.4% ) , with a significant difference in efs ( median , 37 months [ range , 4 to 100 month ] vs 96 months [ range , 6 to 100 months ] ) for the cd20-high group ( p=.032 ) ( fig .
the 5-year efs were 39.4% in cd20-low group and 66.5% in cd20-high group , respectively .
overall , nine patients died , including six deaths in the cd20-low group and three deaths in the cd20-high group .
median os was 50 months ( range , 11 to 100 months ) for the cd20-low group and 71 months ( range , 15 to 125 months ) for the cd20-high group , with a significantly shorter 5-year efs ( 39.4% vs 66.5% ) and os ( 59.9% vs 90.6% ) in cd20-low group ( fig .
following parameters were significantly associated with worse prognosis in terms of both efs and os : cd20 level lower than the cut - off score ( p=.039 and p=.035 ) and two or more sites of extranodal involvement ( p=.034 and p=.044 ) .
in addition , poor performance status with eastern cooperative oncology group ( ecog ) score 2 ( p=.042 ) and presence of b symptoms ( p=.023 ) were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in terms of efs , but not in terms of os .
the stage at diagnosis and international prognostic index score were not significantly associated with efs ( p=.423 and p=.099 ) and os ( p=.576 and p=.530 ) .
when all the parameters significant in univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis , lower cd20 level remained an independent prognostic factor for efs ( hr , 2.187 ; 95% ci , 1.015 to 4.745 ; p=.048 ) and for os ( hr , 4.291 ; 95% ci , 1.012 to 17.724 ; p= .043 ) ( table 2 ) .
two or more sites of extranodal involvement was an independent prognostic factor ( hr , 2.768 ; 95% ci , 1.028 to 7.571 ; p=.047 ) for efs but it was not of prognostic relevance with regard to os ( p=.098 ) .
ecog performance status ( ecog ps ) 2 ( p=.125 ) and presence of b symptoms ( p=.095 ) were not found to be in correlation with os in multivariate analysis .
the tma section immunostained for cd20 exhibited heterogeneous cd20 levels among patients , with a high degree of reproducibility in scores between duplicate tissue cores to duplicate runs ( fig .

the median follow - up period was 58.5 months ( range , 11 to 125 months ) .
overall , there were 27 male ( 56.3% ) and 21 female ( 43.7% ) patients , and the median age was 58.5 years ( range , 20 to 81 years ) .
after six to eight cycles of r - chop chemotherapy , cr was achieved in 41 patients ( 85.4% ) and 11 ( 11/41 , 26.8% ) of them experienced relapse .
the outcome - based roc curve analysis produced a predictive cut - off score of 11.75 in cd20 levels ( with an area under the roc curve of 0.751 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.571 to 0.930 ; sensitivity , 72.7% ; specificity , 70.3% ; p=.012 ) that could predict poor prognosis in terms of os ( fig .
, the overall patients in our cohort were dichotomized into the cd20-low ( n=20 , 41.7% ) and cd20-high ( n=28 , 58.3% ) .
table 1 shows the distribution of the clinical background characteristics of the patients in the two groups divided according to the cd20 expression level . there were no significant differences in clinicopathologic parameters between the two groups .
cr was achieved in 15 patients ( 75% ) in the cd20-low group and 26 patients ( 92.9% ) in the cd20-high group , with no significant difference in cr rate between these two groups ( p= .197 ) .

the prognostic significance of the traditional clinicopathologic parameters of dlbcl seems to be overshadowed by the introduction of r - chop as a standard regimen for dlbcl [ 8 - 10 ] .
bcl-2 expression assessed by immunohistochemical staining seems to be no longer associated with a poor outcome in dlbcl patients treated with r - chop . in addition , the prognostic value of immunophenotypic subtype determined by immunohistochemistry for cd10 , bcl-6 , and mum1 is questioned in rituximab era .
furthermore , the predictive significance of international prognostic index that has been the most important prognostic factor for dlbcl in pre - rituximab era also seems to be overridden by the addition of rituximab to chop regimen . when assessed semi - quantitatively using flow cytometry ( fcm ) analysis , the levels of cd20 expression in the fresh tissue sample were quite heterogeneous both among and within different types of non - hodgkin b - cell lymphomas .
in addition , the level of cd20 expression at the onset of disease seems to be an independent predictor for poor outcomes in patients treated with r - chop .
fcm analysis of fresh tissue sample , however , is not a routine practice in many institutions with limited resources .
accordingly , immunohistochemical assessment of cd20 expression in diagnostic tissue samples in forms of paraffin blocks should be a more feasible method both in terms of low cost and convenience in sample recruitment .
there has been no previous literature specific to the distribution of immunohistochemical levels of cd20 expression in the diagnostic ffpet samples of dlbcl and their association with the prognosis of the patients . in this study
, we used a free web - based image analysis tool that enabled us to acquire objective semi - quantitative scores of cd20 expression levels based on intensity and completeness of cd20-immunostaining of the ffpet sections . as indicated by the previous investigations using fcm analysis of fresh tissue samples , the levels of cd20 expression assessed by semi - quantitative immunohistochemistry were quite heterogeneous among the patients , with scores spread over a wide and linear range . by correlating the expression level of cd20 with the clinical outcomes
, we were able to identify a subgroup of dlbcl patients with cd20 expression levels below the cut - off score , who showed poor efs and os independent of other known clinical and pathologic parameters .
further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic role of the relative abundance of cd20 expression in a larger cohort .
interestingly , shimizu et al .   recently reported that histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitors augment cytotoxic effect of rituximab by increasing the level of cd20 in the cell lines of dlbcl .
accordingly , the patients with lower levels of cd20 expression who could be less amenable to rituximab therapy could probably benefit from pretreatment of hdac inhibitors such as valproic acid prior to the standard r - chop treatment .
alternatively , they could more likely benefit from the treatment with novel anti - cd20 monoclonal antibodies which show more anti - cancer activity in cd20 low - expression b - cell lymphomas .
for example , ofatumumab ( a fully human anti - cd20 monoclonal antibody ) and obinutuzumab ( a humanized type ii antibody targeted against cd20 ) have been shown to be active and safe in clinical trials that had included patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia which is known to have relatively lower levels of cd20 expression . in conclusion , a level of cd20 expression is heterogeneous in dlbcl and lower level of cd20 expression is a poor prognostic marker for survival in patients with dlbcl who are treated with r - chop chemotherapy .
semi - quantitative immunohistochemical estimation of cd20 expression can be used to identify a subgroup of dlbcl patients with poor outcome who might possibly benefit from the pretreatment with agents that can increase the level of cd20 expression in the cell membranes of the tumor cells .","MATERIALS AND METHODS

"it is necessary for taking a history , explaining the diagnosis , giving instructions regarding medicines or obtaining consent for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures .
empathy indicates one person 's appreciation , understanding and acceptance to someone else 's emotions .
have explored medical students understanding of empathy , emphasising its importance in modern patient - centered care .
lack of empathy is associated with suboptimal patient care behaviours and more recently as important clinical outcomes such as blood glucose and lipid control in diabetic patients .
smith and mishra stated that in any doctor - patient encounter , fact - finding and information gathering is the agenda of a doctor , whereas exploring hopes and fears rather than precisely giving information about symptoms is seen on the part of the patient .
communication should not be a mere exchange of words ; in anaesthesia teams , it should be directed towards co - ordinated and safe progress of the patient into anaesthesia .
communications by the anaesthetist can elicit subconscious patient responses in mood resulting in anxiolysis and analgesia .
for example , calling the sensation of a local anaesthetic injection  a numbing sensation rather than  a sting may result in quite different perceptions .
pain being an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage ; therefore a nocebo or negative suggestion will elicit a subconscious change that might be expected to adversely affect the post - operative experience .
senior faculty members were involved in training and teaching as follows : lectures were taken to create a background that patients are fearful about anaesthesia .
students were informed about their involvement in patient interaction and the need for effective communication .
students were explained the pathophysiology of pain and the need to adopt the practice of sympathetic listening to alleviate patients anxiety about anaesthesia and surgery . need for attitudinal change to impart the understanding about behavioural modification in future practice was taught .
students were informed about the questionnaires [ annexures 1 and 2 ] that they will be required to ask to the patients .
students were not aware as to which teacher is evaluating his / her performance at the time of giving spinal anaesthesia .
the teachers were blinded about the type of questionnaire that the student will receive post - operatively .
pre - operatively all students informed the patients about the proposed conduct of spinal anaesthesia in a sympathetic manner .
post - operatively they were randomly given the questionnaires to allocate them into group p or group c [ annexures 1 and 2 ] .
the interview questions in group p ( pain ) mainly focused the attention of patients on the surgical pain and those of group c ( comfort ) mainly diverted their attention from the pain .
the effect of students communication skill of alleviating patients anxiety about pain was to be tested .
students performed spinal anaesthesia under direct observation of procedural skills ( dops ) and their performance was assessed [ annexure 3 ] .
the extent of patient cooperation and skill of communication acquired was judged using smith and kendall behaviourally anchored scale ( skbs ) .
data was analyzed using chi - square test to find association between group p and group c with respect to questions-1 , 2 , pain on movement , pain at rest and botheration due to wound .
whitney test was used to find significant differences between groups p and c with median vas and median vnrs .
two independent sample t - test was used to find the significant difference between the study groups for mean dops and skbs scores .
communication skills and professional attitudes , as well as procedural skills , were taught to these students before they were subjected to this evaluation .
the responses to the questionnaires that were given to the students for a patient interview in the post - operative period were collected .
the checklists that the teachers were given to judge the students performance were also collected .
patients undergoing elective lower segment caesarean section ( lscs ) were included . those with complications like pregnancy induced hypertension , coagulation disorders , placenta previa , heart disease and multiple pregnancies were excluded .
totally 100 patients were studied with the indications for lscs being : previous lscs-24 , previous 2 lscs-11 , oligohydramnios-10 , post - dated pregnancy-7 , cephalo - pelvic disproportion-18 , intrauterine growth restriction-17 , failure of induction-5 and breech presentation-8 .
the questions that were asked to patients in each group were comparable as shown in table 1 .
comparison of number of patients responding to question 1 showed that , out of 50 patients in group p , 33 ( 66% ) did not complain of pain while 17 ( 34% ) had pain . in group c , 47 ( 94% )
patients felt that they were recovering and 3 ( 6% ) felt they were not .
for comparison of question 2 in group p 27 ( 54% ) said yes , 23 ( 46% ) said no ; and in group c 40 out of 50 patients ( 80% ) said yes , 10 ( 20% ) said no .
this shows that number of patients not having pain is more in c - group than in p - group .
comparison of questions in both groups comparison of questions with results in both groups median visual analogue scale ( vas ) in group p was 3 , and in group c it was 8 .
whitney test was used ; ( p < 0.01 ) significant difference in groups p and c was noted .
lower vas score in group p means lesser pain scores in the group and higher vas score in group c means more comfort .
comparison of number of patients responding to question 3 , when pain on movement was asked showed that in group p , 29 ( 58% ) had pain and 21 ( 42% ) had no pain . in group c , 24 ( 48% ) had pain , 26 ( 52% ) had no pain .
p = 0.423 indicates , more patients complained of pain in group p ; in group c , number of patients not having the pain was more but not statistically significantly higher .
comparison of number of patients responding to question 4 , when pain at rest was asked showed that in group p , 11 out of 50 patients ( 22% ) had pain and 39 ( 78% ) did not have pain
. in group c , 6 ( 12% ) had pain , 44 ( 88% ) did not have pain .
comparison of number of patients responding to question 5 showed that in group p , 20 ( 40% ) patients complained of wound pain and 30 ( 60% ) did not complain of pain . in group c , 14 out of 50 patients ( 28% ) complained of pain and 36 ( 72% ) did not complain of pain .
verbal numerical rating scale ( vnrs ) median in group p was 2.5 and that in group c it was 7 .
lower vnrs score in group p means lesser pain scores in the group and higher vnrs score in group c means more comfort .
student evaluation by teachers mean value of dops score obtained by 11 students in p - group was 3.98 ( standard deviation [ sd ] = 0.62 ) out of total 5 points and that obtained by 9 students in c - group was 4.13 ( sd = 0.56 ) .
this indicates no significant variation in procedural skills of students allocated randomly into two groups .
thus , students allocated to p - group have performed spinal anaesthesia equally effectively as those allocated to c - group .
mean value of skbs obtained by 11 students in p - group was 7.23 ( sd = 1.27 ) out of 10 points and that obtained by 9 students in c - group was 7.31 ( sd = 0.95 ) .
this indicates no significant variation in behavioural skills of students allocated randomly into two groups .
comparison of number of analgesic doses required in post - operative period in both groups showed that , in group p , 10 , 17 , 13 , 5 and 5 patients required 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 analgesic doses respectively , post - operatively and in group c , 13 , 13 , 19 , 5 and 0 patients required 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 analgesic doses respectively post - operatively .
frenk et al . state that professional health education has not kept pace with the advances in the health systems worldwide in 21 century . largely fragmented and static
curricula are likely to produce ill - equipped graduates if complete redesigning is not undertaken .
the core of the system is the encounter between people who need services and those who have been entrusted to deliver them .
the charter of medical professionalism states that , to focus on  primacy of patient welfare , doctor self - care is necessary for the doctors to meet the professional obligations expected of them .
empathy can be threatened by doctor 's distress , which is seen at all levels of medical training .
clinical teaching brings together the learning triad of patient , student and clinician / teacher in a particular clinical environment .
direct contact with patients is important for the development of clinical reasoning , communication skills , professional attitudes and empathy [ annexure diagram 1 ] .
it is generally observed that patients do not know about anaesthesia - related procedures and are anxious about surgery resulting in an overall excessively painful post - operative experience .
pain , modulate the neurobiology towards more excruciating post - operative pain . overall goal of our study was to teach the learning anaesthesiologists to communicate effectively with the patients .
the aim was to teach them to build a rapport with patients , so as to assure them a smooth intra and less painful post - operative course .
the teaching was expected to be effective enough to obtain a calm and cooperative patient for spinal anaesthesia on table .
the positive modulation of the neurobiology of patients was tested post - operatively by asking them both positively as well as negatively valenced questions .
the questionnaires were either oriented towards pain ( pain group ) or towards comfort ( comfort group ) .
the questions in both groups were serially comparable , and the responses obtained were statistically correlated [ tables 1 and 2 ] .
the professionalism and attitudinal skills of the students were tested by different teachers on different occasions .
mean value of dops score obtained by 11 students in p - group was found to be 3.98 ( 0.62 ) on a 5-point scale ; that of 9 students in c - group was 4.13 ( 0.56 ) .
p value of two independent sample t - test was 0.567 ( p > 0.05 = not significant ) .
this indicated that students allocated to p - group performed spinal anaesthesia equally effectively as those allocated to c - group .
thus , the professional skills were comparable in two groups . comparing the attitudinal and behavioural skills using skbs score , p - 0.867 ( p > 0.05 = not significant ) .
mean value of skbs score on a 10 point scale , of 11 students of p - group was 7.23 ( 1.27 ) and that of 9 students of c - group was 7.31 ( 0.95 ) .
this indicated that there was no significant difference between behavioural skills of students allocated to two groups [ table 3 ] . in a similar study ,
patients were interviewed using standard questionnaires by two midwives before evaluation by doctors , post - anaesthesia .
the midwives were aware about the group to which a patient was allocated , but the patients had no idea of any such intervention . written informed patient consent to take part in the study was obtained after the questioning was completed .
post - operative pain management was given to all patients as per usual protocol . according to authors , though different questionnaires were employed both ultimately focused patients attention towards pain .
they expressed a need of phrasing post - operative questions more accurately and improving internal validity in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment to minimise bias .
they reported that 75.7% of patients in pain group had pain and 79.4% patients in comfort group were comfortable . in our study ,
54% patients in group p had pain and 80% patients in group c were comfortable .
60% patients in group p had no botheration due to wound compared to 72% in group c. however , this number was not statistically significantly higher in group c compared to group p. thus , in our study 28% patients in group c and 40% patients in group p were bothered because of wound , whereas chooi et al .
thus , as a result of communication skill training given to students , they could improve the intra and post - operative patient satisfaction significantly .
the pre - operative visit helped to improve patients psychology to undergo anaesthesia procedures and surgery as has been judged by dops and skbs tool by teachers while assessing the students .
effective communication between doctor and patient has been stated the core of clinical requirement for the medical profession .
multi - disciplinary assessment of students clinical performance using amsterdam attitude and communication scale ( aacs ) has been made precise by de haes et al .
the goal of their study was to enhance students awareness about the relevance of learning behavioural skills in the earlier stages of their medical training .
four hundred and forty - two 5 year clinical students were judged 6 times in two settings by doctors and nurses and video - taped interviews judged by psychologists and doctors .
overall mean of the clinical performance was 3.96  0.55 ; judgments of behaviour in the clinic were more precise standard error ranging from 0.11 to 0.16 . in conclusion ,
the authors have recommended the use of aacs and the like instruments in other medical schools also for their summative assessments to be more feasible and useful .
comparison of the analgesic requirement in our study shows group c patients more comfortable than group p. dauphinee described the outcome of current education policies in health professions .
he referred to the need of a common framework to find out the impact of education programs at advance levels of training .
he suggested studying patient outcomes like improved survival , fewer complications and fewer side - effects from the hospital records and patient feedbacks about the quality of life reported after the treatment from patient records .
though post - operative questions were oriented towards either pain or comfort , number of patients without pain was found to be more in c - group than in p - group .
pain at rest and botheration due to wound was found to be comparable with less requirement of analgesics in c - group .
we , therefore , conclude that the pain mechanism was effectively modulated pre - operatively with the soothing pre - operative dialogue .","INTRODUCTION

"nurses use these skills to assess patients and the environment and to process and interpret patient information in order identify and fulfill patient needs ( 5 ) .
this process results in the establishment of nursing diagnoses , effective clinical decision - making , problem solving and the improvement of care quality ( 6 ) .
such a structured approach to patient care is an important characteristic of structured professional judgment ( 7 ) .
professionalization ( 8) in clinical judgment is a major challenge of modern nursing ( 7 ) and despite its critical importance , it is still poorly understood .
previous studies have explored and identified some of the main characteristics of nurses professional practice , clinical judgment , and clinical decision - making .
these characteristics included using knowledge and conceptual models in practice ( 9 , 10 ) , adopting an interdisciplinary collaborative decision - making approach ( 9 ) , including clinical judgment in nursing educational programs ( 11 , 12 ) , and using evidence , intuition and autonomy ( 13 ) .
( 11 ) noted that nurses skillfulness is one of the main characteristics of professional nursing practice .
nurses skillfulness pertains to their ability to use their skills in different situations . in other words ,
nurses ability to use knowledge , experience and evidence , as well as their critical thinking skills in daily practice reflects their skillfulness in clinical judgment .
professional autonomy is nurses ability to establish relationships and interact with others and to use knowledge and wisdom in daily clinical practice ( 14 ) .
gillet et al . ( 15 ) conducted a survey study on 500 french nurses and reported that procedural justice and supervisors autonomy support , positively affects nurses satisfaction and perceived organizational support . implementing educational programs for improving nurses clinical judgment is another characteristic of professional nursing practice .
kantar and alexander ( 16 ) integrated clinical judgment into nursing curriculum and reported that education enhances nurses clinical judgment skills ( 17 ) .
other educational interventions such as conceptualizing ( 18 ) and simulation ( 19 ) as well as teaching critical thinking skills ( 20 ) can also improve nurses clinical judgment ability .
21 ) reported that nurses collaboration with other healthcare providers plays an important role in their professionalization .
moreover , interdisciplinary collaboration between clinical nurses and nurse educators can improve nurses clinical judgment skills ( 17 , 22 ) . despite the importance of clinical judgment in nursing
, our critical appraisal of the literature revealed that previous studies have examined only specific aspects of the concept or compared certain types of this concept , mainly by using quantitative approaches in nursing .
for example , elliott ( 23 ) conducted a grounded theory study to explore the issues of nurse - patient interaction in clinical judgment .
the aim of this study was to explore the process of iranian nurses development in clinical judgment .
in this qualitative study we used a grounded theory approach , which is the best method for exploring complex social processes and individuals main and common concerns ( 23 ) .
moreover , clinical judgment is an interactive process and such processes are the core component of the symbolic interaction theory ( 23 ) .
the main interview questions included but were not limited to the following ; would you please explain about your patient assessment practice during a workday ?
moreover , we complemented the study data by attending the clinical settings and observing nurses clinical judgment practice .
the researcher who was the interviewer was familiar with the method of the study and he interviewed the participants face - to - face .
the findings of each interview and the recorded observations guided the subsequent interview or observation .
we continued the data collection until data saturation , i.e. until development of all the emerged concepts and categories and discovery of the relationships between them .
we scheduled the interviews according to the participants preferences and convenience . to clarify ambiguities in the conducted interviews
nurses with at least three years of work experience in clinical nursing who were willing to participate in the study and share their experiences were considered as key informants .
thereafter , we employed the theoretical sampling method to develop the emerging concepts and categories .
we employed maximum variation sampling method to select different participants ( table 1 ) working in different clinical settings of kurdistan university of medical sciences located in the sanandaj city of iran .  
inclusion criteria included willingness to participate in the study and having full experience in clinical judgment .
one nurse who was the mother of a seriously ill child refused to participate , which ended in her exclusion from the study .
in general , 24 participants took part in the study ( table 2 ) .   having sufficient experience of hospitalization .
the ethics committee of tarbiat modares university , tehran , iran , approved the study ( no : 52/112071 ) .
constant comparative analysis of old and new data and use of analytic tools helped us minimize the effects of biases on the analysis process .
the employed analytic tools included questioning , constant comparisons , using the flip - flop technique , thinking about different meanings of words , drawing upon personal experiences , waving the red flag , and looking at language .
we managed the study data using the maxqda 10.0 software . to establish the credibility of the study findings , we performed data analysis concurrently with data collection and employed the constant comparison analysis , active listening , prolonged engagement and immersion techniques , as well as member - checking .
moreover , we documented and kept a record regarding all of our analytic activities for the purpose of dependability . to ensure dependability we employed the triangulation technique . in triangulation
, we collected the study data by using both the interview and the observation methods . to ensure the confirmability of the study findings
finally , we recruited a maximum variation sample to improve the transferability of the study findings .

the study participants main concern was  being non - professional in clinical judgment development . in response to this concern , they were  struggling for becoming professional. this was the study s core category encompassing and linking all the other categories .
when nurses were supported professionally , they were able to develop their professional clinical judgment .
however , in case of growing presence of non professional factors , they were unable to openly practice their clinical judgment skills ( figure 1 ) .
the properties or sub - categories of the study core category were  striving for gaining professional autonomy ,  striving for integrating clinical judgment skills ,  scrambling to make effective educational interventions , and  striving for professional and inter professional collaboration ( table 3 ) .
our participating nurses were willing to make independent nursing interventions , practice an independent profession , and create a distinctive professional identity .
one of their strategies was to develop a specialized curriculum both for the theoretical and clinical nursing education .
they believed that such a curriculum could help them make independent clinical judgments and hence , gain autonomy .
a nurse said ,  after completing specialized trainings in intensive care , i acquired better clinical judgment skills and now i can make more accurate clinical judgments  .
nurses also noted that gaining more autonomy from medicine , in terms of nursing interventions , would help them make independent clinical judgments .
accordingly , they had adopted strategies such as providing patient care based on nursing models and theories as well as clinical practice guidelines to enhance their autonomy .
a practicing nurse said ,  providing care to patients based on orem s model helped us make autonomy independently from physicians  .
we , based on clinical practice guidelines , could judge whether the patient needed suprapubic bladder massage or any other intervention  .
nurses proficiency in using their own clinical knowledge , experience , and critical thinking skills as well as clinical evidence also helped them make independent clinical judgments .
our participants were also striving for creating a culture for independent presence of nurses in clinical judgment . in an attending physician
s words ,  in my tv talks , i tried to present nurses autonomy in clinical judgment  .
the participating nurses strived to use different clinical judgment skills based on patients condition and the immediate situation .
for example , in emergency situations , if there was a lack of clinical guidelines , experienced nurses integrated their knowledge and experience for making accurate clinical judgments .
a practicing nurse said ,  immediately after delivery , the mother developed pulmonary emboli .
as we had foreseen this problem based on our previous experiences , we immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and she revived  . in emergency situations , inexperienced nurses had no option but to rely on physicians knowledge and experience to make clinical judgment .
a practicing nurse affirmed this reliance on physicians when she said ,  at the emergency department , we had no guideline for making clinical judgment about patients needing computerized tomography ( ct ) scan .
consequently , we were compelled to make judgment based on the attending physician s experience  . in emergency situations , if nurses had access to guidelines , they made clinical judgments by integrating guidelines and their own knowledge and experience .
a practicing nurse said ,  based on cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) guidelines , our judgment was that the patient needed cardio version .
our previous experience also confirmed this  . in normal conditions , however , nurses approach to integrating their clinical judgment skills was different from emergency situations . in such conditions , nurses integrated their own knowledge and experience , clinical guidelines , and recent research findings for making judgment .
care , a nurse said ,  for applying dressing on a bed sore , i referred to the findings of a research paper .
our participating nurse educators were scrambling to integrate clinical judgment into nursing curriculum and clinical education .
i am trying to teach this concept to my students during both theoretical and clinical educational courses  .
nurse managers and practicing nurses , on the other hand , were also scrambling to include the concept of clinical judgment in continuing education , patient education , and self - learning programs .
a head nurse added ,  we are scrambling to develop and offer courses for improving nurses clinical judgment skills  .
another strategy adopted by our participants was to integrate nursing and medical education in terms of clinical judgment .
another nurse educator said ,  to improve nurses clinical judgment skills , i tried to schedule and hold joint conferences among practicing nurses , nursing students , and attending physicians  .
our participating nurses , nursing students , nurse educators , physicians , and patients and their family members were striving for interpersonal and interdisciplinary collaboration in clinical judgment activities .
a practicing nurse said ,  when doing patient assessment , the attending physician paid attention to my nursing report and the patient s history that i had recorded .
nurses participation in activities greatly depended on their self - confidence and clinical judgment ability .
a practicing nurse mentioned ,  when interacting with the attending physician , i tried to use reasoning and to refer to clinical evidence for sharing my opinion  .
another said ,  some of our nurses also strive to involve patients and their family members in clinical judgment  .
another practicing nurse said ,  at the psychiatric ward , we record the patient history by questioning both the patients and their family members
depending on their awareness of patient s condition , patients and their family members were sometimes willing to participate in the clinical judgment process .
my father has allergy to salbutamol. she informed the doctor and the doctor prescribed an alternative medication  .  
a shift supervisor said ,  to improve nurses clinical judgment skills , we held joint morning report sessions .
we tried to involve physicians , nurse educators , and nursing students in these sessions  .

in this study , we aimed to explore the process of iranian nurses professionalization in clinical judgment .
the study findings revealed that the participants employed different strategies for becoming professional in clinical judgment development .
these strategies constituted the core category of the study , which was  struggling for becoming professional in clinical judgment. to the best of our knowledge , none of the previous studies had explored the process of professionalization in clinical judgment .
however , several studies have reported some of the properties and strategies of professionalization in clinical judgment ( 12 , 24 ) .  
we found that one of the strategies employed by our participants for becoming professional in clinical judgment was striving for gaining professional autonomy .
the participating nurses were striving for specialization in nursing and for making independent nursing interventions .
( 25 ) reported a significant correlation between residents skillfulness and their ability to make accurate clinical judgments .
our participating nurses tried to provide patient care based on nursing models and theories and clinical practice guidelines .
gampel ( 26 ) reported that independent interventions can result in accurate clinical judgment only when they are designed and implemented based on professional standards .
the study findings also revealed that nurses used clinical evidence as well as their own clinical knowledge , experience , and critical thinking skills to gain autonomy in clinical judgments .
( 24 ) noted that evidence - based practice and experience - based intuition improve nurses autonomy in clinical judgment .
they also found that nurses struggled with organizational authorities for maintaining their professional autonomy ( 24 ) .
our participants were also striving for developing a culture for improving nurses autonomy in clinical judgment .
wang et al . ( 27 ) found that socio - cultural factors interfered with nurses professional autonomy in clinical judgment .
we found that another strategy used by nurses for becoming professional was the integration of different clinical judgment skills in different situations . in case of limited access to clinical guidelines ,
more experienced nurses were able to use their intuition and critical thinking skills to make accurate clinical judgments and handle the situation .
dickson ( 28 ) described how the nurses integrated different knowledge and skills to make decisions in the medication administration process .
clarke ( 29 ) found that surgical residents who were able to use their clinical skills according to patient s conditions made clinical judgments that were more accurate .
( 30 ) also found that nurses with higher ability in integrating different skills were more able to recognize and manage uncertainties in their practice . in a study aimed at evaluating implicit clinical judgment , nakash and alegria ( 31 ) found that clinical judgment based on experience and knowledge could lead to the integration of information .
our participating nurses were also scrambling to make effective educational interventions ( such as including the concept of clinical judgment in the nursing curriculum as well as continuing education , patient education , and self - learning programs ) to develop their clinical judgment ability .
lasater ( 32 ) noted that the patterns of clinical judgment need to be integrated in students professional conduct . in previous studies ,
different educational interventions including clinical simulation ( 33 ) , concept mapping ( 11 ) , and continuing education programs ( 34 ) were developed and implemented for promoting clinical judgment .
nielsen ( 35 ) reported that concept - based learning activities designed based on the tanner clinical judgment model enhanced students clinical judgment skills and helped them move form novice to experts .
lasater ( 32 ) reported that to maximize the effectiveness of simulation in developing students clinical judgment skills , simulation - based educational programs need to be integrated into clinical education and practice .
lasater and nielsen ( 36 ) , banning ( 37 ) also noted that incorporating experienced nurses and nurse educators into clinical judgment educational interventions helps expand students understanding of clinical judgment . striving for professional and inter professional collaboration was another strategy adopted by our participants for clinical judgment development .
the collaboration was among all parties involved in patient care including physicians , nurses , patients , and their family members .
( 38 ) noted that collaboration between nurses and other staff could lead to avoid errors . according to legare et al .
( 9 ) , interdisciplinary collaboration and interpersonal interaction in the process of clinical decision - making and clinical judgment are the key attributes of nurses professionalism .
interdisciplinary collaboration among nurses , specialists , nurse educators , and nursing students is an absolute prerequisite for developing critical thinking and clinical judgment skills ( 39 , 40 ) .
elliot ( 23 ) also noted that for making accurate clinical judgments , nurses need to closely collaborate with patients and their families .
collaboration between nurses and patients and their families result in higher level of satisfaction ( 41 ) .
finally , the study findings revealed that participants employed different strategies for clinical judgment development .
these strategies constituted the core category of the study , which was  struggling for becoming professional .
to the best of our knowledge , none of the previous studies explored the process of professionalization in clinical judgment .
however , several studies have reported on some of the properties and strategies of professionalization in clinical judgment ( 12 , 13 ) .
further studies are needed to fully understand the process of professionalization in clinical judgment development .
investigating the effectiveness of integrating clinical judgment into nursing curriculum and continuing education programs is also recommended .
we strived to manage our experiences and viewpoints by  drawing on personal experiences ; however , these may affect our approach towards data collection methods and appropriate analysis .
on the other hand , the sincere cooperation of the participants was a strong point of this study .","1. Background

"a 31-year - old male patient ( height 173 cm , weight 70 kg ) with no medical history of particular significance had been receiving treatment at a dermatology clinic for ten years for erythematous patches accompanied by non - painful itching in both nasal alar creases , both perioral areas , and both posterior auricular folds ( fig .
1 ) . a topical steroid treatment was chosen , as he had tested negative on the koh test .
it was notable that even on the steroid treatment , skin lesions appeared when he consumed alcohol or was dehydrated .
the patient was on the topical steroid treatment when he visited our hospital , and erythematous patches were visible in the nasal alar creases and perioral areas . as a previous study had reported a case of acne vulgaris treatment with sgb , and the mechanisms of acne vulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis
the patient was positioned with the anterior spine extended , so that the transverse process of the c6 vertebra ( chassaignac 's tubercle ) could be easily detected .
a needle was vertically inserted at the anterior tubercle and was placed on the transverse process .
five ml of 1% mepivacaine were injected after fixing the needle in position and confirming that there were no abnormal sensations in the upper limb or blood aspiration .
after administration of the injection on one side , ipsilateral ptosis and nasal obstruction occurred but faded about two hours later .
the skin lesions disappeared within three days , after which the patient wished to stop the treatment for personal reasons .
however , the patient revisited the hospital two months later due to a relapse . during the follow - up , the patient noted that there had been no symptoms up to one week before the revisit .
we initiated the same treatment procedure and the patient 's skin lesions disappeared after five trials ( fig .
fifty more trials were performed , and the patient has not seen a relapse of the symptoms or side effects since .
although the fundamental cause of seborrheic dermatitis has not yet been identified , increased sebaceous gland secretions , the proliferation of malassezia spp , m. globose , and m. restricta and subsequent inflammation increase , as well as changes in the host immune function , are presumed to be some of the major causes .
m. globosa and m. restricta break down the lipids in the sebum to form free fatty acids and triglycerides .
the resulting unsaturated fatty acids can penetrate the skin and induce inflammation . moreover , increased amounts of natural killer cells ( nk1 + ) , cd16 + cells , and inflammatory interleukins , as well as the proliferation of complements  which come as a result of changes in the host immune function  are clearly visible in the skin lesions .
in general , multiple topical therapies ( antifungal shampoo , corticosteroid cream , antifungal cream ) are used as a treatment to eliminate the cause and to improve the symptoms .
stellate ganglion is also called cervicothoracic sympathetic ganglion ; it is located on the first anterior rib or the anterior tubercle of the c7 transverse process .
the sympathetic fibers of the lower face , cervical , and upper limbs cross the stellate ganglion ; therefore , these fibers can be blocked with sgb .
sgb is used in the differential diagnosis and treatment of autonomous nervous system disorders of the head , neck , and upper limbs .
sgb increases the blood flow rate without altering the blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output , and stabilizes hypertonic conditions of the sympathetic nerves , thereby blocking the pain associated with visceral afferents .
a skin biopsy performed on a seborrheic dermatitis patient 's lesion revealed increased counts of inflammatory mediators ( interleukin-1 , [ il-1 ] , il-2 , il-4 , il-6 , il-10 , il-12 , gamma interferon , tnf - a ) .
liu et al .   conducted a study on severe trauma patients and reported that the concentrations of il - b , il-6 , and tnf - a decreased 24 to 72 hours after a sgb .
park et al .   successfully treated an acne vulgaris patient with over 50 trials of sgb , and wajima et al .  
these results indicate that sgb is effective in reducing hyper inflammations caused by seborrheic dermatitis , and thus in mitigating the related symptoms . according to a previous study by wakusugi
, sgb improves the blood flow in the brain and influences hormone secretions , effectively improving the symptoms of diseases responsive to steroids ; hence , sgb can also be applied to seborrheic dermatitis .
furthermore , sgb affects the neural and immune systems . the sympathetic nervous system , which stems from the nucleus ceruleus of the brainstem , plays an important role in the neural and immune systems . the post - ganglionic sympathetic nerves , which travel along the paravertebral ganglia and prevertebral ganglia , release norepinephrine into various tissues .
the concentrations of brain norepinephrine and serum cortisol are proportionately raised to maintain the reflex circuit of the hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal and sympathetic nerve systems . under physiological conditions
, the immune organs are innervated by the sympathetic nerves , and adrenergic receptors are expressed on the surface of most granulocytes .
sgbs regulate the neuroendocrine - immune network and restore homeostasis within the body by blocking the sympathetic nervous system .
this in turn is presumed to contribute to the restoration of unbalanced statuses , such as seborrheic dermatitis . from a different perspective ,
uchida et al .   suggested that a chronic increase in sympathetic tone undermines the pinealocyte functions .
subsequently , the plasma melatonin level is reduced , resulting in sleep deprivation , which in turn causes an increase in sympathetic tone .
sgbs block this sympathetic cycle and restore a normal melatonin rhythm , ultimately helping patients to maintain a normal sympathetic tone .
this restoration of a normal rhythm also contributes to the effective regulation of the neuroendocrine - immune network . in conclusion ,
seborrheic dermatitis patients are treated with antifungals and steroids . in cases in which the patients are unresponsive to these traditional treatment modalities

"the incidence of colorectal cancer ( crc ) in korea has been markedly increasing in recent years .
this epidemiologic change in korea requires an increasing number of colonoscopies , which are highly effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of crc.1,2,3 colonoscopy is currently regarded as the gold standard and preferred screening method for crc .
however , evidence suggests that colonoscopy is not as sensitive for the detection of neoplasia as previously believed , as demonstrated in studies analyzing the effectiveness of tandem colonoscopy and ct colonography.4,5 a systemic review of six studies on tandem colonoscopy showed that the pooled miss rate for polyps of any size was 22%.4 using ct colonography as a reference standard , the miss rate of conventional colonoscopy for a large adenoma ( 10 mm ) was 12%.5 as a result , a significant number of colorectal neoplasias , including cancers , may be missed , even by experienced endoscopists .
moreover , results from the national polyp study and several other studies6,7,8 suggested that colonoscopy is associated with only a 37 - 65% reduction in mortality from crc , which is much lower than that reported previously . this could be attributed to the limited effectiveness of colonoscopic prevention of crc , especially in the right - sided colon . therefore , the role and limitations of colonoscopic screening must be carefully reconsidered .
the problem of the so - called interval cancers or missed cancers has been highlighted recently.9,10,11,12 crcs detected in patients who have received colonoscopies within the surveillance interval are called interval cancers , and if they arise from missed lesions , they are also called missed cancers.13 this raises a question regarding the precise prevalence of interval cancer .
early studies have shown that 4 - 5% of crcs may be missed on a single colonoscopic examination .
9,10 however , recent studies reported an increase in the prevalence of interval cancers of up to 8%.11,12 
 table 1 summarizes the major findings of studies conducted since 2006 reflecting the prevalence of interval cancers.8,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 based on 57,839 patients from the surveillance , epidemiology , and end results - medicare database , 7.2% of patients developed interval cancers.11 in a manitoba cancer registry database , approximately 7.9% ( approximately 1 in 13 ) of 4,833 crcs were classified as missed cancers.12 in korea , the prevalence of interval cancer was reported to be 6.2% by kim et al.24 ; however , this study was limited by referral bias , selection bias , and recall bias , as it was based on data obtained by telephone calls from a single tertiary referral center
. therefore , well - designed population studies are necessary to determine the prevalence of interval cancer in korea . in a population - based study from a danish group,25 interval cancer ( colonoscopies performed 1 - 5 years before diagnosis ) was 2.6% among 38,064 crc cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 . in a population - based study conducted in utah,26
6% of all patients with crc had interval cancers ( colonoscopies performed 6 - 60 months before diagnosis ) among 2,659 crcs diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 .
most previous studies on interval cancers may be limited , as they relied on registry or administrative data , which frequently lack detail and might be less appropriate for the identification of underlying causes .
previous studies were also limited by the fact that definitions of interval cancer were restricted to the initial 3 - 5 years after colonoscopy and did not specifically focus on a complete negative colonoscopy ( i.e. , a colonoscopy with no detection of adenoma ) . to overcome these limitations ,
a population - based study was performed in germany using the definition of interval cancer as a crc occurring within 10 years after a complete negative colonoscopy.21 using this 10-year definition , 4.0% of interval cancers were identified among 1,945 crc cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 . to interpret the large variation in the prevalence of interval cancer , several factors
should be considered : differences in the study design ( retrospective vs. prospective ) , the different definitions of interval cancers ( 3 - 5 years vs. 10 years ) , the use of data ( claims - based administrative vs. clinical data ) , differences in the study population ( screening vs. diagnostic indications ) , and differences in endoscopist specialty.27 however , most studies have shown that colonoscopy offers suboptimal protection against crc , especially in the right colon .
we could estimate the magnitude of this risk in our routine practice in korea . assuming that proximately 20,588 new cases of crc were diagnosed ( data in 2007 ) based on the korea national cancer incidence database28,29 and considering an average risk scenario ( e.g. , 4 - 8% of diagnosed crcs are interval cancers ) , approximately 823 - 1,647 interval cancers might be expected to occur annually in korea .
considering the increasing age of the general population and the number of colonoscopies performed in korea , the incidence of interval cancer is expected to increase .
regardless of the magnitude of this problem , the medical and social impact of the failure of colonoscopy to prevent crcs may be devastating.27 therefore , prompt elucidation of the factors implicated in interval cancers is necessary .
although the exact etiology of interval cancer is unknown , there are several potential explanations for such interval cancers .
first , precancerous or cancerous lesions may have been missed at the time of colonoscopy.30 withdrawal time and technique deserve special consideration in this context , as the detection rate of colorectal neoplasia depends on the withdrawal time during colonoscopy .
barclay et al.31 demonstrated that a withdrawal time 6 min is strongly correlated with an increased adenoma detection rate ( adr ) .
in addition , careful inspection of the oral side of the mucosal folds is more important than simple adherence to a standard withdrawal time , especially in the proximal colon.32,33 the adr itself is also an important quality indicator for predicting the risk of interval cancers after screening colonoscopy .
kaminski et al.17 demonstrated that the adr of endoscopist was significantly associated with the risk of interval cancer ( p=0.008 ) .
endoscopies with an adr of less than 11.0% were associated with a 10.94-fold ( 95% ci , 1.37 - 87.01 ) higher risk of interval cancer than endoscopies with an adr of 20.0% or higher .
complete colonoscopy , another quality indicator of colonoscopy , is also associated with the risk of interval cancer.9 in a previous study conducted in new zealand , 9 of 17 interval cancers occurred after an incomplete colonoscopy.34 brenner et al.21 also showed that 18% of interval cancers were associated with the completeness of the preceding negative colonoscopy . in this study , interestingly , incompleteness of colonoscopy was associated with distal interval cancers as well as proximal interval cancers , which was explained by a strong association between incompleteness and other aspects of colonoscopy quality , including the miss rate in the distal colon .
non - polypoid lesions , which have a subtle endoscopic appearance , may be more easily missed , especially by endoscopists with lower adr and in inadequate bowel preparations.13 previous several studies showed that non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers share some common features:15,19,35,36 both lesions are common in the proximal colon,15,19,35 and interval cancers have a flat appearance.36 although the relationship between non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers has not yet been clarified , endoscopists should be careful not to miss non - polypoid lesions during colonoscopy , especially in the right - sided colon .
second , interval cancers may develop from the incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 the recent complete adenoma resection study showed that complete resection of neoplasia is far less common than previously thought.37 in the complete adenoma resection study , the incomplete resection rate varied broadly ( 6.5 - 22.7% ) among endoscopists , and was significantly higher in large and sessile lesions .
robertson et al.38 showed that 26% of interval cancers occur in the same anatomic segments as those of a previous polypectomy , suggesting a possible role for incomplete polypectomy in the development of interval cancers .
a dietary polyp prevention trial showed a similar rate of interval cancers after incomplete polypectomy.36 in this trial , in 4 of 13 patients , interval cancers were associated with incomplete polypectomy .
lieberman et al.39 showed that the 5-year interval cancer rate after a normal colonoscopy without polypectomy is 0.17% , whereas the 5-year interval cancer rate after a previous polypectomy is 1.5% .
these findings suggest that interval cancers that develop from lesions are visualized and recognized but are incompletely removed during a prior colonoscopic polypectomy .
third , different biological factors associated with molecular carcinogenesis may contribute to the development of interval cancers , especially in the proximal colon.40,41 arain et al.40 showed that interval cancers are more likely to arise in the right colon and have microsatellite instability ( msi ) and cpg island methylator phenotypes ( cimp ) than non - interval cancers . in multivariable logistic regression model , msi ( or : 2.7 ; 95% ci : 1.1 - 6.8 ) and cimp ( or : 2.41 ; 95% ci : 1.2 - 4.9 ) were independently associated with interval cancers .
sawhney et al.41 showed that interval cancers were 3.7 times more likely to show msi than non - interval cancers , and shaukat et al.42 showed that braf mutation is not associated with interval cancers .
however , these three studies were limited as they were conducted by the same author group using the same samples . therefore , additional studies on the molecular characteristics of interval cancers are warranted .
finally , the serrated pathway for carcinogenesis of crc has recently been the focus of studies , as sessile , serrated adenomas ( ssas ) have a malignant potential that is at least as high or higher than the malignant potential of conventional adenomas.43,44 ssas are usually difficult to detect by colonoscopy , as they are often located in the right colon with a sessile configuration and an inconspicuous border .
colonoscopists often face difficulties in recognizing and completely removing ssas , and as a result , a subset of these lesions potentially progress to interval cancers .
ssas share common features with interval cancers , such as right colon predominance , msi , and a cimp - high phenotype.44 in a multicenter study involving 32 endoscopy centers,45 the detection of proximal serrated lesions varied greatly among endoscopy centers ( p<0.0001 ) , and there was also substantial variation among pathologists in the identification of sessile , serrated lesions .
fortunately , clinically significantly serrated polyps may be easier to detect with longer withdrawal times.46 the new hampshire colonoscopy registry study showed that a withdrawal time of 9 min resulted in a nearly 30% relative increase in serrated polyp detection.46 therefore , systemic education programs on serrated lesions as well as colonoscopy quality may improve the recognition and diagnosis of serrated lesions .
recent evidence suggests that interval cancers are caused by a deficiency in the quality of colonoscopy rather than accelerated tumor biology.12,19 this is good news , as most interval cancers may be prevented by improving colonoscopy quality .
first , as described above , interval cancers may develop from suboptimal quality indicators such as withdrawal time , adr , complete colonoscopy , and bowel preparation , as well as incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 in addition , the identification of serrated lesions may be improved with longer withdrawal time.46 second , the grade , stage , histology , and survival patterns do not differ between patients with interval cancer and those with non - interval cancer , which does not suggest an aggressive biology , but rather that the majority represent missed lesions.25,47 in a danish population - based registry,25 982 danish individuals with interval cancers were compared to two reference groups , namely , 358 individuals with crc identified more than 10 years after a colonoscopy and 35,707 individuals with crc but no prior colonoscopy . in this study ,
no significant differences were found in the characteristics of patients and tumors or survival between interval cancers and cancers arising more than 10 years after colonoscopy.25 the adjusted mortality rate ratios of interval cancers to non - interval cancers were 0.92 and 1.0 after 1 years and 5 years , respectively.25 finally , cases of missed cancer are more common when the colonoscopy is performed by non - gastroenterologists.12,48 a recent canadian registry study12 showed that endoscopist specialty remains a significant predictor of missed cancers despite adjustment for procedural volume .
rabeneck et al.48 also showed that non - gastroenterologists have a significantly higher rate of missed cancers than gastroenterologists , independent of procedural volume .
the lack of an association between colonoscopy volume and missed cancers may indicate that even non - gastroenterologists who handle a high volume of procedures continue to miss more crcs than gastroenterologists .
it may also indicate that formal endoscopic training generally leads to competency in colonoscopy , whereas providers who do not receive formal training are unable to achieve competence despite the volume of procedures they perform.12,47,48 a higher rate of interval cancers associated with index colonoscopies performed by general practice physicians was also found in studies from ontario and indiana.15,49 emerging evidence suggests a link between endoscopist specialty and colonoscopy quality in korea.50 to the best of our knowledge , there is no formal curriculum or guidelines in colonoscopy training for general practice physicians in korea .
therefore , more stringent standards for training and assessment of colonoscopy quality are necessary to cope with the risk of interval cancer .
generally , plaintiffs often allege inadequate performance of colonoscopy as the proximate cause of the interval cancer . to date ,
there is no published data on malpractice claims related with interval cancer . a review of malpractice claims filed with the physicians insurers association of america ( database queried between 1985 and 2008 ) determined that colonoscopy represents the highest frequency ( 41.5% ) of closed claims and the highest total indemnities ( $ 54,093,000 ) among gastrointestinal endoscopy claims.51 indeed , there was an average increase of 15.5% per year in total claim payments associated with colonoscopy , and the majority resulted from inadequate performance of an endoscopic procedure , followed by diagnosis error ( may include cases of interval cancer ) .
in korea , a review of malpractice claims reported from the korea consumer agency ( database queried between 2009 and 2011 ) determined an increase of 205% in total claim consultations.52 in addition , the rate of diagnostic error for crcs was 6.8% of all cases of cancers associated with diagnostic errors .
these data do not provide detailed information about interval cancer ; however , out anecdotal impression is that lawsuits alleging missed cancers are increasing .
given the increased use of colonoscopy , the number of medicolegal litigation related to interval cancers would be logically expected to increase .
colonoscopists are encouraged to reduce their risk by documenting the limitations of colonoscopy in the informed consent process and their data of colonoscopy quality ( e.g. , cecal intubation , bowel preparation , and withdrawal time ) .
colonoscopists commonly discuss the complications of the procedure ; however , they seldom discuss the possibility of missed lesions and failure to prevent interval cancers.16 colonoscopy is not considered a perfect method by colonoscopists or by patients .
informed consent may shift the burden of this reality from the colonoscopists to the patients .
maintenance of an adequate level of colonoscopy quality indicators and detection of non - polypoid lesions , including ssas , especially in the right colon , may minimize the risk of medicolegal litigation related with interval cancer .
considering the significant number of interval cancers that are encountered in daily clinical practice , the importance of adequate training and improvement of colonoscopy quality as causative factors in interval cancers should be highlighted .
continuous monitoring of colonoscopy quality , which is amenable to improvement , can not be overstated to prevent the occurrence of interval cancers .","INTRODUCTION

"primary pancreatic lymphoma is rare , comprising 0.2~4.9% of all pancreatic malignancies and less than 1% of non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl)2 - 4 ) .
treatment and prognosis of these tumors are different . however , the diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma is very difficult , because the clinical symptoms and signs resemble those of pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
we report a rare presentation of diffuse large b cell lymphoma , appearing as a primary tumor of the pancreas .
a 61-year old female was admitted to the hospital with the complaint of right upper abdominal pain in february 2003 . on admission ,
the patient had a temperature of 36.9 , blood pressure of 115/58 mmhg , and a pulse of 68 beats per minute .
physical examination revealed a palpable non - tender mass in the right upper abdomen and icteric sclera .
the hemoglobin was 8.2 g / dl with 6,400 leukocytes / mm and 247,000 platelets / mm . the alanine aminotransferase was 129
u / l ( normal range ( nr ) , 5 - 40 u / l ) and aspartate aminotransferase was 65
u / l ( nr , 35 - 129 u / l ) and gamma - glutamyltranspeptidase was 212 u / l ( nr , 8 - 61 u / l ) . the total bilirubin was 16 mg / dl with 12 mg / dl of direct bilirubin . the serum carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 ( ca19 - 9 ) was 36.9 u / ml ( nr , 0 - 37 u / ml ) .
the abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a hypoechoic 3.4 cm sized mass located at the head of pancreas ; there was dilatation of the bile duct and the gallbladder appeared to be filled with sludge .
computed tomography ( ct ) of the abdomen showed a well defined mass located at the head of the pancreas which was slightly enhanced during the arterial phase ( figure 1 ) .
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) revealed stenosis of the distal common bile duct by extrinsic compression .
percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed because of the clinical signs of fever and leukocytosis , suggesting acute cholangitis .
laparotomy was performed , revealing a prominent mass located at the head of the pancreas accumulated with the duodenum and the portal area .
a frozen section of pancreas revealed lymphoma and partial excision of the mass located at the pancreatic head was performed instead of the whipple procedure .
microscopic examination revealed a malignant lymphoma which consisted of large anaplastic lymphocytes ( figure 2a ) .
tumor cells showed strong membrane staining for the b cell marker protein ( cd20 ) and were negative for the t cell marker protein ( cd3 ) ( figure 2b ) . therefore , according to the ann arbor classification , the patient had stage ie disease .
six cycles of chop chemotherapy ( cyclophophamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ) were administered without any further complications .
follow - up abdominal ct showed no visible mass in the pancreas ( figure 3 ) .
nhl frequently occurs at extranodal sites , most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract and rarely in the pancreas5 ) . in this case the criteria for the definition for primary pancreatic lymphoma as used by behrns and associates , were satisfied7 ) .
these criteria include : no superficial or mediastinal adenopathy , normal leukocyte count , and findings confined to peripancreatic disease ( ann arbor stage i or ii ) without hepatic or splenic involvement6 , 7 ) .
clinical manifestations of pancreatic lymphoma include abdominal pain ( 75% ) , a palpable abdominal mass ( 54% ) , weight loss ( 50% ) , jaundice ( 40% ) , night sweats ( 22% ) and fever ( 20%)3 , 6 ) .
double - contrast enhanced spiral ct is the imaging modality of choice and demonstrates the presence of a pancreatic mass in virtually all patients6 ) .
lymphoma should be suspected in the presence of a large , rapidly growing pancreatic mass4 , 8) .
it is unlikely to have a pancreatic adenocarcinoma above 10 cm in size ; about 60% of pancreatic lymphomas are greater than 6 cm in diameter3 ) .
the presence of lymphadenopathy in the peri - pancreatic area , splenomegaly and as well as a large tumor , generally without encasement of the superior mesenteric artery , are suggestive of lymphoma .
the location of the tumor in the pancreas does not appear to be helpful in determining whether the mass is carcinoma or lymphoma . in the absence of any pathognomonic clinical or radiological features
the use of a ct guided fine needle aspiration ( fna ) has the advantage of not requiring an open surgical procedure but has the disadvantages of sampling error , difficulty in evaluating obtained sample ( false positive / false negative ) and the inability to subclassify the lymphoma3 , 5 ) . in a review of 269 percutaneous biopsies of pancreatic lesions with ct or ultrasound guidance ,
the combined accuracy in the diagnosis of malignancy was 93% , major complications were seen in three cases and no biopsy related death occurred9 , 11 ) .
recently , endoscopic ultrasonography with fna has also been used successfully to identify and biopsy pancreatic lymphoma6 , 10 ) .
open biopsy of the pancreas provides more tissue and allows direct visualization of the lesion and other abdominal organs and lymph nodes , but carries the morbidity and mortality associated with a surgical procedure3 ) . with the availability of less invasive diagnostic modalities , operating to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis
should be reserved for the rare instance when all other available modalities have failed to provide a final tissue diagnosis6 ) .
advised a more aggressive surgical approach including pancreatic resection or tumor debulking , in view of the poor survival rate with radiotherapy and chemotherapy7 ) .
currently , many institutions with a large experience of operative management for pancreatic disease have reported mortality rates of 5% or less after major pancreatic resection with an acceptable morbidity rate of 30%6 , 8) . however webb et al .
reported that no evidence supported a role for extensive resection in the management of patents with pancreatic lymphoma , and that the majority of patients should be managed with chemotherapy and without surgery4 , 8) .
extensive surgery frequently causes a variety of complications which may prevent patients from receiving chemotherapy .
radiation remains a suggested general adjuvant to chemotherapy to increase the local control regardless of anatomic location6 ) .
bouvet and colleagues reported the use of radiation therapy in all cases of lymphoma of the pancreas not treated with surgery ; they reported four of eight patients with long term survival after standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy5 ) .
local failure either from residual or recurrent disease has been noted by multiple authors and accounts for more than 85% of deaths ( 28 of 32 ) . because of these frequent local failures
therefore , it is very important to establish a definitive diagnosis and stage of disease , to plan the modality of treatment .
the range of survival time is wide and few conclusions are available since the data is not directly comparable3 ) .
the primary treatment for patients in whom the diagnosis of lymphoma can be established , with minimally invasive techniques , is combination chemotherapy with involved - field radiotherapy5 ) .
surgical resection may play a beneficial role in the treatment of localized pancreatic lymphoma6 ) .
lymphoma is an uncommon cause of obstructive jaundice , and the management for this diagnosis is controversial .
operative decompression of the bile ducts , with biliary - enteric bypass , has been recommended as it allows for rapid resolution of jaundice before initiation of chemotherapy .
others have observed equally rapid resolution of jaundice with a short course of radiotherapy or nonhepatotoxic chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide and prednisone ) .
nhl is curable in more than 50% of patients with anthracycline containing combination chemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy .
webb et al . reported complete remission in six of nine patients treated with chemotherapy at a median follow - up of 24 months . in another report ,
a 40% relapse - free survival was reported in 14 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation6 , 8 , 11 ) .
adnan et al . reported that all five patients studied achieved a complete remission , and only one relapsed at 12 months after treatment ; while the others remain in remission at 84 , 26 , 24 and 21 months11 ) .
it is important to differentiate between primary lymphoma and the more common adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as treatment and prognosis differ significantly .
primary pancreatic lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors and an attempt to obtain tissue diagnosis is always necessary before proceeding to radical surgery , especially on young patients .","INTRODUCTION

"tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf ) antagonists are an effective treatment for a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases , and they are commonly administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis . however , in some cases , treatment with tnf antagonists induces the onset of a new autoimmune disease . as these agents are being used for an expanding number of diseases and for longer periods , this phenomenon has also been increasingly noticed .
these agents have been reported to induce lupus , vasculitis , interstitial lung disease , psoriasis , sarcoidosis , autoimmune hepatitis and myopathy [ 1 , 2 ] .
sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas , and although it primarily affects the lungs and lymph nodes , any organ may be involved .
induced sarcoidosis has been reported in association with infliximab , etanercept and adalimumab [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] .
certolizumab is a new tnf antagonist which has been proven to be effective in the treatment of ra .
a review of the literature revealed no previous occurrence of sarcoidosis induced by this agent .
we report the first case of certolizumab - induced uveitis , highly suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis , and review the literature relevant to the pathogenesis of this adverse effect .
a 64-year - old woman was referred to our clinic due to bilateral reduced visual acuity ( va ) , mainly in her left eye .
the patient 's medical history was significant for seropositive ra , which had been well controlled for the previous 3 years under treatment with methotrexate and certolizumab ( cimzia ) .
the patient complained of a mild reduction in va in both eyes during the previous year and noticed a significant reduction in her left eye ( which occurred 1 week prior to her presentation ) .
initial examination revealed a va of 20/32 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye .
anterior segment examination revealed no corneal keratic precipitates , mild ( + 1 ) flare in the anterior chambers and posterior synechiae bilaterally ( fig .
dilated fundus examination revealed vitreal cells and haze , which were present bilaterally , but more distinct in the left eye .
1c , d ) and peripheral retinal punched - out lesions were visible ( fig .
intraocular pressure ( iop ) was 21 mm hg in the right eye and 30 mm hg in the left eye .
the integration of the clinical signs at presentation led to a working diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis , possibly associated with anti - tnf treatment .
angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) levels were mildly elevated ( 61 u / l , normal range 1051 u / l ) .
physical examinations and chest x - rays were normal , and so was the pulmonary function test .
the patient was also examined by an expert pulmonologist who ruled out any lung disease .
she was treated with topical steroid drops as well as anti - glaucoma medication . by doing so
, an improvement of the anterior uveitis and a normalization of the iop were achieved . in coordination with the rheumatologist ,
two months after the discontinuation of certolizumab , the uveitis had decreased and va had improved to 20/32 in both eyes . nevertheless , the macular edema persisted and the patient underwent periocular injections of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide ( triesence ; alcon inc . ) in both eyes , with a partial resolution of the macular edema ( fig .
one year after her initial presentation , the patient 's ra is well controlled , and the change in systemic treatment did not result in any exacerbation .
her va remains 20/32 in both eyes , and iop is 17 mm hg in both eyes ( under topical treatment ) .
the macular edema has improved , but still remains significant and is likely the cause of her impaired va ( fig .
tnf has a significant role in the pathogenesis of granulomas ; tnf antagonists have been reported to be effective in the treatment of refractory sarcoidosis .
it is therefore paradoxical that such agents would also induce sarcoidosis , but this complication has been previously documented [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] .
tnf-induced sarcoidosis may not demonstrate all the systemic manifestations of the disease and may involve only 1 organ .
several case reports have been published describing pulmonary [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] or cutaneous [ 10 , 11 ] sarcoidosis following treatment with tnf antagonists .
it is a recombinant , polyethylene glycolylated , antigen - binding fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets and neutralizes tnf .
infliximab and adalimumab are monoclonal antibodies directed toward tnf , and etanercept is a tnf - receptor - fusion protein conjugated to the fc portion of human igg .
certolizumab is essentially different from these other tnf antagonists since it is not a full antibody and does not include an fc portion that may be immunogenic .
our patient had no previous history of sarcoidosis and had not received any other tnf antagonists that may have induced it .
the patient presented with 4 ocular signs of sarcoidosis ( synechiae , vitreous opacities , multiple peripheral chorioretinal lesions and a bilaterality of involvement ) , associated with a mildly elevated ace . according to the international criteria for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis ,
3 suggestive intraocular signs and 2 positive investigational tests are required to diagnose a probable ocular sarcoidosis .
since our patient had no other typical signs and only 1 positive test , a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis could not be made with any certainty , but it was evident that significant bilateral uveitis was present and the constellation of ocular findings and elevated ace are suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis .
the fact that the onset of ocular involvement followed the initiation of certolizumab supports the observation that the uveitis was induced by this agent and improved after its cessation .
although uveitis is a possible complication of ra , the ocular findings in this case are not typical for ra , but instead are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis .
it is worthwhile to note that the simultaneous occurrence of ra and sarcoidosis is extremely rare .
these facts further imply certolizumab as the cause of induced uveitis in this patient . following cessation of certolizumab ,
the macular edema did not resolve completely ; however , residual edema may persist after the inflammatory process is stopped , and in this patient , it is also possible that the presence of an epiretinal membrane precluded its complete resorption .
the patient had a normal chest x - ray and pulmonary function ; only her eyes were involved in the induced inflammation .
for this reason , there was also no way to perform a biopsy to pathologically demonstrate the diagnosis of sarcoidosis .
it should be noted that sarcoidosis may involve any organ   or it can be limited to the eyes only . the same is true for induced sarcoidosis , which may be limited to 1 organ [ 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] .
for example , it has been reported to present very atypically and involve just the hypopharynx .
this is the first case report of induced uveitis , suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis , secondary to treatment with certolizumab .
ocular involvement associated with autoimmune disease induced by tnf antagonists is relatively rare , and ocular involvement from tnf-induced sarcoidosis has only been reported once .
cessation of certolizumab resulted in gradual improvement and should be recommended in similar cases ; its use caused a new autoimmune disease .
it should be noted that the patient required additional topical treatment as well as periorbital injections of steroids ; extraocular involvement may have required systemic therapy .
rheumatologists and ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility of induced uveitis by tnf antagonists , and this case report demonstrates that this complication may also occur with certolizumab .
rheumatologists should also be aware that it may only involve 1 organ and inquire about changes in va .
they should refer their patients for an ophthalmic examination if any ocular involvement is suspected .","Introduction

"the determination of a biomolecule 's complete three - dimensional structure provides invaluable information about the molecule 's function , and how that function might be modulated .
unfortunately , determining protein or nucleic - acid structures from the molecules themselves is difficult owing to physical impediments . likewise
, accurate computational prediction of such structures from physical principles remains computationally intractable owing to the overwhelming number of degrees of freedom in the system .
techniques that can determine constraints on the potential molecular conformations can dramatically improve the chances of determining structures with both measured and predictive methods .
one possible method for predicting physical proximity is to examine large families of sequences that have presumably similar structures , and to catalog positional pairs that show correlation between the identities of the residues occupying them .
this calculation produces a four - dimensional matrix of positions , identities , related positions and strengths of relationship . for a small rna molecule of 80
nt , this 4d matrix contains 160  000 values , while a small protein of 300 amino acids produces a cross - correlation matrix containing 39  690  000 values .
since there is no single value or distinctly definable pattern amongst these values that signals a structural relationship , an abstraction that allows the expert researcher to visualize , interpret and query the matrix is clearly necessary ( ) .
mavl / stickwrld was developed to visualize interpositional dependencies within nucleic acid and amino acid sequence alignments ( 1,2 ) . in this representation ,
a positional weight matrix representing the alignment is wrapped around a cylinder by placing spheres for each identity and position .
the diameters of the spheres are proportional to the percentage frequency of the corresponding identity .
the diameter of the sticks is based on the over - representation or under - representation of sequences sharing these identities as compared with a weight - matrix - based expectation for the sequences as a family .
this visualization method allows the researcher to detect patterns of pairwise positional dependencies easily , and comment on possible structural implications of these observations . in this paper , we present a complete rewrite of mavl / stickwrld in java3d ( ) .
the new implementation has three significant areas of improvement over the vrml version : enhanced real - time user interaction ; clustering of residues by aggregate physicochemical properties and availability of pre - calculated stickwrld wrlds for all families in the pfam database ( 3 ) .
our java3d implementation leaves the computationally intensive calculation of the complete interpositional correlation matrix on the server , but moves the selection of features for display , to the client applet running on the user 's computer .
it is no - longer necessary to completely re - compute the correlation matrix to change display preferences .
therefore the user interface is no longer limited to a static graph with pre - applied statistical and display parameter choices .
instead , the various stickwrld statistical parameters ( tr , the global over / underpopulation threshold ; pr , the per - edge overpopulation threshold ; nr , the per - edge underpopulation threshold ; and alpha , the edge - significance threshold ) , and display parameters such as residue coloring and grouping can be adjusted by the user on - the - fly .
this allows the parameters to be adjusted to suit the complexity of the alignment being visualized , and the user can now toggle between coarse visualization parameters to quickly explore and locate interesting features of an alignment , and fine parameters to investigate detailed aspects of the relationship . to allow the system to more intuitively deal with the potentially weak relationships amongst poorly constrained sequences ,
this allows , for example , the conserved residue properties and interpositional requirements of distant homologs to be discovered , even in the absence of specifically conserved residues .
residues can currently be grouped by hydropathy , charge and volume , and the relationship between these aggregate properties at each position visualized , just as the specific sequence identities can be . using this option in many protein families results in the discovery of correlated physical properties , even when the contributing residue identities fall below the significance threshold , or are obscured by other more dramatic individual - residue relationships .
finally , we are interested in the distribution of the variety of interpositional relationships highlighted by mavl / stickwrld , amongst known sequence families . to facilitate access to this information , and to make it easier for researchers to examine popular sequence families
, we have pre - computed stickwrld wrlds for the complete pfam database of sequence families .
the pfam alignments , and the wrlds generated from them , are available directly from the mavl / stickwrld java interface .
we currently house 7868 sequence families ( the average number of sequences per family is 23 and average sequence length is 227 ) from pfam , and we update the stickwrld database regularly .
some interesting statistics have come out of our examination of this data collection : the average number of possible correlations per family is approximately 1  000  000 . on average , 5% of these display over / underpopulations > 10% of expected population ( tr > 0.10 ) .
however , > 60% of those with tr > 0.10 have a significance better than 0.0001 .
this strongly suggests that many of the relationships highlighted by mavl analysis are biologically relevant , rather than simple random outliers discovered by the massive number of correlations considered .
the above improvements in the implementation result in fast , easy and accurate examinations of sequence families . enhanced user interaction and availability of pre - calculated stickwrld wrlds for pfam alignments provide fast and convenient analysis .
grouping of the residues based on physicochemical properties supplies more information on conserved patterns within families . applying mavl / stickwrld to a typical protein domain results in improved understanding of the interacting residues , and the physical properties required to maintain structure or function .
figure 1 shows stickwrld representations and corresponding three - dimensional protein structures for the pfam family of integrin alpha cytoplasmic regions ( pdb 1m8o shown ) .
this family contains the short cytoplasmic region of integrin alpha chains , and has small , strongly conserved -helix , followed by a generally acidic region ( 4,5 ) .
mavl / stickwrld analysis ( figure 1a ) suggests that there are two alternative preferred sequences within the family { r9 p10 p11 q12 e13 } or { y9 k10 m12}. that is , while the canonical structure contains an -helix , terminating in r9 and broken by prolines at p10 and p11 , there is an alternate sequence motif that contains neither p10 nor p11 , but instead a preferred tyrosine , lysine , methionine triplet at { 9 , 10 , 12}. a tutorial on reading the stickwrld diagrams produced by the java version is available from the mavl / stickwrld help - files page ( ) .
furthermore , grouping of the residues by charge , to elucidate bulk - property - related propensities ( figure 1b , 1c ) reveals more molecular preferences of the distinct sequence subfamilies .
the turn following the -helix of the cytoplasmic domain appears to be stabilized by either 5 residues following the pattern { 9 + , 10np , 11np , 12p , 13 } or 8 residues { 8 + , 9p , 10 + , 11 , 12np , 13np , 14p , 15 } ( + : positively charged , :negatively charged , p : polar , np : nonpolar ) there is also a preference in the first pattern for a slightly polar residue at 2 , and against a non - polar residue at this position . a high - resolution copy of figure 1 , as well as links to live versions of the java stickwrld diagram are available from the mavl / stickwrld help - files page ( ) .
strongly conserved ( consensus ) residues of this small domain are colored and labeled in figure 1d , and participate in the 10-residue n - terminal -helix of the domain .
acidic , and do not capture the sequence or property requirements , or suggest their involvement in stabilizing the hairpin .
it is clear that the positively charged arginine and negatively charged glutamate are brought together by the hairpin , and can act in concert to stabilize the hairpin with the support of other polar and non - polar residues . while crystal or solution structures are not available for any non - proline - motif integrin alpha domains , we predict that the alternative positive residues at 8 and 10 , and negative residues at 11 and 15 will be found to interact similarly to stabilize the domain structure .
mavl / stickwrld 's new java interface provides rapid exploration of alignment properties and insight into potential structural requirements that are embedded in the sequence identities .
the analysis and visualization method has proven both intuitive and accurate for predicting likely structural features in protein and nucleic acid families for which representative crystal or solution structures are known .
we are developing additional utilities to assist the researcher by providing automatic suggested partitions of sequence families into subgroups , and are actively extending our pre - computed analysis database so that researchers may mine other interesting structural features from the pfam families database .
