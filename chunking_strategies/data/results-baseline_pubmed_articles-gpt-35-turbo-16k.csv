How were participants screened for exclusion in the study on long-term fitness trends and type 2 diabetes?,"Participants were excluded if they had diabetes, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, tuberculosis, gastrointestinal disease, or if they had not completed at least four submaximal exercise tests in the 7 years prior to 1985.","Participants were screened for exclusion based on the presence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, tuberculosis, or gastrointestinal disease.","['coefficient of 0.92 ( 16 ) . furthermore , we used values obtained in oral glucose tolerance tests or fasting blood glucose levels as objective measures of the study outcome , type 2 diabetes . individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes , such as those with impaired glucose tolerance or obesity , have been studied in randomized controlled trials of lifestyle , including physical activity and type 2 diabetes ( 810 ) . however , there are no data in low - risk populations . in addition , most of the data have been in caucasian subjects . type 2 diabetes is a global problem ; thus , data are needed not only in high - risk populations but also in low - risk populations and in other racial / ethnic groups . one limitation of the present study is that subjects may not be representative of the entire japanese population and women were not included . another limitation is that possible changes in fitness levels were taken into account between 1979 and 1985 but not during the follow - up period , 19851999 . however , not accounting for changes during the latter period would probably dilute the true association between fitness and the risk of developing diabetes . in conclusion , this cohort study showed a strong inverse relationship between long - term trends in fitness and the development of type 2 diabetes in japanese men . this relationship was independent of age , initial fitness level , bmi , systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , and a family history of diabetes . thus , regular physical activity , which is associated with an increase or preservation of fitness , should be promoted by health professionals , because it decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes , in addition to decreasing the risks of many chronic diseases ( 17 ) .', 'the annual health checkup included measurement of height , body weight , and blood pressure and a urinary glucose test . , participants were followed for the development of type 2 diabetes , which was based on any one of the following three diagnostic parameters : 1 ) plasma glucose levels exceeded 11.1 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl ) 2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test , conducted in men with urinary glucose detected at a follow -

What clinical consequences can anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) lead to according to the article?,"Clinical consequences can range from relatively mild to serious adverse events such as anaphylaxis, cytokine release syndrome, and cross-reactive neutralization of endogenous proteins mediating critical functions.","The clinical consequences of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) can range from relatively mild to serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis, cytokine release syndrome, and cross-reactive neutralization of endogenous proteins mediating critical functions. ADAs can also affect drug efficacy and biodistribution, drug clearance, and complicate the interpretations of toxicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data.","['therapeutic proteins and peptides have potential to elicit immune responses [ 1 , 2 ] , resulting in anti - drug antibodies ( adas ) that can pose problems for both patient safety and product efficacy . clinical consequences can range from relatively mild to serious adverse events [ 35 ] , such as anaphylaxis , cytokine release syndrome , and cross - reactive neutralization of endogenous proteins mediating critical functions . ada can affect drug efficacy and biodistribution and drug clearance , and complicate the interpretations of toxicity and pharmacokinetic ( pk ) and pharmacodynamic ( pd ) data [ 68 ] . during drug development immunogenicity is examined by risk - based approach along with specific strategies for developing fit - for - purpose bioanalytical approaches . enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) and electrochemiluminescence ( ecl ) immunoassays are the most widely used platform for ada detection due to their high sensitivity and throughput . lower affinity ada can be detected by surface plasmon resonance , biolayer interferometry , or other platforms . typically , detection of ada is followed by assessments of the magnitude ( titer ) of the ada response and the in vitro neutralizing ability of ada , especially in late - stage clinical studies . additional characterization of ada such as immunoglobulin subclass or isotype determinations , domain - mapping , relative binding affinity , cross - reactivity with endogenous proteins , or complement activating ability of the ada may be driven by product - specific , indication - specific , or risk assessment - based objectives [ 9 , 12 , 13 ] . recommendations for ada assay development , method validation , and testing strategies have been published by the ligand - binding assay bioanalytical focus group ( lbabfg ) of american association of pharmaceutical scientists ( aaps ) [ 10 , 12 , 1416 ] . additionally , scientific publications on risk - based approaches to immunogenicity assessments [ 9 , 12 , 1719 ] and regulatory documents from the us food and drug administration ( fda ) and the european medicine agency ( ema ) are also available [ 2023 ] . together , these documents provide ample guidance for the application of appropriate ada detection methods in clinical studies . since the late 1990s , liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( lc / ms )', 'anti - n - methyl - d - aspartate ( anti - nmda ) receptor encephalitis is an acute , immune - mediated paraneoplastic syndrome with a characteristic sequential clinical course . it includes a prodrome of flu - like illness progressing to behavior changes , psychosis , and memory deficit . dyskinesia , seizure attacks , deteriorated consciousness level , and autonomic instability may be seen in later stages.14 patients may gradually recover , with these symptoms resolving in reverse order.14 dalmau s group first described anti - nmda receptor encephalitis in 2005 and suggested that it was an acute , female - predominant ( 81% ) autoimmune encephalitis.1,2 about half of the patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis had underlying neoplasms , with ovarian teratomas ( 94% ) being the most common.13 a recent large cohort study demonstrated that milder severity of symptoms , no need for intensive care , early immunotherapy , and prompt tumor removal were good prognostic factors.3 half of the patients had improvement in symptoms within 4 weeks after early immunotherapy . in another case report , the authors noted that steroid usage 3 months after onset of symptoms also resulted in significant improvements.3,5 the recovery phase might last for 18 months or longer.34 to maximize a patient s functional outcome , clinical practitioners need to be aware of this potentially curable disease and its common sequelae in order to organize rational , individualized rehabilitation programs.6,7 we report the long - term course of a young pediatric patient with recalcitrant anti - nmda receptor encephalitis and prolonged length of stay in hospital for 7 months . a young girl aged 3 years 2 months and without known medical or psychiatric history was admitted to our hospital due to personality changes that had persisted for 2 weeks . her condition progressed over the course of 12 days to behavioral regression , unsteady gait , headache , irritable crying , catatonia - like response , generalized choreoathetoid movements , orofacial dyskinesia , and collapsed lung , in successive order . as a result , she was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit . her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white - matter lesions over bilateral frontal lobes ( figure 1 ) . a complete etiologic', 'ab capture approach may not be used if the biotherapeutic proteins contain constant human fc regions . unlike using drug as capture reagent , anti - drug ab captures both free drug and drug - ada complexes and during the ada elution step drug is also eluted out from magnetic beads and thus interferes with lc / ms detection . for instance , humira ( adalimumab ) , a tnf inhibiting anti - inflammatory drug and the first fully human monoclonal antibody drug approved by the fda , is an igg1 made by phage display technology with amino acid sequences only from the human germline , making it indistinguishable in structure and function from natural human igg1 . based on in silicon digestion prediction , humira would yield the universal peptides of human igg1 , gpsvfplapssk , and thus interfere with the universal peptide ada assay . in this case , unique peptide(s ) from the drug instead of the ada peptides might be monitored by lc / ms and the results can be qualitatively correlated to ada , as neubert et al . reported . another option is to use the first immunocapture approach with biotinylated drug as the ada capture reagent . we demonstrated for the first time that immunocapture - lc / ms can be used for simultaneous ada isotyping and semiquantitation in human plasma . either biotinylated drug or biotinylated anti - drug ab could be used as the immunocapture reagent , each with its own merits and shortfalls . biotinylated drug can readily capture ada but drug interference could be an issue if drug levels in the samples are high . on the other hand , immunocapture using an anti - drug ab eliminates drug interference , providing that the ab is able to capture drug - ada complex in addition to free drug . with this method , unique peptides from each ada isotype / subclass were identified and monitored by lc / ms . similar to traditional drug - bridging elisa assay , cut - points at 95% were established . the assay was used for screening , isotyping , and semiquantitating preexisting adas in human plasma . endogenous ig interferences need to be reduced in order to improve the assay sensitivity and specificity , and human positive ada controls will be needed for more accurate ada quantitation . owing to lc /', 'ada - drug or ada - drug - ab complexes after washing , ada is released from the beads and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by lc / ms detection of specific universal peptides for each ada isotype . protein z ( containing no human fc ) was a proprietary experimental biotherapeutic of boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals ( ridgefield , ct ) and produced in - house . the mouse anti - protein z monoclonal ab ( mab ) was supplied in - house . human igg1 , igg2 , igg3 , igg4 , and igm as well as bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) were purchased from sigma aldrich ( st . louis , mo ) , human ige was from mp biomedicals ( solon , oh ) , human iga1 was from abcam ( cambridge , ma ) , and human iga2 was from emd millipore ( billerica , ma ) . internal standard peptides with stable labeled c - terminal [ c6,n4]arg or [ c6,n2]lys were synthesized at genscript ( piscataway , nj ) . streptavidin magnetic beads ( 1 m dia . ) , tpck trypsin , and ez - link sulfo - nhs - lc biotinylation kits were obtained from thermo scientific ( rockford , il ) . all other lab chemicals , reagents , and buffer solutions were obtained from sigma aldrich , thermo scientific or invitrogen ( grand island , ny ) . human preexisting ada ( pea ) positive and negative plasma were obtained in - house . biotinylation of protein z and the mouse anti - protein z mab was performed using an ez - link sulfo - nhs - lc biotinylation kit . a 1 mg / ml solution of the drug or mab was combined with a 10-fold molar excess of biotin and allowed to react at room temperature for 60 minutes . a haba assay was used to determine the amount of biotin incorporation in the sample after desalting . typical biotin incorporation was approximately 2 biotins per drug and 47 biotins per mouse mab . the biotinylated drug and biotinylated mouse mab solutions were diluted to 0.1 mg / ml in water and stored at 80c prior to use . the magnetic beads ( 10 mg / ml ) were transferred to a polypropylene tube and placed on a magnetic stand to remove supernatant and collect the beads', 'nmda receptor encephalitis , the iq test showed no significant change except for performance iq improvement from 58 to 64 . she still had residual sequelae of mild mental retardation , and she had a mildly impulsive personality and was easily distracted . the typical presentations of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis could be divided into eight categories in decreasing order of prevalence , including acute behavioral or cognitive change , movement disorder , memory deficit , speech disorder , seizure , decreased level of consciousness , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation . in an observational cohort study , about 87% of patients shared similar symptoms that included four or more of the eight categories within the first 4 weeks.3 definite diagnosis for this disease was the presence of nmda receptor antibodies in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid ( 100% sensitivity ) or serum ( 85% sensitivity).2,3 reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid antibodies appeared to be correlated to a better clinical outcome.2,8 there were no correlations between different domains of symptoms , extent of disease progression , and brain mri findings , with only 33%50% of patients showing nonspecific abnormalities on standard mri.2,3 one recent functional mri study proposed that reduced functional connectivity between bilateral hippocampus may predict memory performance , and that extensive white - matter changes in diffusion tensor imaging might correlate to the disease severity.9 the acronym nmdar is useful as a mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis : n for nonspecific prodrome , r for respiration depression . early detection of this disease and confirmed diagnosis with nmda receptor antibodies ensures early intervention and better recovery . the recommended first - line immunotherapies were corticosteroid , intravenous immunoglobulin , and plasmaphoresis . about 60% of patients achieved good outcomes with minor functional deficits remaining after first - line therapy or tumor removal.3 the second - line immunotherapies , which include rituximab and cyclophosphamide , were recommended to be started if patients failed to respond to first - line therapies after no more than 4 weeks,2,3 and resulted in a response rate of approximately 78%.3 full recovery and fewer neurological relapses were more frequently seen in patients with teratoma that had been removed.2,3,10 the general relapsing rate was 12%24% within the first 2 years , and overall mortality rate was 4%9.5%.2,3 a search of relevant articles was conducted on pubmed (']"
What are the two most widely used platforms for ADA detection mentioned in the article?,The two most widely used platforms for ADA detection are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassays.,The two most widely used platforms for ADA detection mentioned in the article are immune-capture LC/MS and ELISA.,"['digest was assayed by lc / ms using ida . the ida setup consisted of mrm survey scan for the formation of tryptic peptides based on in silico prediction , followed by enhanced product ion scans to confirm peptide identity . only peptides that met all the criteria set forth as discussed above were included in the survey scan . peptide separation was achieved with a 20 min ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography ( uplc ) gradient program . the top 13 most sensitive peptides for each ada isotype / subclass from the neat solution digestion were selected as unique peptide candidates and carried on for further method development . of these peptides , either doubly or triply charged parent ions were the most abundant . upon collision activation in ms / ms , the multiple charged parent ions fragmented into single charged b - ions and y - ions and the most sensitive y - ions were selected . after suitable surrogate peptide candidates were identified , immunocapture was performed , and sensitivity and matrix interference were assessed for each mrm pair . one was to capture adas with biotinylated protein z , while the other was to capture drug - ada complexes with a biotinylated mouse mab . the workflow of the immunocapture - lc / ms assay is depictured in figure 1 . using drug as capture reagent is straightforward , similar to traditional drug - bridging ecl assays . after spiking to human plasma samples , biotinylated protein z bound to ada to form ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes . upon adding streptavidin magnetic beads , the ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes were immobilized on the beads and then separated from matrix using a magnet . after washing , adas were eluted from the beads and subjected to trypsin digestion followed by lc / ms analysis . the basis of this approach was that biotinylated protein z was able to capture adas of different isotypes / subclasses present in the samples and the adas can be detected by lc / ms as long as the ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes survived the washing steps . because there were no human ada standards available , commercial human igs were used as surrogates . although different in their variable regions , the surrogate human igs have the same constant regions as human adas and thus produce the unique peptides', ""was used for screening , isotyping , and semiquantitating preexisting adas in human plasma . endogenous ig interferences need to be reduced in order to improve the assay sensitivity and specificity , and human positive ada controls will be needed for more accurate ada quantitation . owing to lc / ms 's advantages such as high specificity , selectivity and reproducibility , wide dynamic range , and multiplexing capability , it is expected that , with further improvements , immunocapture - lc / ms will become an invaluable tool in immunogenicity assessment . it can be easily implemented in bioanalytical lab settings for routine ada isotyping and semiquantitation . as ada levels measured by immunocapture - lc / ms represent absolute amounts , one can compare ada isotype levels between samples , studies , and different biotherapeutics , providing that consistency in positive controls is achieved to determine recovery . database of such information could be gradually built and provide valuable insight to better understand immunogenicity and immunology of biotherapeutics ."", 'and the european medicine agency ( ema ) are also available [ 2023 ] . together , these documents provide ample guidance for the application of appropriate ada detection methods in clinical studies . since the late 1990s , liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( lc / ms ) has been a dominant tool for sensitive , accurate , and rapid analysis of small - molecule drugs , metabolites , and biomarkers . in recent years , lc / ms has emerged as a promising platform for quantitation of biotherapeutics and protein biomarkers in biological matrices [ 2527 ] . the vast majority of lc / ms -

Why do some researchers choose to detect lower affinity ADAs using platforms like surface plasmon resonance or biolayer interferometry?,"Lower affinity ADAs can be detected by surface plasmon resonance, biolayer interferometry, or other platforms, which may not be as effectively detected by ELISA or ECL immunoassays due to their high sensitivity and throughput requirements.",Some researchers choose to detect lower affinity ADAs using platforms like surface plasmon resonance or biolayer interferometry because these platforms have the ability to detect ADAs with lower affinity and provide more sensitive and specific results.,"['by drug tolerance issues when drug is present . this limitation may be overcome by using acid dissociation to break up the drug - ada complex and release ada . biotinylated drug is then added to the samples so that the biotinylated drug competes with the existing drug in forming ( biotinylated)drug - ada complexes . if the amount of the biotinylated drug is much more than that of existing drug which is usually determined with a pk assay , the drug interference is greatly reduced and assay sensitivity is improved . in ecl drug - bridging assays , one binding domain of ada has to bind to biotinylated drug while the other binds to sulfotagged drug in order to form ( biotinylated)drug - ada-(sulfotagged)drug complex and be detected . in the immunocapture - lc / ms assay , on the other hand , only one arm of ada needs to bind to biotinylated drug and the other can still bind to the unlabeled drug . therefore , drug interference is expected to be less in immunocapture - lc / ms assay platform . it should be noted that if drug contains the human ig fc region , it may also bind to the beads via nonspecific binding just like endogenous proteins and could contribute to interference in the lc / ms assay . on the other hand , biotinylated drug that binds to streptavidin beads will not be eluted out under the elution conditions due to very strong biotin - streptavidin interaction . the binding between streptavidin and biotin has long been regarded as the strongest , noncovalent , biological interaction known , with a dissociation constant kd in the order of 4 10 m . the bond forms very rapidly and is stable in wide ranges of ph and temperature [ 53 , 54 ] . it was evident that the results from the immunocapture -

ozaki mfg . co. , ltd . ) . for estimation of polymer content , dry weight was measured after cultivation by weighing the gel that had been dried at 60c for 2 h. statistical analysis was performed using kaleidagraph version 4.0 software . the adequacy of high g- and m - content fe - alginate films as culture substrates was investigated by cultivation of nhdf on the respective gels . in the initial stage of culture , the number of attached cells and cell morphology showed little difference between the two fe - alginates ( figures 1 and 2 ) . however , as culture time progressed , the number of attached cells on the high - g fe - alginate gel was notably higher than that on the high - m gels ( figure 1 ) . cells on the high - g fe - alginate film showed good spread morphology throughout the culture period ( figures 2(a)2(c ) ) . conversely , on the high - g fe - alginate film , many cells became detached from the substrate , while maintaining cell - cell association , after 8 days of culture ( figure 2(f ) ) . the protein adsorption ability of high - g and high - m alginate was investigated . quantitative analysis demonstrated that both types of gel had an equivalent ability to adsorb serum proteins ( figure 3(a ) ) . moreover , immunoblot analysis revealed the same degree of adsorption of vitronectin , the major cellular adhesion - related serum protein , on both alginate gels ( figure 3(b ) ) .', ""with a high m - content . it has also been reported that high - g ca - alginate forms more porous gels , and that the cross - linkages tend to be more stable over a longer period , than is the case for high - m alginate . in the case of fe - alginate , it is considered that the alginate composition can also influence the condition of the gel . however , the effects of fe - alginate substrate composition on gel properties and the growth of cultured cells have not been clarified . the aim of this study was to define the relationship between fe - alginate composition and the growth of cells cultured on fe - alginate films . we evaluated the efficiency of cell adhesion and proliferation on fe - alginate films with differing m / g ratios , using normal human dermal fibroblasts ( nhdf ) as model cells . we also focused on the degree of change in the condition of the fe - alginate gel during cell culture . here we report that favorable cell proliferation was observed on high - g , rather than on high - m fe - alginate gels , and that the stability of fe - alginate gel with firm cross - linkage between alginate and ferric ions seems to be a key supportive element for good cell proliferation . eagle 's minimum essential medium ( e - mem ) was obtained from nissui pharmaceutical ( tokyo , japan ) , fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) was from tissue culture biologicals ( tulare , ca , usa ) , and trypsin was from becton dickinson ( sparks , md , usa ) . anti - vitronectin polyclonal antibody was purchased from abd serotec ( oxford , uk ) . horseradish peroxidase ( hrp)-conjugated anti - rabbit igg was from santa cruz biotechnology ( santa cruz , ca , usa ) . all other chemicals were purchased from wako pure chemical co.

alginate influences its suitability as a culture substrate for encouraging good cell growth is of considerable significance . in this study , we observed that strong cross - linkage with ferric ions was necessary to ensure good cell proliferation during culture , and that alginate with a high g rather than a high m content showed better conservation of ferric ion cross - linkages . in the case of ca - alginate gels , it is reported that the m / g ratio influences cell compatibility . for instance , murine insulinoma cells encapsulated in high - m rather than high - g ca - alginate showed rapid growth and good metabolic activities . conversely , in the case of encapsulated neural stem cells , high - g ca - alginate microcapsules allowed better release of neurotrophic factor . studies of ca - alginate as a scaffold for cells have revealed that a high g content promptes good cell growth [ 14 , 15 ] . our present results demonstrated superior nhdf cell growth on high - g rather than high - m fe - alginate films ( figure 1 ) . additionally , we demonstrated that good cell growth occurred on high - m fe - alginate films under conditions that tended not to result in gel swelling and disintegration ( figure 5 ) . it is known that cells recognize proteins that are adsorbed onto the surfaces of substrate materials [ 1618 ] . in particular , vitronectin is a major factor that mediates initial adhesion of nhdf onto fe - alginate films in the presence of serum . in the present study , there was little difference in the ability to adsorb serum proteins , including vitronectin , between the two types of fe - alginate gel ( figure 3 ) . high -

the foveal thickness was 82 m [ fig . large atrophic holes were noticed at this time in the inferior retina and were delimited by laser photocoagulation [ fig . microperimetry , done with four - cross target because of poor fixation , reveals loss of perceived stimuli at the macula ( c ) . the macular hole is smaller and the detachment shallower after 3 days ( d and e ) . microperimetry shows absolute scotoma ( f ) seven days later , the macular hole is closed and the subretinal fluid nearly completely absorbed ( a and b ) . three weeks later , the chorioretinal scarring is very prominent ( d and e ) . two considerations relevant to the management of the present subject are , first , the mechanisms involved in the formation and closure of the traumatic mh and detachment , and second , whether a waiting period is advisable before undertaking any surgical repair . with respect to the first issue , the most important fact to understand is that the vitreous is very tightly', 'our case but we expect the proliferating potential of the recovering glial and rpe cells to be high in our patient , considering his young age , which eventually led to the closure of the mh . this mechanism is consistent with the histopathologic study of a surgically treated mh which was closed by bridging glial tissue . a quick recovery of the rpe function in young eyes also ensures the rapid absorption of the subretinal fluid . the resolution of the rd , simultaneous to the closure of the mh seems necessary for the successful resolution of both pathologies . we observed these processes occurring concurrently in our patient , leaving anatomically resolved rd and mh within 7 days of presentation . the time and need of surgical intervention is an open question with no available answer ; mhs and rds rarely arise simultaneously after trauma and therefore specific management guidelines are lacking . traumatic mhs are known to close spontaneously and a period of observation till 6 months has been advised before undertaking a surgical repair . chen et al . achieved retinal reattachment with the vitrectomy procedure and gas tamponade in seven patients out of eight who had traumatic mh - related rds . recently , spontaneous resolution of a traumatic mh - related macular detachment , which occurred within 3 weeks , has been described in a young patient . our patient experienced a complete closure of the mh and resolution of the macular detachment 1 week after the incident of trauma , young age and a relatively small size of the hole apparently being the factors responsible for a better anatomical outcome . however , functional visual improvement failed to occur despite anatomical reattachment of the retina because of irreversible changes at the macula . one must understand that functional and anatomical results may not correlate depending on the severity of the trauma ; the final va depends upon the degree of photoreceptor and rpe cell disruption . immediate visual loss after injury due to retinal dehiscence is followed by a delayed visual loss due to secondary changes in the retinochoroidal layer [ supplementary fig . besides this , our case illustrates that the spontaneous reattachment of a traumatic mh - related macular detachment is possible and a clear evidence of progressive clinical improvement entails a waiting period in the expectation of a spontaneous recovery', 'the mechanisms involved in the formation and closure of the traumatic mh and detachment , and second , whether a waiting period is advisable before undertaking any surgical repair . with respect to the first issue , the most important fact to understand is that the vitreous is very tightly adherent to the macula in young normal eyes , putting considerable stress upon this region when compression expansion of the globe occurs in a concussion injury . most eyes with a traumatic mh have an attached vitreous.[68 ] oct imaging corroborates this finding lending credence to the belief that the pathogenesis of mh is independent of the occurrence of a posterior vitreous detachment ( pvd ) and occurs likely as an immediate mechanical disruption in a coup contrecoup injury . delayed mh may however develop if pvd is incomplete , causing continued foveal traction , or due to contusion necrosis , or consequent to the formation and rupture of a foveal cyst.[57 ] a pvd was absent in our case and we believe that the hole occurred due to mechanical disruption as an immediate effect of concussion [ supplementary figs . 1 and 2 ] . a rd may occur due to the mechanical distortion that occurs between the retina and the vitreous ; loss of the retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) function and the hyperpermeability of retinal vessels consequent to the retinochoroidal concussion injury may be the important contributing factors . vertical scan through the macula on optical coherence tomography at presentation showing discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium and a full - thickness macular hole - associated retinal detachment horizontal scan through the macula on optical coherence tomography at presentation showing discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium and a full - thickness macular hole - associated retinal detachment the mechanisms responsible for the spontaneous closure of a traumatic mh include proliferating glial cells and rpe cells from the edges that fill the hole ; formation of an epiretinal membrane that constricts the hole ; and reattachment of the operculum to the mh . there was no operculum or membrane formation in our case but we expect the proliferating potential of the recovering glial and rpe cells to be high in our patient , considering his young age , which eventually led to the closure of the mh . this mechanism is consistent with the histopathologic study of a surgically treated mh', 'to secondary changes in the retinochoroidal layer [ supplementary fig . besides this , our case illustrates that the spontaneous reattachment of a traumatic mh - related macular detachment is possible and a clear evidence of progressive clinical improvement entails a waiting period in the expectation of a spontaneous recovery . fast macular thickness scan showed marked atrophy and thinning of the retina at the macula at 4 months following trauma', ""in the anterior chambers and posterior synechiae bilaterally ( fig . dilated fundus examination revealed vitreal cells and haze , which were present bilaterally , but more distinct in the left eye . 1c , d ) and peripheral retinal punched - out lesions were visible ( fig . intraocular pressure ( iop ) was 21 mm hg in the right eye and 30 mm hg in the left eye . the integration of the clinical signs at presentation led to a working diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis , possibly associated with anti - tnf treatment . angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) levels were mildly elevated ( 61 u / l , normal range 1051 u / l ) . physical examinations and chest x - rays were normal , and so was the pulmonary function test . the patient was also examined by an expert pulmonologist who ruled out any lung disease . she was treated with topical steroid drops as well as anti - glaucoma medication . by doing so , an improvement of the anterior uveitis and a normalization of the iop were achieved . in coordination with the rheumatologist , two months after the discontinuation of certolizumab , the uveitis had decreased and va had improved to 20/32 in both eyes . nevertheless , the macular edema persisted and the patient underwent periocular injections of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide ( triesence ;

What factors are responsible for the spontaneous closure of a traumatic macular hole?,"Proliferating glial cells and RPE cells from the edges that fill the hole, formation of an epiretinal membrane that constricts the hole, and reattachment of the operculum to the MH.","The factors responsible for the spontaneous closure of a traumatic macular hole include proliferating glial cells and RPE cells from the edges that fill the hole, formation of an epiretinal membrane that constricts the hole, and reattachment of the operculum to the macular hole. The proliferating potential of recovering glial and RPE cells is high in younger patients, which can eventually lead to the closure of the macular hole. This mechanism is consistent with histopathologic studies of surgically treated macular holes. Additionally, a quick recovery of RPE function in young eyes ensures rapid absorption of subretinal fluid, which is necessary for successful resolution of both macular hole and associated retinal detachment.","['the mechanisms involved in the formation and closure of the traumatic mh and detachment , and second , whether a waiting period is advisable before undertaking any surgical repair . with respect to the first issue , the most important fact to understand is that the vitreous is very tightly adherent to the macula in young normal eyes , putting considerable stress upon this region when compression expansion of the globe occurs in a concussion injury . most eyes with a traumatic mh have an attached vitreous.[68 ] oct imaging corroborates this finding lending credence to the belief that the pathogenesis of mh is independent of the occurrence of a posterior vitreous detachment ( pvd ) and occurs likely as an immediate mechanical disruption in a coup contrecoup injury . delayed mh may however develop if pvd is incomplete , causing continued foveal traction , or due to contusion necrosis , or consequent to the formation and rupture of a foveal cyst.[57 ] a pvd was absent in our case and we believe that the hole occurred due to mechanical disruption as an immediate effect of concussion [ supplementary figs . 1 and 2 ] . a rd may occur due to the mechanical distortion that occurs between the retina and the vitreous ;

liu , chen , et al 2006 ) . qds have been reported to be an excellent quantum particle for use in biological systems based on very high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies , and the ability to cover the whole visible spectral range depending on particle size ( liu , chen , et al 2006 ) . thus , two different sized cdte qds with emission peaks at 585 nm and 540 nm were prepared ( figure 1 ) and used in the preparation of bioconjugated nanoparticles ( nps ) for detection of rsv infection . these particles were prepared for bioconjugation as previously described ( wang et al 2002 ) , and conjugated to monoclonal antibodies reactive to rsv f protein , clone 131 - 2a . briefly , thioglycolate ( tga)-coated cdte particles were mixed 1:1 with rsv anti - f protein monoclonal antibody ( 4 mg / ml ) and the solution was stabilized with 10x phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) , ph 7.2 to a final 1 x pbs concentration . edc / nhs ( 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hcl / n - hydroxysulfosuccinimide ) was added to bring to qd solution to a final concentration of 50 mm/5 mm , respectively . the reaction was incubated for 2 h at room temperature , then overnight at 4 c . precipitated bioconjugated np aggregates were separated by centrifugation to remove unwanted aggregates from single , bioconjugated nanoparticles . the final concentration of the purified np - antibody conjugate stock solution was 0.625 mm . vero cells ( african green monkey kidney cells ) were grown in dulbecco s modified eagle s media ( dmem ) containing 10% fetal bovine sera ( dmem-10% ) . for some experiments involving nps , vero cells were propagated on lab - tek chamber slides to 80%90% confluency using dmem-10% . respiratory syncytial virus strain a2 ( rsv ) rsv was diluted in dmem and the cells infected at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 1 . the', 'semiconductor quantum dots are excellent fluorescent nanoprobes for biological and biomedical applications because of their unique size - dependent optical and electronic properties ( penn et al 2003 ; alivisatos these nanoparticles ( nps ) possess unique optical properties in comparison with traditional organic dyes including size- and composition - tunable emission , narrow emission spectra , and excellent photostability ( hotz 2005 ) . recent improvements in surface chemistry have augmented the ability to make functionalized nps to create bioconjugated nps that allow for specific targeting or signal enhancement ( farokhzad et al 2006 ; fujiwara et al 2006 ; goodman et al 2006 ; ipe et al 2006 ; suk et al 2006 ) . bioconjugated nps , coupled with spectroscopy or other spectral imaging tools , eg , flow cytometry and histological techniques , provides a novel and powerful platform for mapping the molecular and disease profiles associated with infection by different pathogens ( zhao et al 2004 ; driskell et al 2005 ; yao et al 2006 ; mcveigh 2006 ) . another advantage of bioconjugated nps over conventional pathogen detection methods is that the nps may be conjugated with many biomolecules thereby enhancing the signal and the binding avidity by mitigating a multivalency effect . this is particularly important for targeting nps and for increasing the delivery or efficacy of bioconjugated molecules . however , only limited reports are available which address the utility of nps for detection or diagnosis virus infection ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ; bentzen et al 2005 ; driskell et al 2005 ; li , cu , et al 2005 ; li , liu , et al 2005 ; wabuyele and vo - dinh 2005 ; wan et al 2005 ; fuentes et al 2006 ; liu , cao , et al 2006 ; souza et al 2006 ) . respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a single - stranded negative sense rna virus in the paramyxoviridae family that is the primary cause of morbidity and life - threatening lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide , as well as an important pathogen of the elderly and immune compromised ( bader and mckinsey 2005 ; ebbert and limper 2005 ; mejias et al 2005 ) the disease burden associated with rsv infection is considerable as rsv is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants', 'antigens , as well as for targeting sites of virus infection with antiviral agents that may be linked to the nps . indeed , bioconjugated nps have been used to identify the presence and progression of rsv infection in a human epithelial cell line , ie , hep-2 cells ( bentzen et al 2005 ) , as well as used in a variety of intracellular tracking and related studies ( alivisatos et al 2005 ; bruchez 2005 ; gao et al 2005 ; hotz 2005 ; shenoy et al 2006 ; mcveigh 2006 ) . importantly , we show here that rsv - nps can be applied as tools to enhance virus detection by increasing sensitivity of virus detection while decreasing the detection time . application of rsv - nps for virus detection in animal models can provide a path to assist our ability to dissect important parameters of rsv disease pathogenesis such as determining sites of virus infection and virus load in the lungs of infected animals .', 'plus enzyme substrate , to that of a single - step detection method using rsv - nps . conventional antibody staining methods produced substantial background staining in mock - infected vero cells ( figure 2a ) , however did detect rsv plaque formation in the vero cell lawn ( figure 2b ) . in contrast , rsv - nps used in a single - step method produced little background ( figure 2c ) , and readily detected rsv plaques ( figure 2d ) . these results show that rsv - nps can be used to detect rsv in a single - step fashion , and that this method can be used to greatly reduce the amount of time and reagent needed for rsv detection compared to conventional immunostaining procedures ( tripp et al 1999 ) . extending the in vitro detection findings ( figure 2 ) , we determined if rsv - nps could be used to quantitate rsv titers in a single step fashion , thereby shortening the detection time needed to quantitate virus titers by plaque assay ( figure 3 ) . in these studies , we compared a conventional immunostaining plaque assay which requires 5 or 6 days of in vitro culture post - rsv infection ( tripp et al 1999 ) to rapid single - step detection by rsv - nps . for comparison of the different plaque assay methods , virus titers were assessed at days 2 , 3 , 5 , or 6 pi . the results showed that at days 5 or 6 pi , conventional immunostaining ( figure 3a ) and the single - step rsv - np detection method ( figure 3b ) were similarly sensitive for detecting rsv plaques in the vero cell lawn . however , rsv - nps could detect rsv plaques earlier ( days 2 or 3 pi ) compared with conventional immunostaining which was comparatively ineffective ( figure 4 ) , indicating that the single - step rsv - nps procedure was more sensitive at detecting limiting levels of rsv . this result is not unexpected given the multivalent properties of rsv - nps . to evaluate the efficacy of rsv - nps to detect rsv infection in vivo , balb / c were either intranasally infected with 10 pfu rsv or mock - treated , and at day 4 pi , rsv - infected or', 'children worldwide , as well as an important pathogen of the elderly and immune compromised ( bader and mckinsey 2005 ; ebbert and limper 2005 ; mejias et al 2005 ) the disease burden associated with rsv infection is considerable as rsv is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide having infection rates approaching 70%80% in the first year of life with many patients requiring hospitalization ( mccarthy and hall 2003 ; leung et al 2005 ) . unfortunately , despite five decades of research , no safe and effective rsv vaccine is available and few effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments are available . thus , there is a critical need for the development of novel tools and platforms to augment virus diagnosis and foundational studies required for development of disease intervention strategies . the surface topography of viruses lends to detection by antibodies , a feature that has been successfully used for bio - conjuagted np detection of rsv ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ; bentzen et al 2005 ) . rsv has two major surface proteins , ie , g and f proteins , that are primarily responsible for virus attachment and fusion , respectively ( tripp 2005 ) . both g and f proteins are recognized by the immune system as neutralizing antigens ; thus a majority of antibodies are directed toward these proteins ( tripp 2005 ) . the rsv f protein is more conserved than the g protein among rsv strains ( tripp 2005 ) , thus antibodies reactive to the f protein are ideal target developing bioconjugated nanoparticles . taking advantage of the composition - tunable emission of nps and their multivalent specificity when conjugated to monoclonal antibodies , we tested the ability of these bioconjugated nps to detect rsv infection in vitro and in vivo using in a single - step format . we show that bioconjugated nps can be used to rapidly and sensitively detect rsv infection in both cell lines and mice , and that the detection can be done in a single step format . this single - step format dramatically improves virus detection time , potentially saves costs , and reduces background staining that is currently associated with conventional virus detection methods . to develop bioconjugated nanoparticles to detect rsv infection , semiconductor cadmium telluride ( cdte ) quantum dots ( qds )']"

What was the aim of the transcultural research on mood disorders mentioned in the paper?,"The aim was to produce a hypothesis that unifies the various manifestations of discomfort, particularly through mood symptoms, and to examine if behaviors considered pathological in one context may be adaptive in another, potentially leading to social change.","The aim of the transcultural research on mood disorders mentioned in the paper was to produce a hypothesis that brings together the different ways discomfort manifests itself, with a focus on discomfort viewed through mood symptoms.

esteem , feelings of guilt and helplessness supposedly arose "" epidemically "" in a specific area of 17th - century england . the phenomenon was already known at the time and was defined as the "" english malady "" . prior to that time the ( rare ) descriptions of depression had concentrated on a psychosomatic symptomatology and in particular on symptoms of tiredness and loss of hope . the changes in symptoms coincided with a period of profound social upheaval : the geographical area was that in which the first historical form of industrialization was taking place in textile manufacturing . the social change supposedly took place on two interacting levels . firstly , the rhythms of industrial work marked the end of the extended family typical of', 'population sample in the united states ( of what first evaluation in 1992 and repeated in 2002 ) , and the australian study in new south wales ( first evaluation in 1998 and repeated in 2008 ) , appear undoubtedly to confirm the hypothesis of an increase in the prevalence and incidence of depression at least in the last few decades . sardinians , apparently , go in the opposite direction : this emerges from the data of our latest study performed in a sardinian mining district with three estimates of the frequency of depression in the overall population in 1988 , 1998 and 2008 . the pervasiveness of depression clearly appears to be decreasing in the last twenty years and , at least in the last ten years , the comparison with the first investigation needs to be considered with more caution in the light of the different interviewing method used and the fact that the diagnostic system had changed . in the ten years preceding the first study the area had seen a 50% decrease in the population in forty years . we have asked ourselves whether this decrease against the general trend has been caused by selective migration , that is , the departure of persons who were in some way "" vulnerable "" to depression . a certain popular literature has underscored that migration may select persons with "" hypomanic temperaments "" . gartner , in his book the link between ( a little ) craziness and ( a lot of ) success in america advances the hypothesis that success in america is due to immigrants who are more ambitious , determined , creative and resistant to frustration than others . the author , a psychiatrist well - known to the media , argues that emigrants are more frequently persons with hypomanic traits . this is an apparently "" naive "" theory , but one that may confirm what we stated as concerns the results in the mining district . we must in fact consider that persons with a hypo - manic temperament are more exposed than others to depressive episodes . i defined gartner \'s theory as naive because we can not argue that all emigrants leave for similar reasons and with the same determination to accept a challenge . it is sufficient to consider refugees who are forced to abandon their homes rather than', 'presents adaptive advantages in particular contexts of tumultuous changes , such as those that occur in an unfamiliar world in a couple of migrants , as has been described in studies on sardinians . it is reasonable to expect that different social conditions are capable of triggering specific vulnerabilities in the two sexes and that the interaction between environment and hormonal structure may produce the different psychopathological expression . the socioeconomic context found in paris in our investigation recalls scenarios common to europe in the last forty years . the "" argentine model "" appears to reflect that of europe in the next ten years . there will be a new change in the phenomenology of mood disorders in the future ?', '. on the plateau they either did not exist or were not considered as falling within the scope of the system of treatment . laboriously , and with the help of many linguists , we translated some of the epidemiological instruments used in europe in epidemiological investigations of mental health . we then performed a study to verify the presence of depression on the dogon plateau . it was a study conducted using western nosological criteria but with the intention of comparing them to the interpretive modalities of the culture under examination , studied according to the approach that anthropologists and new transcultural psychiatrists would define as dialectic between "" etic "" and "" emic "" . the population studied lived in a very poor sahelian area in nomadic camps ( the peuls ) or villages ( the dogons ) with no electricity , organized transport or communications systems . thus we are dealing with a study of extreme interest owing to its singularity , albeit next to impossible to replicate . numerous observations in western africa appear , in faft , to indicate a progressive change , today , in psychopathology , especially in circles that are urban and literate in the western sense [ 22 , 23 ] . the prevalence of depressive disorders found the dogon plateau was lower than what have found in studies performed in europe with similar instruments or in africa in urban contexts or in conditions of war [ 24 , 25 ] . among the illiterates , who were a consistent part of the cohort , most depressed individuals also suffered from somatic disorders that had begun prior to the onset of the psychiatric disorder . the study showed the importance of somatic diseases as a risk factor for depression when the reproductive role ( as in the case of parasitic infections of the genitourinary tract ) or the social or family role ( as in the case of heart diseases and tuberculosis ) have been affected . thus , in the societies studied , we may find a behavioural pattern similar , but not identical , to our depressive patterns . but this is rare , probably because its onset requires a triggering condition of higher impact . moreover , in agreement with what has been demonstrated by other studies , depression is not considered a disease and thus does not', ', but not identical , to our depressive patterns . but this is rare , probably because its onset requires a triggering condition of higher impact . moreover , in agreement with what has been demonstrated by other studies , depression is not considered a disease and thus does not fall within conventional or traditional treatment systems . a later work aimed at characterizing the syndromic aggregations by means of a sophisticated statistical method based on how a symptom is more likely to occur associated with one or more symptoms . the results suggest a non - superimposition of the depressive phenomenology most frequently found on the dogon plateau on the psychological profiles usually found in western contexts . it also appears to confirm the existence of two opposing ways of expressing the discomfort which are most likely "" culturally determined "" . one way is more frequent and characterized by psychoastenic symptoms with persecutory overtones , while the other , similar to depression as we in industrialized countries know it , is found in literate persons . the bandiagara study suggests that social factors influence the manifestation of the melancholy phenomenology and perhaps they may affect the risk of becoming depressed , but it does not allow us to formulate any hypothesis explaining how this may come about . some elements of interest on this subject are presented in the results of an investigation carried out in the namwera area in malawi , bordering on mozambique . in this region , inhabited by yao and chicewa peoples , the economy was prevalently based on farming and only at the time of the study had other occupations emerged . malawi was in fact the only african country that had maintained a strongly traditional political structure up to the 1990s ; urbanization had been opposed by the central government , which had officially acknowledged the village chief as its representative . it is one of the poorest countries in the world with the highest rate of hiv infections . however , at the time of the study , malawi had undergone profound transformations involving micro- and macrosocial aspects and which , in the following years , had led to the setting up of a democracy with different political parties determined by a referendum . in a world that had not changed for centuries , these changes had a strong emotive impact']"

pico della mirandola , oratio de hominis dignitate , in cassirer 1974 ) but it developed as this new interpretation of reality , this new way of perceiving the world and one \'s active and important role led the development of the middle class concept of moral responsibility . this prospect negated the idea that providence was the cause and driving force of events and saw individuals as the prime arbiters of their own destinies . since the reaching of one \'s goals was to be considered the result of individual efforts , consequently defeats and failures were the result of an individual s ineptitude . divine indulgence , according to the new protestant ethic , which took hold with the changing economy , was the reward for the hard work of the good christian . many studies were carried out in the 1950s and 60s on depression in areas of sub - saharan africa in which cultural contacts with western societies had been limited . thus in this context depression could not be considered a "" western "" disorder . according to henry collomb , who had transformed the fann psychiatric hospital in dakar into a sort of therapeutic village , depression was to be considered the most significant element in african psychopathology , although clinically the disorder was characterized by ideas of reference , persecutory delusions and psychosomatic symptoms . the ideas of guilt , self -', 'presents adaptive advantages in particular contexts of tumultuous changes , such as those that occur in an unfamiliar world in a couple of migrants , as has been described in studies on sardinians . it is reasonable to expect that different social conditions are capable of triggering specific vulnerabilities in the two sexes and that the interaction between environment and hormonal structure may produce the different psychopathological expression . the socioeconomic context found in paris in our investigation recalls scenarios common to europe in the last forty years . the "" argentine model "" appears to reflect that of europe in the next ten years . there will be a new change in the phenomenology of mood disorders in the future ?', ', but not identical , to our depressive patterns . but this is rare , probably because its onset requires a triggering condition of higher impact . moreover , in agreement with what has been demonstrated by other studies , depression is not considered a disease and thus does not fall within conventional or traditional treatment systems . a later work aimed at characterizing the syndromic aggregations by means of a sophisticated statistical method based on how a symptom is more likely to occur associated with one or more symptoms . the results suggest a non - superimposition of the depressive phenomenology most frequently found on the dogon plateau on the psychological profiles usually found in western contexts . it also appears to confirm the existence of two opposing ways of expressing the discomfort which are most likely "" culturally determined "" . one way is more frequent and characterized by psychoastenic symptoms with persecutory overtones , while the other , similar to depression as we in industrialized countries know it , is found in literate persons . the bandiagara study suggests that social factors influence the manifestation of the melancholy phenomenology and perhaps they may affect the risk of becoming depressed , but it does not allow us to formulate any hypothesis explaining how this may come about . some elements of interest on this subject are presented in the results of an investigation carried out in the namwera area in malawi , bordering on mozambique . in this region , inhabited by yao and chicewa peoples , the economy was prevalently based on farming and only at the time of the study had other occupations emerged . malawi was in fact the only african country that had maintained a strongly traditional political structure up to the 1990s ; urbanization had been opposed by the central government , which had officially acknowledged the village chief as its representative . it is one of the poorest countries in the world with the highest rate of hiv infections . however , at the time of the study , malawi had undergone profound transformations involving micro- and macrosocial aspects and which , in the following years , had led to the setting up of a democracy with different political parties determined by a referendum . in a world that had not changed for centuries , these changes had a strong emotive impact', 'thus offer opportunities for success of individuals who are "" desperate , explorative and super - responsible "" ( with "" compulsive hyper - responsibilization "" in bowlbian terms ) while in other circumstances "" unperturbed "" by the change , they would probably be destined to undergo social humiliation . the social change from an evolutionary standpoint may also form the substrate that favours , selects and amplifies the frequency of behaviour of this kind . at the same time , this exposes to decompensation : the step may be rewarded , but those who take it are more at risk : they are alone on a new road and do not have the support of the group , which no longer recognizes them and tends to isolate them . the model may explain not only the transformation of the symptoms ( centred on responsibility and guilt ) but also the supposed increase in depression in western society . the supposed increase in depression in western societies can not in fact be explained by "" ingenuous "" biological and genetic hypotheses : it is irrational if not interpreted from a complex socio - biological standpoint . if depression were simply caused by genetic vulnerability we could not explain why a condition that afflicts persons who live shorter lives and give birth to fewer children does not disappear , but according to some has seen a continuous increase from the 17th century to the present . some studies appear to demonstrate it : the swedish study repeated over time by lundby ;

"According to the research findings, why might the prevalence of depression in western societies not be fully explained by biological and genetic factors?","The prevalence of depression in western societies cannot be fully explained by biological and genetic factors alone because it does not account for why a condition that shortens lives and reduces reproductive success has not disappeared. Instead, the increase in depression must be considered from a complex socio-biological perspective, taking into account that certain forms may have an adaptive advantage in specific conditions of social change.","The research findings suggest that the prevalence of depression in western societies cannot be fully explained by biological and genetic factors. This is because depression has been found to be influenced by complex socio-biological factors and social changes. The increase in depression in western societies over time cannot be solely attributed to genetic vulnerability, as depression is not a disease that disappears despite afflicting individuals who live shorter lives and have fewer children. The findings indicate that social factors and cultural determinants may play a significant role in the manifestation and risk of becoming depressed. Therefore, the prevalence of depression in western societies is likely influenced by a combination of genetic vulnerability, socio-biological factors, and social changes rather than solely biological and genetic factors.","['thus offer opportunities for success of individuals who are "" desperate , explorative and super - responsible "" ( with "" compulsive hyper - responsibilization "" in bowlbian terms ) while in other circumstances "" unperturbed "" by the change , they would probably be destined to undergo social humiliation . the social change from an evolutionary standpoint may also form the substrate that favours , selects and amplifies the frequency of behaviour of this kind . at the same time , this exposes to decompensation : the step may be rewarded , but those who take it are more at risk : they are alone on a new road and do not have the support of the group , which no longer recognizes them and tends to isolate them . the model may explain not only the transformation of the symptoms ( centred on responsibility and guilt ) but also the supposed increase in depression in western society . the supposed increase in depression in western societies can not in fact be explained by "" ingenuous "" biological and genetic hypotheses : it is irrational if not interpreted from a complex socio - biological standpoint . if depression were simply caused by genetic vulnerability we could not explain why a condition that afflicts persons who live shorter lives and give birth to fewer children does not disappear , but according to some has seen a continuous increase from the 17th century to the present . some studies appear to demonstrate it : the swedish study repeated over time by lundby ; the analysis of data of the national study in the united states conducted in the 1980s which , however , is a cross -

manic temperament are more exposed than others to depressive episodes . i defined gartner \'s theory as naive because we can not argue that all emigrants leave for similar reasons and with the same determination to accept a challenge . it is sufficient to consider refugees who are forced to abandon their homes rather than', '. on the plateau they either did not exist or were not considered as falling within the scope of the system of treatment . laboriously , and with the help of many linguists , we translated some of the epidemiological instruments used in europe in epidemiological investigations of mental health . we then performed a study to verify the presence of depression on the dogon plateau . it was a study conducted using western nosological criteria but with the intention of comparing them to the interpretive modalities of the culture under examination , studied according to the approach that anthropologists and new transcultural psychiatrists would define as dialectic between "" etic "" and "" emic "" . the population studied lived in a very poor sahelian area in nomadic camps ( the peuls ) or villages ( the dogons ) with no electricity , organized transport or communications systems . thus we are dealing with a study of extreme interest owing to its singularity , albeit next to impossible to replicate . numerous observations in western africa appear , in faft , to indicate a progressive change , today , in psychopathology , especially in circles that are urban and literate in the western sense [ 22 , 23 ] . the prevalence of depressive disorders found the dogon plateau was lower than what have found in studies performed in europe with similar instruments or in africa in urban contexts or in conditions of war [ 24 , 25 ] . among the illiterates , who were a consistent part of the cohort , most depressed individuals also suffered from somatic disorders that had begun prior to the onset of the psychiatric disorder . the study showed the importance of somatic diseases as a risk factor for depression when the reproductive role ( as in the case of parasitic infections of the genitourinary tract ) or the social or family role ( as in the case of heart diseases and tuberculosis ) have been affected . thus , in the societies studied , we may find a behavioural pattern similar , but not identical , to our depressive patterns . but this is rare , probably because its onset requires a triggering condition of higher impact . moreover , in agreement with what has been demonstrated by other studies , depression is not considered a disease and thus does not', 'this paper is the report on and balance of some thirty years of transcultural research on mood disorders . the aim of our work was to produce a hypothesis bringing together the different ways in which discomfort manifests itself , with special emphasis on discomfort viewed through mood symptoms . our goal was to see if behaviours defined as pathological and which produced maladjustment in the patient in determined contexts may produce adaptive effects in different contexts and , thanks to attenuated expressions , find in these circumstances the conditions for replication and thus become factors leading to social change . we searched for an interpretation of interactions between environment and behaviours , not from a simplistic perspective that interprets the modalities through which discomfort is expressed as the product of a culture , but by applying an evolutionary approach to see if certain behaviour patterns can be selected from the changing context ( since a static context would not modify the social significance of such patterns ) and finally to see if the very same behaviours can contribute to influencing the environment . in the case of mood disorders , this amounts to seeing how specific milieus can be adaptive for persons with temperaments or "" subthreshold "" depressive and/or expansive hyperergic symptoms . our investigation started from h. b. murphy \'s hypothesis . in the 1970s he performed an historical analysis of the descriptions of depression found in europe , collecting mostly the contributions of physicians and members of the clergy over a period of some centuries . according to murphy , the symptomatology characterized by low self - esteem , feelings of guilt and helplessness supposedly arose "" epidemically "" in a specific area of 17th - century england . the phenomenon was already known at the time and was defined as the "" english malady "" . prior to that time the ( rare ) descriptions of depression had concentrated on a psychosomatic symptomatology and in particular on symptoms of tiredness and loss of hope . the changes in symptoms coincided with a period of profound social upheaval : the geographical area was that in which the first historical form of industrialization was taking place in textile manufacturing . the social change supposedly took place on two interacting levels . firstly , the rhythms of industrial work marked the end of the extended family typical of']"

based image analysis tool that enabled us to acquire objective semi - quantitative scores of cd20 expression levels based on intensity and completeness of cd20-immunostaining of the ffpet sections . as indicated by the previous investigations using fcm analysis of fresh tissue samples , the levels of cd20 expression assessed by semi - quantitative immunohistochemistry were quite heterogeneous among the patients , with scores spread over a wide and linear range . by correlating the expression level of cd20 with the clinical outcomes , we were able to identify a subgroup of dlbcl patients with cd20 expression levels below the cut - off score , who showed poor efs and os independent of other known clinical and pathologic parameters . further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic role of the relative abundance of cd20 expression in a larger cohort . interestingly , shimizu et al . recently reported that histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitors augment cytotoxic effect of rituximab by increasing the level of cd20 in the cell lines of dlbcl . accordingly , the patients with lower levels of cd20 expression who could be less amenable to rituximab therapy could probably benefit from pretreatment of hdac inhibitors such as valproic acid prior to the standard r - chop treatment . alternatively , they could more likely benefit from the treatment with novel anti - cd20 monoclonal antibodies which show more anti - cancer activity in cd20 low - expression b - cell lymphomas . for example , ofatumumab ( a fully human anti - cd20 monoclonal antibody ) and obinutuzumab ( a humanized type ii antibody targeted against cd20 ) have been shown to be active and safe in clinical trials that had included patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia which is known to have relatively lower levels of cd20 expression . in conclusion , a level of cd20 expression is heterogeneous in dlbcl and lower level of cd20 expression is a poor prognostic marker for survival in patients with dlbcl who are treated with r - chop chemotherapy . semi - quantitative immunohistochemical estimation of cd20 expression can be used to identify a subgroup of dlbcl patients', ""in the anterior chambers and posterior synechiae bilaterally ( fig . dilated fundus examination revealed vitreal cells and haze , which were present bilaterally , but more distinct in the left eye . 1c , d ) and peripheral retinal punched -

nmda receptor encephalitis in 2005 and suggested that it was an acute , female - predominant ( 81% ) autoimmune encephalitis.1,2 about half of the patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis had underlying neoplasms , with ovarian teratomas ( 94% ) being the most common.13 a recent large cohort study demonstrated that milder severity of symptoms , no need for intensive care , early immunotherapy , and prompt tumor removal were good prognostic factors.3 half of the patients had improvement in symptoms within 4 weeks after early immunotherapy . in another case report , the authors noted that steroid usage 3 months after onset of symptoms also resulted in significant improvements.3,5 the recovery phase might last for 18 months or longer.34 to maximize a patient s functional outcome , clinical practitioners need to be aware of this potentially curable disease and its common sequelae in order to organize rational , individualized rehabilitation programs.6,7 we report the long - term course of a young pediatric patient with recalcitrant anti - nmda receptor encephalitis and prolonged length of stay in hospital for 7 months . a young girl aged 3 years 2 months and without known medical or psychiatric history was admitted to our hospital due to personality changes that had persisted for 2 weeks . her condition progressed over the course of 12 days to behavioral regression , unsteady gait , headache , irritable crying , catatonia - like response , generalized choreoathetoid movements , orofacial dyskinesia , and collapsed lung , in successive order . as a result , she was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit . her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white - matter lesions over bilateral frontal lobes ( figure 1 ) . a complete etiologic', 'nmda receptor encephalitis , the iq test showed no significant change except for performance iq improvement from 58 to 64 . she still had residual sequelae of mild mental retardation , and she had a mildly impulsive personality and was easily distracted . the typical presentations of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis could be divided into eight categories in decreasing order of prevalence , including acute behavioral or cognitive change , movement disorder , memory deficit , speech disorder , seizure , decreased level of consciousness , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation . in an observational cohort study , about 87% of patients shared similar symptoms that included four or more of the eight categories within the first 4 weeks.3 definite diagnosis for this disease was the presence of nmda receptor antibodies in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid ( 100% sensitivity ) or serum ( 85% sensitivity).2,3 reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid antibodies appeared to be correlated to a better clinical outcome.2,8 there were no correlations between different domains of symptoms , extent of disease progression , and brain mri findings , with only 33%50% of patients showing nonspecific abnormalities on standard mri.2,3 one recent functional mri study proposed that reduced functional connectivity between bilateral hippocampus may predict memory performance , and that extensive white - matter changes in diffusion tensor imaging might correlate to the disease severity.9 the acronym nmdar is useful as a mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis : n for nonspecific prodrome , r for respiration depression . early detection of this disease and confirmed diagnosis with nmda receptor antibodies ensures early intervention and better recovery . the recommended first - line immunotherapies were corticosteroid , intravenous immunoglobulin , and plasmaphoresis . about 60% of patients achieved good outcomes with minor functional deficits remaining after first - line therapy or tumor removal.3 the second - line immunotherapies , which include rituximab and cyclophosphamide , were recommended to be started if patients failed to respond to first - line therapies after no more than 4 weeks,2,3 and resulted in a response rate of approximately 78%.3 full recovery and fewer neurological relapses were more frequently seen in patients with teratoma that had been removed.2,3,10 the general relapsing rate was 12%24% within the first 2 years , and overall mortality rate was 4%9.5%.2,3 a search of relevant articles was conducted on pubmed (', 'rate of approximately 78%.3 full recovery and fewer neurological relapses were more frequently seen in patients with teratoma that had been removed.2,3,10 the general relapsing rate was 12%24% within the first 2 years , and overall mortality rate was 4%9.5%.2,3 a search of relevant articles was conducted on pubmed ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) , medline ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) and embase ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) , using anti - nmda receptor encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis as search terms . in the current literature , the age of onset for anti - nmda receptor encephalitis ranged from 8 months to 85 years.3,11 adult patients more often presented with memory deficits , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation . in contrast , children younger than 12 years of age generally presented with behavioral or cognitive changes , involuntary movements , speech disorders , ataxia , and hemiparesis.3 consistent with recent literature for young patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis , we did not identify any underlying tumor for our patient . these symptoms even persisted an additional 6 weeks after the start of second - line immunotherapy . the severity and duration of the movement disorders might be a reflection of the encephalitis severity.3,6 it could be worthwhile to arrange a comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation program for ill children who do not fit the good - outcome predictors , because their prognosis might still be favorable , such as the case we have reported . the ideal treatment goals for patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis are to accomplish stable medical condition , attain functional goals , and achieve good family training.6 the children in several studies had multiple impairments at the time of hospital discharge , especially deficits in delicate motor skills and cognition , and were deemed as needing further outpatient rehabilitation.6,7,12 goal - oriented training based on a multidisciplinary approach and individualized programs in physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training provided better functional outcomes and might shorten the rehabilitation time course.6,7 in the current case , physical performance , nonverbal reasoning , and fluid intelligence were often impaired but all of them had fair to good response to training . on the contrary , problems such as the patient s short attention span were frustrating . because cognitive recovery was significantly impaired despite recovery in', ', physical performance , nonverbal reasoning , and fluid intelligence were often impaired but all of them had fair to good response to training . on the contrary , problems such as the patient s short attention span were frustrating . because cognitive recovery was significantly impaired despite recovery in other neurological deficits , compensating cognitive deficits might be a core concept for late - phase rehabilitation.6 family education about rational goals and the importance of strictly carrying out cognitive - behavioral therapy at home might also be helpful . moreover , an individualized education program to address a child s distraction , delayed information interpretation speed , and learning difficulty is also suggested to be executed in school.6 most articles about anti - nmda receptor encephalitis in the literature described the presentation of symptoms , diagnostic process , follow - up antibody titers , and neurological status . however , none of them described long - term rehabilitation strategies for these patients ; only two articles described inpatient rehabilitation programs in seven patients.6,7 our report highlights the sequential functional changes experienced by the young patient during the 28 months of rehabilitation ( both inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation ) , and pointed out the possible challenges during the rehabilitative programs . even so , the interventions and therapies described here may not be useful for all patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis . in cases of encephalitis of unknown cause and with characteristic symptoms , treatable anti - nmda receptor encephalitis should be taken into consideration and further intervention must be performed as early as possible . comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs , including physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training , are usually necessary for these patients and , generally , a good outcome can be expected .', 'was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit . her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white -

nmda receptor encephalitis . in cases of encephalitis of unknown cause and with characteristic symptoms , treatable anti - nmda receptor encephalitis should be taken into consideration and further intervention must be performed as early as possible . comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs , including physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training , are usually necessary for these patients and , generally , a good outcome can be expected .', 'nmda receptor encephalitis , the iq test showed no significant change except for performance iq improvement from 58 to 64 . she still had residual sequelae of mild mental retardation , and she had a mildly impulsive personality and was easily distracted . the typical presentations of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis could be divided into eight categories in decreasing order of prevalence , including acute behavioral or cognitive change , movement disorder , memory deficit , speech disorder , seizure , decreased level of consciousness , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation . in an observational cohort study , about 87% of patients shared similar symptoms that included four or more of the eight categories within the first 4 weeks.3 definite diagnosis for this disease was the presence of nmda receptor antibodies in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid ( 100% sensitivity ) or serum ( 85% sensitivity).2,3 reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid antibodies appeared to be correlated to a better clinical outcome.2,8 there were no correlations between different domains of symptoms , extent of disease progression , and brain mri findings , with only 33%50% of patients showing nonspecific abnormalities on standard mri.2,3 one recent functional mri study proposed that reduced functional connectivity between bilateral hippocampus may predict memory performance , and that extensive white - matter changes in diffusion tensor imaging might correlate to the disease severity.9 the acronym nmdar is useful as a mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of anti - nmda receptor encephalitis : n for nonspecific prodrome , r for respiration depression . early detection of this disease and confirmed diagnosis with nmda receptor antibodies ensures early intervention and better recovery . the recommended first - line immunotherapies were corticosteroid , intravenous immunoglobulin , and plasmaphoresis . about 60% of patients achieved good outcomes with minor functional deficits remaining after first - line therapy or tumor removal.3 the second - line immunotherapies , which include rituximab and cyclophosphamide , were recommended to be started if patients failed to respond to first - line therapies after no more than 4 weeks,2,3 and resulted in a response rate of approximately 78%.3 full recovery and fewer neurological relapses were more frequently seen in patients with teratoma that had been removed.2,3,10 the general relapsing rate was 12%24% within the first 2 years , and overall mortality rate was 4%9.5%.2,3 a search of relevant articles was conducted on pubmed (', 'rate of approximately 78%.3 full recovery and fewer neurological relapses were more frequently seen in patients with teratoma that had been removed.2,3,10 the general relapsing rate was 12%24% within the first 2 years , and overall mortality rate was 4%9.5%.2,3 a search of relevant articles was conducted on pubmed ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) , medline ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) and embase ( from 2000 to august 2014 ) , using anti - nmda receptor encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis as search terms . in the current literature , the age of onset for anti - nmda receptor encephalitis ranged from 8 months to 85 years.3,11 adult patients more often presented with memory deficits , autonomic dysfunction , and central hypoventilation . in contrast , children younger than 12 years of age generally presented with behavioral or cognitive changes , involuntary movements , speech disorders , ataxia , and hemiparesis.3 consistent with recent literature for young patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis , we did not identify any underlying tumor for our patient . these symptoms even persisted an additional 6 weeks after the start of second - line immunotherapy . the severity and duration of the movement disorders might be a reflection of the encephalitis severity.3,6 it could be worthwhile to arrange a comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation program for ill children who do not fit the good - outcome predictors , because their prognosis might still be favorable , such as the case we have reported . the ideal treatment goals for patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis are to accomplish stable medical condition , attain functional goals , and achieve good family training.6 the children in several studies had multiple impairments at the time of hospital discharge , especially deficits in delicate motor skills and cognition , and were deemed as needing further outpatient rehabilitation.6,7,12 goal - oriented training based on a multidisciplinary approach and individualized programs in physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training provided better functional outcomes and might shorten the rehabilitation time course.6,7 in the current case , physical performance , nonverbal reasoning , and fluid intelligence were often impaired but all of them had fair to good response to training . on the contrary , problems such as the patient s short attention span were frustrating . because cognitive recovery was significantly impaired despite recovery in', 'anti - n - methyl - d - aspartate ( anti - nmda ) receptor encephalitis is an acute , immune - mediated paraneoplastic syndrome with a characteristic sequential clinical course . it includes a prodrome of flu - like illness progressing to behavior changes , psychosis , and memory deficit . dyskinesia , seizure attacks , deteriorated consciousness level , and autonomic instability may be seen in later stages.14 patients may gradually recover , with these symptoms resolving in reverse order.14 dalmau s group first described anti - nmda receptor encephalitis in 2005 and suggested that it was an acute , female - predominant ( 81% ) autoimmune encephalitis.1,2 about half of the patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis had underlying neoplasms , with ovarian teratomas ( 94% ) being the most common.13 a recent large cohort study demonstrated that milder severity of symptoms , no need for intensive care , early immunotherapy , and prompt tumor removal were good prognostic factors.3 half of the patients had improvement in symptoms within 4 weeks after early immunotherapy . in another case report , the authors noted that steroid usage 3 months after onset of symptoms also resulted in significant improvements.3,5 the recovery phase might last for 18 months or longer.34 to maximize a patient s functional outcome , clinical practitioners need to be aware of this potentially curable disease and its common sequelae in order to organize rational , individualized rehabilitation programs.6,7 we report the long - term course of a young pediatric patient with recalcitrant anti - nmda receptor encephalitis and prolonged length of stay in hospital for 7 months . a young girl aged 3 years 2 months and without known medical or psychiatric history was admitted to our hospital due to personality changes that had persisted for 2 weeks . her condition progressed over the course of 12 days to behavioral regression , unsteady gait , headache , irritable crying , catatonia - like response , generalized choreoathetoid movements , orofacial dyskinesia , and collapsed lung , in successive order . as a result , she was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit . her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white - matter lesions over bilateral frontal lobes ( figure 1 ) . a complete etiologic', 'was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit . her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white - matter lesions over bilateral frontal lobes ( figure 1 ) . a complete etiologic investigation showed insufficient evidence of bacterial infection , electrolyte imbalance , intoxication , or endocrine disturbances . at first , under the clinical suspicion of meningoencephalitis , she was empirically treated with acyclovir plus azithromycin . after a cerebrospinal fluid nmda receptor antibody study reported positive results , the antibiotics were shifted to intravenous immunoglobulin for two courses , followed by pulse methylprednisolone therapy ( 30 mg / kg / dose , four doses ) and maintenance oral prednisolone ( 0.9 mg / kg / day ) . her choreoathetosis and orofacial dyskinesia recovered partially for several weeks , but these symptoms reappeared after we discontinued prednisolone because of her episodic sepsis , autonomic instability , and poorly - controlled gastrointestinal bleeding . the pediatric neurologist prescribed plasmaphoresis about 3 months after onset of symptoms , but it was discontinued because of anaphylactic reactions and bilateral pneumonia with collapsed lung . she received a combination therapy of weekly rituximab ( 375 mg / m , four doses ) and prolonged monthly cyclophosphamide pulse therapy ( 750 mg / m , 8 months ) , followed by azathioprine for 3 months . for her inpatient rehabilitation program , passive range - of - motion exercise was performed for her during periods of protracted sedation to prevent contracture . after cyclophosphamide and rituximab was applied for 6 weeks , her troublesome generalized choreoathetosis attenuated gradually . we started intensive facilitation and postural training after tapering off the sedative agents . in order to prevent oral dyskinesia - related aspiration and pneumonia the patient was discharged after a 7-month period of hospitalization , which required maximal assistance in mobility , self - care , and cognition domains as measured with the functional independence measure for children . for her outpatient rehabilitation , we arranged fixed physical , occupational , and speech therapists with whom she was familiar , and we placed her in an isolated setting to avoid distracting stimuli that might deteriorate her attention span , emotional status , and behavioral outbursts . at 12 months after the onset of symptoms ,']"

What bioelectric changes were observed in the pineal gland area of patients with AIS compared to healthy peers?,Increased bioelectric activity was observed in the pineal gland area of patients with AIS compared to healthy peers.,Increased bioelectric activity was observed in the pineal gland area of patients with AIS compared to healthy peers.,"['pineal and scn areas . the distribution in the number of dipoles ( as % of total number of recorded dipoles ) in the pineal gland area in patients with different ais severity and healthy subjects is presented in figure 2 . the figure shows that the lowest activity in the pineal gland was recorded in healthy subjects . in patients with ais the number progressively increased with worsening of the condition , achieved maximal values in patients with grade iii severity , and slightly decreased in patients with grade iv . among female patients with grade iv , girls aged 14 years predominated ( 57% of cases ) ; in this age group , the growth process and consequently the progress of deformation already slow down . instead , the total number of dipole sources in the right and left scn areas was inversely proportional ( figure 3)the greatest activity in the scn area was noted in healthy subjects . it gradually decreased with ais progress the worsening of the clinical condition worsening and again slightly increased in patients with grade iii and iv ais . differences in dipole quantities between healthy subjects and patients with different grades of ais severity are not statistically significant and in this case one can speak of an observed trend only . the most likely reason for the lack of significant differences is a limited resolution of the method used and significantly smaller scn sizes compared to the size of the pineal gland . thus , considerably more dipoles reflecting activity of adjacent brain structures were registered in the scn compared to the pineal area . the ratio of scn / pineal dipole quantity , in our opinion , may be an integral bioelectric characteristic of the relationship in the pineal gland research of the pineal gland scn system functioning in ais patients not only with varied spine deformation severity but also with varied progressive activity deserves special attention . bioelectric processes in central nervous system ( cns ) reflecting abnormalities in the normal pubertal period often stop by the time of radiological documentation of spinal curvature . in many cases , eegs of patients with grade iv ais and marked spinal deformation hardly differ from those of healthy peers . in figure 5 , ratios of scn to pineal gland dipole numbers are provided in groups of healthy subjects and patients with', 'points with minimal power are removed from sections by varying the observed / highest threshold ratio ;

gastroenterologists have a significantly higher rate of missed cancers than gastroenterologists , independent of procedural volume . the lack of an association between colonoscopy volume and missed cancers may indicate that even non - gastroenterologists who handle a high volume of procedures continue to miss more crcs than gastroenterologists . it may also indicate that formal endoscopic training generally leads to competency in colonoscopy , whereas providers who do not receive formal training are unable to achieve competence despite the volume of procedures they perform.12,47,48 a higher rate of interval cancers associated with index colonoscopies performed by general practice physicians was also found in studies from ontario and indiana.15,49 emerging evidence suggests a link between endoscopist specialty and colonoscopy quality in korea.50 to the best of our knowledge , there is no formal curriculum or guidelines in colonoscopy training for general practice physicians in korea . therefore , more stringent standards for training and assessment of colonoscopy quality are necessary to cope with the risk of interval cancer . generally , plaintiffs often allege inadequate performance of colonoscopy as the proximate cause of the interval cancer . to date , there is no published data on malpractice claims related with interval cancer . a review of malpractice claims filed with the physicians insurers association of america ( database queried between 1985 and 2008 ) determined that colonoscopy represents the highest frequency ( 41.5% ) of closed claims and the highest total indemnities ( $ 54,093,000 ) among gastrointestinal endoscopy claims.51 indeed , there was an average increase of 15.5% per year in total claim payments associated with colonoscopy , and the majority resulted from inadequate performance of an endoscopic procedure , followed by diagnosis error ( may include cases of interval cancer ) . in korea , a review of malpractice claims reported from the korea consumer agency ( database queried between 2009 and 2011 ) determined an increase of 205% in total claim consultations.52 in addition , the rate of diagnostic error for crcs was 6.8% of all', 'of interval cancer ) . in korea , a review of malpractice claims reported from the korea consumer agency ( database queried between 2009 and 2011 ) determined an increase of 205% in total claim consultations.52 in addition , the rate of diagnostic error for crcs was 6.8% of all cases of cancers associated with diagnostic errors . these data do not provide detailed information about interval cancer ; however , out anecdotal impression is that lawsuits alleging missed cancers are increasing . given the increased use of colonoscopy , the number of medicolegal litigation related to interval cancers would be logically expected to increase . colonoscopists are encouraged to reduce their risk by documenting the limitations of colonoscopy in the informed consent process and their data of colonoscopy quality ( e.g. , cecal intubation , bowel preparation , and withdrawal time ) . colonoscopists commonly discuss the complications of the procedure ; however , they seldom discuss the possibility of missed lesions and failure to prevent interval cancers.16 colonoscopy is not considered a perfect method by colonoscopists or by patients . informed consent may shift the burden of this reality from the colonoscopists to the patients . maintenance of an adequate level of colonoscopy quality indicators and detection of non - polypoid lesions , including ssas , especially in the right colon , may minimize the risk of medicolegal litigation related with interval cancer . considering the significant number of interval cancers that are encountered in daily clinical practice , the importance of adequate training and improvement of colonoscopy quality as causative factors in interval cancers should be highlighted . continuous monitoring of colonoscopy quality , which is amenable to improvement , can not be overstated to prevent the occurrence of interval cancers .', ""in right -

8 ] . in our case , the patient developed intraoperatively pneumothorax with hemodynamic instability . in cases of pneumothorax occurring during general anesthesia , such non - surgically related complications as barotrauma , damage to the bronchus during endotracheal intubation , rupture of congenital bulla or blebs , and side effects due to the insertion of a central venous catheter a central venous catheter was not inserted and an excessive extent of positive pressure ventilation was not performed . accordingly , the complications of this case were assumed to have occurred in association with the surgical procedure . based on the findings that the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters improved when the insufflation of co2 gas was discontinued , the occurrence of pneumothorax due to a non - surgical cause could be ruled out . for the current case , the first was that co2 entered the retroperitoneal space and then it entered the pleural space and mediastinum along the tissue plane . this might be consistent with the pathway for which the subcutaneous emphysema occurred in the neck and upper chest area in the current case . chien et al . reported on three patients who developed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and laryngopharyngeal areas . a hypothesis for the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema is that co2 enters the retroperitoneal space through a myopectineal dissection and then it reaches the neck . accordingly , it has been reported that setting the insufflation pressure of co2 below 10 mmhg and keeping the insufflation time below 2 hours are helpful for preventing pneumothorax . shim et al . reported that pneumothorax was occurred during retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy because insufflations pressures were over 15 mmhg . in the current case , the insufflation pressure was 12', 'was detected on the chest x - ray that was performed following the discontinuation of co2 insufflation , the possibility of the intraoperative occurrence of tension pneumothorax could not be ruled out . the co2 insufflation should be reduced or halted in cases in which pneumothorax is suspected or confirmed during laparoscopic tep herniorrhaphy . tube thoracostomy is not a mandatory procedure unless patients are hemodynamically unstable or their respiratory function is impaired because co2 is promptly diffused from the body . in most cases , the co2 is spontaneously lost within 30 -

surgical cause could be ruled out . for the current case , the first was that co2 entered the retroperitoneal space and then it entered the pleural space and mediastinum along the tissue plane . this might be consistent with the pathway for which the subcutaneous emphysema occurred in the neck and upper chest area in the current case . chien et al . reported on three patients who developed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and laryngopharyngeal areas . a hypothesis for the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema is that co2 enters the retroperitoneal space through a myopectineal dissection and then it reaches the neck . accordingly , it has been reported that setting the insufflation pressure of co2 below 10 mmhg and keeping the insufflation time below 2 hours are helpful for preventing pneumothorax . shim et al . reported that pneumothorax was occurred during retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy because insufflations pressures were over 15 mmhg . in the current case , the insufflation pressure was 12', 'produced a peak airway pressure of 17 - 18 mmhg . at the start of surgery , the end - tidal co2 was 32 mmhg , the peripheral o2 saturation was 99 - 100% , the blood pressure was 110/70 mmhg and the heart rate was 85 times / min . for the surgical procedure , with the use of a preperitoneal dissection balloon , a sufficient amount of space was secured between the posterior area of the transversus abdominus and the anterior area of the posterior rectus sheath and peritoneum . to secure the surgical vision in this extraperitoneal space , co2 after co2 insufflation , the peak inspiratory pressure and end - tidal co2 were 17 - 18 mmhg and 32 - 35 mmhg , respectively . about 50 minutes after insufflation , the peripheral o2 saturation decreased from 100% to 96% . the peak inspiratory airway pressure was 25 - 28 cmh2o and the end - tidal co2 was increased to 45 - 50 mmhg . the blood pressure was 80/48 mmhg and the heart rate was 102 times / min . after ephedrine 8 mg was administered , the blood pressure and heart rate increased to 110/55 mmhg and 110 times / min , respectively . at this time , the arterial blood gas analysis showed a ph of 7.34 , a paco2 of 58 mmhg , a pao2 of 75 mmhg and a sao2 of 95% . manual ventilation was performed at this time . when the breath sounds were auscultated , the left respiratory sounds were normal , but the right respiratory sounds were markedly decreased . under the suspicion that the endotracheal tube had migrated due to pneumoperitoneum or postural change , the tube was pulled out by 2 cm . auscultation was done after manual ventilation was performed several times . yet the respiratory sounds were not improved in the right lung . there were almost no mucus materials during the aspiration with using an aspiration catheter . at the same time , the presence of subcutaneous emphysema was confirmed in the bilateral submental regions , the shoulder and the upper thoracic area . but under the suspicion of pneumothorax in the right lung , a prompt resolution of the pneumoperitoneum was requested prior to further aggravating the condition of the patient . the surgical procedure was completed 15 minutes after the']"
What virus is commonly responsible for hospitalizations due to acute viral bronchiolitis in children under one year old in the United States?,Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV),Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is commonly responsible for hospitalizations due to acute viral bronchiolitis in children under one year old in the United States.,"['acute viral bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract disease in infants due to obstruction caused by inflammation of the tiny airways . almost all the infants up to 2 years old have been infected by this disease . evidences show that infection with respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is the cause of 50 to 80 thousand hospitalizations annually in children under one year old in the united states . bronchiolitis is considered as 60 percent of all the cases of lower respiratory infections in the early childhood and during the first year of life as well as 32 percent of hospitalized cases due to lower respiratory diseases in this age group . a systemic review from several randomized clinical trials on the effectiveness of beta - agonists suggested that these medications have short - term and less effect on the recovery of this disease . its treatment by epinephrine was first suggested in 1987 by wohl and chernick and since then , many studies and review articles have been published on this treatment method [ 68 ] . in the study of bertrand et al ( 2001 ) , in infants aged 1 to 12 months , mean duration of the hospitalization was 4.1 days in the epinephrine group and 5.2 days in the salbutamol group . langley et al in 2005 , in a study on infants aged between 6 weeks to 2 years showed that the efficacy of epinephrine had been better than salbutamol and caused earlier discharge of the children from the hospital in the epinephrine group ; also other studies demonstrated that the efficacy of salbutamol and epinephrine was similar [ 1113 ] . in other studies , the researchers announced that epinephrine led to earlier discharge of the patients from the hospital in comparison with salbutamol [ 1416 ] . in a meta - analysis study by hartling et al , the researchers found that in short - term treatment , epinephrine is preferred to salbutamol , but still there were no sufficient evidences available to confirm this theory conclusively . an appropriate treatment of this phenomenon can reduce the symptoms , hospitalization duration and exorbitant costs which is imposed on the families and insurance organizations . several conducted studies so far failed to prove the preference of epinephrine to salbutamol in treatment of bronchiolitis . therefore , this study was conducted to', 'treatment of this phenomenon can reduce the symptoms , hospitalization duration and exorbitant costs which is imposed on the families and insurance organizations . several conducted studies so far failed to prove the preference of epinephrine to salbutamol in treatment of bronchiolitis . therefore , this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of epinephrine in comparison with salbutamol on the treatment of the acute viral bronchiolitis . this study was done on 40 children > 2 years old during winter 2008 to spring 2008 in isfahan , iran . the target population included 1 month to 2 year old infants admitted to amin and al - zahra hospitals and diagnosed as acute bronchiolitis by the icu or ward physicians . children with history of two or more respiratory distresses , wheezing , family history of asthma , those who suffered from chronic pulmonary heart disease , suspected heart disease , bronchomalacia , previous use of bronchodilator and glucocorticoids , those treated with monoamino oxydase inhibitors ( maoi ) , tachycardia > 180/min , and respiratory rate > 100/min,[4 , 1016 ] were not included in the study . studied population was selected by nonrandomized simple sampling method and the children were placed in one of the two groups by the random allocation software . the first group was given one dose of 0.1 ml / kg l - epinephrine in a concentration of 1.10000 and the other group received salbutamol 0.15 mg / kg at a minimum volume of 1 mg mixed with normal saline . each volume was 3 cc , which was nebulized using oxygen flow 8 liters per minute . three doses of each medication at intervals of 20 minutes were prescribed ; 10 minutes after the third dose , the patient was rated again by respiratory distress assessment instrument ( rdai ) , the most commonly used tool for severity assessment . during this medication , no other medications like antibiotics and steroids were prescribed for them . in infants with fever , the level of oxygen saturation was measured on admission and daily after each prescription through pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) . vital signs were recorded completely at admission and daily , pulse rate ( pr ) and respiratory rate ( rr ) after each prescription and after the last prescription for 3 hours . this variable was measured in all cases that', 'children worldwide , as well as an important pathogen of the elderly and immune compromised ( bader and mckinsey 2005 ; ebbert and limper 2005 ; mejias et al 2005 ) the disease burden associated with rsv infection is considerable as rsv is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide having infection rates approaching 70%80% in the first year of life with many patients requiring hospitalization ( mccarthy and hall 2003 ; leung et al 2005 ) . unfortunately , despite five decades of research , no safe and effective rsv vaccine is available and few effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments are available . thus , there is a critical need for the development of novel tools and platforms to augment virus diagnosis and foundational studies required for development of disease intervention strategies . the surface topography of viruses lends to detection by antibodies , a feature that has been successfully used for bio - conjuagted np detection of rsv ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ; bentzen et al 2005 ) . rsv has two major surface proteins , ie , g and f proteins , that are primarily responsible for virus attachment and fusion , respectively ( tripp 2005 ) . both g and f proteins are recognized by the immune system as neutralizing antigens ; thus a majority of antibodies are directed toward these proteins ( tripp 2005 ) . the rsv f protein is more conserved than the g protein among rsv strains ( tripp 2005 ) , thus antibodies reactive to the f protein are ideal target developing bioconjugated nanoparticles . taking advantage of the composition - tunable emission of nps and their multivalent specificity when conjugated to monoclonal antibodies , we tested the ability of these bioconjugated nps to detect rsv infection in vitro and in vivo using in a single - step format . we show that bioconjugated nps can be used to rapidly and sensitively detect rsv infection in both cell lines and mice , and that the detection can be done in a single step format . this single - step format dramatically improves virus detection time , potentially saves costs , and reduces background staining that is currently associated with conventional virus detection methods . to develop bioconjugated nanoparticles to detect rsv infection , semiconductor cadmium telluride ( cdte ) quantum dots ( qds )', 'in 2003 , a 43-year - old white woman who had undergone a pulmonary lobectomy during childhood underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of severe chronic respiratory failure caused by bilateral bronchiectasis . the posttransplant period was complicated by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome stage 1 , with episodes of acute respiratory distress . the immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus ( through level 1015 ng / ml ) , low - dose steroids ( 0.10 mg / kg / day ) , and monthly courses of extracorporeal photopheresis that were initiated after a 3-month course of low - dose azythromycin ( discontinued because of lack of efficacy ) . in january 2012 she had cough and fever ( 38c ) , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea ( 610 bowel movements / day , liquid but not bloody ) . routine fecal examination and cultures were negative for common gastrointestinal bacteria ( mycobacteria , salmonella , shigella , and campylobacter spp . ) , parasites ( protozoa and helminths ) , and viruses ( astrovirus , norovirus , rotavirus , adenovirus ) . because of the patient s persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and a positive fecal calprotectin result , a colonoscopy was performed ; it revealed inflamed cecal mucosa without ulcerative lesions . histologic examination of colonic biopsy samples showed mild , chronic , interstitial inflammation , including eosinophils and lymphoid microaggregates . therefore , fecal samples were examined for less common gastroenteric viral agents rhinovirus , bocavirus , enterovirus , parechovirus , coronavirus , sapovirus , aichivirus and hcosv by using conventional and real - time pcr or nested reverse transcription pcr ( rt - pcr ) ( 1,714 ) . this virus was detected by a nested rt - pcr targeting the 5 untranslated region ( utr ) ( 1 ) and quantified on the basis of serial log10 dilution of extracted nucleic acid estimating the presence of 10 rna copies / ml in fecal samples . the 316-bp 5 utr amplicon was sequenced by using an abi prism 3100 dna automatic sequencer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , assembled by sequencer software , version 5.0 ( gene codes corporation , ann arbor , mi , usa ) , and compared with available hcosv sequences with the blast program ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) . nucleotide identity with the hcosv species d ( species d1 ) ( genbank accession no', 'before discovery of an effective vaccine , haemophilus influenzae type b ( hib ) was the most important cause of bacterial meningitis , otitis media , pneumonia , cellulitis , bacteremia , and septic arthritis in infants and children younger than five years ( 1 , 2 ) . it is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world , with as many as 3 million cases of serious disease occurring every year . the hib capsule is its major virulence factor , and is composed of a polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ( prp ) that can induce protective and effective immunity ( 3 ) . hib prp is a polymer of repeating monomeric units , structurally characterized as -d - ribose - d - ribitol - phosphate ( 4 , 5 ) . the first generation of vaccines for hib was licensed in the united states in 1985 , based on purified capsular polysaccharide ( 6 ) . this type of vaccine stimulates a t cell - independent immune response and prevents hib infections in children older than 2 years , but it does not protect infants ( 7 ) . since about 75% of hib infection cases occur in children younger than 2 years , second - generation hib vaccines , which induced t - cell dependent immune responses , were produced as prp - protein conjugates and licensed in the united states in 1987 ( 8) . the price of the conjugated prp vaccine is high ( 9 ) , and therefore a major challenge in hib vaccine production is to develop a cost - efficient vaccine . to enhance biomass and prp productions , most previous studies have focused on hib cultivation with respect to essential chemical , biochemical , and physical factors such as ph , dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , aeration , temperature , and agitation ( 10 - 12 ) . most of these studies employed single factors or multiple factors by changing one variable at a time , while keeping the others at a constant level . however , such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm )']"

What was the significant finding in the study regarding the hospitalization duration for patients receiving epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol?,The study found that there was a significant difference between hospitalization duration of the patients receiving epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol.,The significant finding in the study was that there was a significant difference in hospitalization duration for patients receiving epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol.,"['compared to those receiving salbutamol . in addition , there was a significant difference in assessing rdai index between the two groups of patients . to agree with the results of the present study , previous reports have found that the efficacy of epinephrine had been better than salbutamol and resulted in short - term clinical improvement and earlier discharge of the children from the hospital [ 9 , 10 , 1416 ] . also a meta - analysis study carried out by hartling and colleagues ( 2003 ) , established that short - term treatment with epinephrine is preferred to salbutamol , but still there were no sufficient evidences available to verify this theory conclusively . in contrast , in some studies the researchers demonstrated that the effectiveness of salbutamol and epinephrine was similar[1113 ] , which is not in accordance with the present study . walsh et al ( 2008 ) also showed that in children up to the 18th month of life , emergency department treatment of bronchiolitis with nebulized racemic albuterol led to more successful discharges than nebulized epinephrine . to our knowledge , the present study is the first study in iran that revealed the efficacy of nebulized epinephrine compared to nebulized salbutamol in the management of acute bronchiolitis . it is possible that the improvement has been related to the -effect of the medication . as a limitation and problem of the current study we could state the low sample size which was caused by the time and budget limitations considering that the studied researches in this regard could not confirm the preference of using epinephrine instead of salbutamol , further studies are needed with a larger sample size and more comprehensive level considering other relevant variables . a large number of multi - centered trials therefore are recommended to observe the efficacy of epinephrine compared to salbutamol and to capture clinically significant outcomes in patients with bronchiolitis . the obtained results of the present study in consistence with a number of other investigations , showed that using epinephrine instead of salbutamol , in 1 month to 2 year old infants with acute bronchiolitis , might be an effective step in improving the disease regarding its effect on the reduction of the hospitalization duration and the rdai index .', ""each prescription through pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) . vital signs were recorded completely at admission and daily , pulse rate ( pr ) and respiratory rate ( rr ) after each prescription and after the last prescription for 3 hours . this variable was measured in all cases that were given medication for bronchiolitis , patients who received oxygen because of bronchiolitis or underwent intravenous fluid therapy . this was a triple - blind study , i.e. the patient , physician and statistical analyst were unaware of the treatment . in this study 40 patients , consisting of 20 ( 50% ) males and 20 ( 50% ) females , were studied . the mean age of the patients was 387207.5 days ( range 52 - 710 days ) . mean age of the patients in salbutamol group was 409.6207.6 days and in epinephrine group 364210.4 days ( p=0.5 ) . mean and standard deviation of the patients ' weight was 9449.42767.3 ( range 4300 to 13650 ) gr . mean and standard deviation of the patients ' weight was 9871.22595.8 in patients receiving salbutamol and 9027.52933.7 in epinephrine group ( p=0.3 ) . regarding the association of used medication type and hospital stay , the mean and standard deviation of the patients ' hospitalization duration was 3.31.1 ; this was 3.71.1 with median of 4 ( minimum 2 and maximum 4 ) in the patients receiving salbutamol and 30.9 with median of 3 ( minimum 2 and maximum 4 ) in epinephrine patients ( p=0.03 ) . the mean and sd values of the obtained rdai from anova in repeated observations in the studied intervals in both groups are given in table 1 ( p=0.02 ) . mean ( standard deviation ) of rdai in the studied groups rdai : respiratory distress assessment instrument the present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of nebulized epinephrine versus nebulized salbutamol in the treatment and successful discharge of acute bronchiolitis . the outcome of this study showed that there was a significant difference between hospitalization duration of the patients receiving epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol . in addition , there was a significant difference in assessing rdai index between the two groups of patients . to agree with the results of the present study , previous reports have found that the efficacy of epinephrine had been better than salbutamol and"", 'treatment of this phenomenon can reduce the symptoms , hospitalization duration and exorbitant costs which is imposed on the families and insurance organizations . several conducted studies so far failed to prove the preference of epinephrine to salbutamol in treatment of bronchiolitis . therefore , this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of epinephrine in comparison with salbutamol on the treatment of the acute viral bronchiolitis . this study was done on 40 children > 2 years old during winter 2008 to spring 2008 in isfahan , iran . the target population included 1 month to 2 year old infants admitted to amin and al - zahra hospitals and diagnosed as acute bronchiolitis by the icu or ward physicians . children with history of two or more respiratory distresses , wheezing , family history of asthma , those who suffered from chronic pulmonary heart disease , suspected heart disease , bronchomalacia , previous use of bronchodilator and glucocorticoids , those treated with monoamino oxydase inhibitors ( maoi ) , tachycardia > 180/min , and respiratory rate > 100/min,[4 , 1016 ] were not included in the study . studied population was selected by nonrandomized simple sampling method and the children were placed in one of the two groups by the random allocation software . the first group was given one dose of 0.1 ml / kg l - epinephrine in a concentration of 1.10000 and the other group received salbutamol 0.15 mg / kg at a minimum volume of 1 mg mixed with normal saline . each volume was 3 cc , which was nebulized using oxygen flow 8 liters per minute . three doses of each medication at intervals of 20 minutes were prescribed ; 10 minutes after the third dose , the patient was rated again by respiratory distress assessment instrument ( rdai ) , the most commonly used tool for severity assessment . during this medication , no other medications like antibiotics and steroids were prescribed for them . in infants with fever , the level of oxygen saturation was measured on admission and daily after each prescription through pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) . vital signs were recorded completely at admission and daily , pulse rate ( pr ) and respiratory rate ( rr ) after each prescription and after the last prescription for 3 hours . this variable was measured in all cases that', 'acute viral bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract disease in infants due to obstruction caused by inflammation of the tiny airways . almost all the infants up to 2 years old have been infected by this disease . evidences show that infection with respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is the cause of 50 to 80 thousand hospitalizations annually in children under one year old in the united states . bronchiolitis is considered as 60 percent of all the cases of lower respiratory infections in the early childhood and during the first year of life as well as 32 percent of hospitalized cases due to lower respiratory diseases in this age group . a systemic review from several randomized clinical trials on the effectiveness of beta - agonists suggested that these medications have short - term and less effect on the recovery of this disease . its treatment by epinephrine was first suggested in 1987 by wohl and chernick and since then , many studies and review articles have been published on this treatment method [ 68 ] . in the study of bertrand et al ( 2001 ) , in infants aged 1 to 12 months , mean duration of the hospitalization was 4.1 days in the epinephrine group and 5.2 days in the salbutamol group . langley et al in 2005 , in a study on infants aged between 6 weeks to 2 years showed that the efficacy of epinephrine had been better than salbutamol and caused earlier discharge of the children from the hospital in the epinephrine group ; also other studies demonstrated that the efficacy of salbutamol and epinephrine was similar [ 1113 ] . in other studies , the researchers announced that epinephrine led to earlier discharge of the patients from the hospital in comparison with salbutamol [ 1416 ] . in a meta - analysis study by hartling et al , the researchers found that in short - term treatment , epinephrine is preferred to salbutamol , but still there were no sufficient evidences available to confirm this theory conclusively . an appropriate treatment of this phenomenon can reduce the symptoms , hospitalization duration and exorbitant costs which is imposed on the families and insurance organizations . several conducted studies so far failed to prove the preference of epinephrine to salbutamol in treatment of bronchiolitis . therefore , this study was conducted to', ""the unselected upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage cohort . in the sa group , 88 patients were receiving warfarin as stroke prophylaxis because of atrial fibrillation , 17 for a prosthetic heart valve , 16 for a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation , 4 for venous thromboembolism , and 3 for other reasons . there was a trend toward more benign endoscopic diagnoses in the sa group . in the patients with peptic ulceration , there was no significant difference in forrest classification between the two groups ( sa group : 10 of 42 class i , 5 of 42 class iia , 7 of 42 class iib ;

What method was used to measure social support in the obesity intervention study?,"Social support was measured from the respondent's perspective to assess the support (e.g., emotional, cognitive, and tangible support) an individual perceives to have.",Social support was measured from the respondent's perspective to assess the support an individual perceives to have.,"[""although obesity has stabilized in some us populations , it is still at epidemic proportions , with 31.7% of all children 219 years of age overweight or obese ( bmi 85th percentile ) . anti -

oriented relationships ( which may or may not provide support ) and treat the ties themselves as objects of study . social networks , the complex webs of social relationships and social interactions that connect individuals , have been shown to influence behaviors , whereas social support is generally thought not to influence behavior , but rather is considered a mechanism to cope with challenges and facilitate recovery from illness , injury , or disease . social network analysis allows us to see the whole group of individuals and their interconnectedness , identifying if new ties are established between people and what type of ties result . weak ties ( e.g. , acquaintances ) can introduce new ideas into a network , whereas strong ties ( e.g. , close friendships ) can facilitate the dissemination of behaviors through a network . diffusion studies show that people who are well integrated into a community ( have many ties ) generally adopt behaviors earlier than those who are less integrated ( have fewer ties ) [ 9 , 10 ] . although social networks exert measurable influence on our health [ 1121 ] , most of the work conducted focused on existing social networks . however , given that behavioral intervention trials often occur in a group context [ 2224 ] , measuring the development of new social networks and the ties that result is warranted ."", ""observed 3 modules of each condition ( totaling 25 sessions ) and determined that 100% of the intended key messages were fully discussed , all planned activities had occurred , and intervention content was never delivered during control sessions or vice versa . participants were randomized in equal proportion to each treatment group by using a computer generated permuted block randomization scheme , with blocks of size 10 . a biostatistician generated the randomization list and placed the assignments into nontransparent envelopes , which were sealed and numbered consecutively . after consent , participants received from the research coordinator the next numbered allocation envelope which was opened by the participant . the treatment assignment and number listed on the envelope were recorded by the research coordinator and the participant . all data were collected in spanish by trained data collectors at the community recreation center at baseline and at completion of the 3 month intervention . a social network survey was developed to assess change in social relationships over the course of the study period by capturing presence and absence of ties before and after the intervention . respondents indicated the type of relationship they had with each other study participant ( e.g. , no relationship , friend , and acquaintance ) . definitions for each type of relationship were provided in the instructions for consistent interpretation of these categories ( see the appendix ) . the whole network was defined as all trial participants , so respondents evaluated their ties to all study participants not just the ones in their own study condition , in order to obtain complete data for analysis . body weight was measured , while wearing light clothing without shoes after voiding , to the nearest 0.1 kg on a calibrated digital scale ( detecto , webb city , mo , usa , model no . body height without shoes was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the attached stadiometer . bmi was calculated ( weight ( kg)/height ( m ) ) . because the amount of body fat varies for children by age and sex , the bmi z -

What significant change in social network measures was observed after the obesity intervention among the intervention group participants?,"Intervention group members developed more friendship ties compared to the control group, and the degree to which a person's ties are with others who are connected to each other declined significantly more in the intervention group.","After the obesity intervention, the intervention group participants showed significant changes in all four measures of network structure (degree centrality, constraint, two-step reach, and density).","['network . alternatively , the observed selection effect might make it harder to intervene in individual behavior , in which case it would be prudent to counter the network effect by assigning parent - child dyads of varying bmi categories to work in groups together so that a high bmi is not seen as normative . building on these findings and computer simulations of large social networks conducted by bahr et al . , allowing parents to self - select partners in small group activities will likely lead them to cluster in social groups according to child bmi , and if unrestrained , current social forces will likely drive their children toward increasing obesity . it is also possible that just making parents aware of the tendency for mothers to selectively befriend mothers whose children have similar bmis might be a useful way to correct body size and adiposity perceptions . social ties in the control condition increased despite limited social interaction during the study period . this could reflect the fact that our study population , with low acculturation , feels socially isolated and yearns for connections with other latinos in the same stage of life . one of the strengths of this study is the inclusion of rigorous network control variables in the modeling to rule out alternative explanations of our findings . the analysis can not , however , rule out the effects of other individual differences in propensity to connect with others . we do not know if the new social ties were strong enough to withstand the test of time . the evaluation of whether newly constructed social networks influenced health behaviors ( i.e. , physical activity ) was untestable due to missing data . the analysis of whether newly constructed social networks influenced health outcomes ( i.e. , bmi ) yielded nonsignificant results . these questions can be examined with additional waves of data collection and larger samples with complete data . only friendship ties were reported ( no acquaintance or transactional partner ties ) . it is unclear if this finding is indicative of the strength of the groups or an artifact of how the question was asked . we did not collect any process measures of role rotation during the intervention sessions , or a measure of perceived group cohesion . as with most community studies , we had attrition over the', ""groups in the four measures of network structure ( degree centrality , constraint , two - step reach , and density ) . after the intervention , all network measures had changed in the predicted directions , in both intervention and control group , and all changes were significantly greater in the intervention group compared to the control group ( table 4 ) . the number of social ties people had with others in the network , averaged 1.5 at baseline . at study conclusion , intervention group members had developed more friendship ties compared to the control group ( 6.4 ties versus 3.9 ties ) . the degree to which a person 's ties are with others who are connected to each other , declined at the end of the study period , in both groups , but significantly more so in the intervention group . this means that intervention group members not only had more ties , but also those ties were less likely to be people who were already friends with each other . the proportion of people in the network that any individual could reach through their friends and the friends of their friends , increased in both groups but significantly more so for the intervention group . at the beginning of the intervention , any person in the intervention group could have reached only 3% of the other group participants , whereas after the intervention they could have reached 32% of the other group members . although density more than doubled in the intervention group compared to the control group , at study completion the intervention group network was still a sparse network with fairly low density . the jaccard index , which measures how much change ( related to ties created and ties dropped ) occurs between points of data collection , was .256 . although a jaccard index of .3 is recommended for discerning structural equivalence sets , in this study the slightly lower jaccard index is considered acceptable given that the program brought together many mothers previously unknown to one another . the model convergence was good as indicated by all t - ratio diagnostics being close to zero . the negative parameter for outdegree was expected because most observed networks are sparse with densities well below .50 . this makes intuitive sense in terms of the limit on the number of"", ""misperceptions of child weight status are well documented , even among parents of preschool aged children [ 46 , 47 ] , and affect the likelihood that parents will take action to ameliorate their child 's weight problem . we did not find overweight mothers to be more likely to select other overweight mothers as friends . our null result is likely due to the low variability in our sample ( more than 90% of participating mothers were obese ) and small sample size for detecting selection effects . others have clearly shown that adult and adolescent friendships cluster on the basis of weight status [ 6 , 13 , 15 , 45 ] . there is evidence that social networks can spread positive health behaviors , such as smoking cessation , contraception use , and reduced drug and alcohol use [ 12 , 1517 , 44 ] . such findings raise the question of whether social networks either existing or newly constructed might also spread obesity - protecting behaviors , such as physical activity , consumption of fruits and vegetables , or sleep hygiene . this research lays the groundwork for understanding that new social networks can be formed in group - level interventions . prudent next steps would be to examine the extent to which novel interventions could build new social networks to intentionally spread health behaviors . to explore such effects , future health studies should include social network data . this study is a necessary first step in using social network analysis to strengthen group - based behavioral interventions that can be utilized in trials that aim to prevent or treat obesity . given that many obesity prevention and early intervention behavioral trials utilize group settings , understanding new network formation could influence future trial design and implementation . future group - based interventions might leverage the observed selection effect ( mothers forming friendships based on child bmi ) to intentionally increase group cohesion which , under favorable network conditions , may accelerate the uptake of prohealth knowledge , attitudes , and behavior across the whole network . alternatively , the observed selection effect might make it harder to intervene in individual behavior , in which case it would be prudent to counter the network effect by assigning parent -

obesity efforts often fail [ 2 , 3 ] , and exactly why they fail is still unclear . the discouraging results of many studies , including the largest , most rigorous antiobesity trials to be completed , suggest that interventions must be informed by an understanding of the multifactorial forces shaping obesity - related behaviors , including the social environment [ 36 ] . social context influences both the routine practice of healthy behaviors and the establishment of norms . methodologically , social support is measured from the respondent 's perspective to assess the support ( e.g. , emotional , cognitive , and tangible support ) an individual perceives to have , whereas social networks typically measure the presence or absence of friendships and task- or work - oriented relationships ( which may or may not provide support ) and treat the ties themselves as objects of study . social networks , the complex webs of social relationships and social interactions that connect individuals , have been shown to influence behaviors , whereas social support is generally thought not to influence behavior , but rather is considered a mechanism to cope with challenges and facilitate recovery from illness , injury , or disease . social network analysis allows us to see the whole group of individuals and their interconnectedness , identifying if new ties are established between people and what type of ties result . weak ties ( e.g. , acquaintances ) can introduce new ideas into a network , whereas strong ties ( e.g. , close friendships ) can facilitate the dissemination of behaviors through a network . diffusion studies show that people who are well integrated into a community ( have many ties ) generally adopt behaviors earlier than those who are less integrated ( have fewer ties ) [ 9 , 10 ] . although social networks exert measurable influence on our health [ 1121 ] , most of the work conducted focused on existing social networks . however , given that behavioral intervention trials often occur in a group context [ 2224 ] , measuring the development of new social networks and the ties that result is warranted ."", ""on our health [ 1121 ] , most of the work conducted focused on existing social networks . however , given that behavioral intervention trials often occur in a group context [ 2224 ] , measuring the development of new social networks and the ties that result is warranted . once this question is answered , we can determine how to utilize this approach to potentially spread desired behaviors through new networks . therefore , we set out to examine if families participating in a group -

( 7 ) they were started on thyroxine after rra to suppress tsh below 0.1 in intermediate and high risk group and below 0.5 in low risk group ; and ( 8) they get their stsh , stg , anti - tg , neck ultrasound , and diagnostic wbis 612 months after rra . diagnostic wbis was performed 48 hours after giving 2 mci of i. we used dual head digital gamma camera ( ecam , siemens , germany ) for both posttherapeutic and diagnostic wbis . we assessed the following variables as a possible predictor of successful ablation : stg before rra , stg / tsh ratio before rra , age , sex , rra dose , postablative wbis findings , tnm staging , and histology ( follicular or papillary ) . successful ablation is defined as stg < 2 ng / ml with negative anti - tg antibodies , no evidence of tumor on diagnostic wbis as well as on neck ultrasound 612 months after rra . tsh was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.008 uiu / ml', ""successful ablation is defined as stg < 2 ng / ml with negative anti - tg antibodies , no evidence of tumor on diagnostic wbis as well as on neck ultrasound 612 months after rra . tsh was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.008 uiu / ml , functional sensitivity of 0.008 uiu / ml , and reportable range of 0.008 to 150 uiu / ml . tg was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.2 ng / ml and functional sensitivity of 0.9 ng / ml interassay for values higher than 2 ng / ml . anti - tg antibodies were measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 2.2 iu / ml , interassay precision of 4.65.8% , and intra - assay precision of 3.24.9% with reportable range of 203000 iu / ml and normal range < 40 iu / ml . comparative analysis was done using student 's t - test or wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and chi - square test for categorical variables . cutoff values of serum preablation stg and stg / tsh were determined and receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves were generated using roc analysis . univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to see the predictors of successful ablation . for the analysis p value records of 75 patients who fulfilled our criteria were retrieved . out of these 60% ( 45 ) had successful ablation , while 40% ( 30 ) had unsuccessful ablation . there was no significant difference between two groups , that is , patients with successful ablation and unsuccessful ablation with respect to age and gender . most of the tumors were papillary carcinomas 91.9% and 90% in successful and unsuccessful groups , respectively . similarly no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in size of tumor , capsular invasion , pathological and tnm tumor stages , lymph node involvement , ata risk , and the dose of radioactive iodine given . however more distant metastasis was seen in unsuccessful group as compared to successful group and this difference was statistically significant . there was also significant difference in lower median levels of stg and stg / tsh ratio in patients with successful and unsuccessful ablation ; that is , lower median level of stg is 3.05 ( 0.2014.5 ) among patients with successful ablation"", ') with sensitivity of 71.4% , specificity of 70.2% , ppv of 71.4% , and npv of 70.2% . another recent study conducted in china showed that in patients with dtc who underwent total thyroidectomy , stg and its ratio with tsh before rra might be considered as predictive markers for metastasis . we used diagnostic wbis as an exclusion criterion due to its low impact on the decision to ablate and because of concerns over i induced stunning of normal thyroid remnants and distant metastases from thyroid cancer . this is first attempt to assess the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome , which was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome than stg . in this study , factors such as age , gender , type of tumor , size of tumor , and capsular invasion were not found to be significantly associated with rra outcome , while stg levels are significantly associated , a finding which is consistent with other studies [ 1 , 2731 ] . important finding of our study is association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome . we found that stg / tsh ratio had stronger association with ablation outcome than stg . as stg / tsh ratio was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome ; therefore , it can help us in predicting the success of rra and we hypothesized that it might also help in adjusting the dose of i. this adjustment in the dose of iremnant ablative dose might be very important particularly in low risk dtc where there is still no consensus on optimal dose . cutoff value of 18 ng / ml for stg from our study is consistent with other studies from brazil , but our sensitivity and specificity are higher than those reported earlier for cutoff value of 18 ng / ml . since no cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio was available ; therefore , we also determined cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio , that is , 0.35 for predicting ablation outcome . these cutoff values for stg and stg / tsh ratio in our study have high sensitivity and specificity in predicting the outcome . this study is one of its kinds , investigating the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome in patients with dtc . we found that patients']"

thus , close clinical observation and follow - up are recommended . the proliferation of follicular cells in the nodular goiter may be associated with a greater possibility of atypical hyperplasia and vascular proliferation . the reason may be that hashimoto thyroiditis increases the patient 's immune response , leading to hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells through stimulation of lymphocytes and results in the occurrence of atypical hyperplasia at the focus transitional zone . owing to the low incidence but high malignant potential , pdtc is not well recognized and is often discovered incidentally during treatment when it has metastasized to lymph nodes or distant organs . as it is reported in the literature , pdtc is characterized by rapid , invasive growth , and higher mortality rate than ptc and is prone to lymphatic and other remote metastases . accurate preoperative diagnosis , clinical staging , and risk assessment are very important to help make the treatment protocol and establish prognosis . ultrasound is a valid method for diagnosis and follow - up of thyroid carcinoma . with the help of ultrasound - guided fna biopsy , thyroid carcinoma at an early stage however , there are many reports of the misdiagnosis of pdtc ; fna may reveal a follicular tumor , follicular variant of ptc , adenomatous nodule , or ptc . this may be related to the larger size , rapid invasive growth , limited amount of sample , and necrosis of the interested area of pdtc . if we do not take positive and effective intervention for the above cases , we may miss the best time for treatment and improving the prognosis . our study showed that pdtc and ptc have a variety of ultrasound features in common , such as irregular shape , taller - than - wide , hypoechoic , heterogeneous , solid mass , and micro - calcification , and these characters are the indicators of suspicious malignant tumor . in addition , three following features suggest that the lesion may be pdtc :"", ""a student 's t - test was used for comparison of patient ages and the size of nodules . fisher 's exact test was used for comparison of clinical and ultrasonic features and mortality rate . patients with pdtc had a significantly higher frequency of family history of carcinoma than those with ptc ( 30.8% vs. 2.6% , respectively ) and also had a higher proportion of multiple thyroid lesions including nodular goiter and hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( 61.6% vs. 23.1% , respectively ) . nine cases of pdtc ( 69.2% ) had lymph node metastases , which was significantly higher than ptc ( 25.6% , p = 0.007 ) . a statistically significant difference was also seen between the number of patients with hoarseness and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury between ptdc ( n = 3 ;

( 4 ) those who received rra ; ( 5)those having posttherapeutic wbis ; ( 6 ) those having neck ultrasound , diagnostic wbis , and stg ; and ( 7 ) anti - tg at 612 months after rra . we excluded patients with ( 1 ) less then total thyroidectomy , that is , subtotal"", ""successful ablation is defined as stg < 2 ng / ml with negative anti - tg antibodies , no evidence of tumor on diagnostic wbis as well as on neck ultrasound 612 months after rra . tsh was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.008 uiu / ml , functional sensitivity of 0.008 uiu / ml , and reportable range of 0.008 to 150 uiu / ml . tg was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.2 ng / ml and functional sensitivity of 0.9 ng / ml interassay for values higher than 2 ng / ml . anti - tg antibodies were measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 2.2 iu / ml , interassay precision of 4.65.8% , and intra - assay precision of 3.24.9% with reportable range of 203000 iu / ml and normal range < 40 iu / ml . comparative analysis was done using student 's t - test or wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and chi - square test for categorical variables . cutoff values of serum preablation stg and stg / tsh were determined and receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves were generated using roc analysis . univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to see the predictors of successful ablation . for the analysis p value records of 75 patients who fulfilled our criteria were retrieved . out of these 60% ( 45 ) had successful ablation , while 40% ( 30 ) had unsuccessful ablation . there was no significant difference between two groups , that is , patients with successful ablation and unsuccessful ablation with respect to age and gender . most of the tumors were papillary carcinomas 91.9% and 90% in successful and unsuccessful groups , respectively . similarly no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in size of tumor , capsular invasion , pathological and tnm tumor stages , lymph node involvement , ata risk , and the dose of radioactive iodine given . however more distant metastasis was seen in unsuccessful group as compared to successful group and this difference was statistically significant . there was also significant difference in lower median levels of stg and stg / tsh ratio in patients with successful and unsuccessful ablation ; that is , lower median level of stg is 3.05 ( 0.2014.5 ) among patients with successful ablation"", '; ( 5)those having posttherapeutic wbis ; ( 6 ) those having neck ultrasound , diagnostic wbis , and stg ; and ( 7 ) anti - tg at 612 months after rra . we excluded patients with ( 1 ) less then total thyroidectomy , that is , subtotal thyroidectomy or lobectomy ; ( 2 ) diagnostic wbis done before rra because of possible stunning effect and low sensitivity ; ( 3 ) anti - tg > 40 iu / ml prior to rra as it might influence the absolute value of stg . all 75 patients were treated as per following protocol : ( 1 ) they underwent total thyroidectomy ; ( 2 ) they were without thyroxine replacement for 3 - 4 weeks following surgery ; ( 3 ) they were on low iodine diet for 2 weeks prior to rra ; ( 4 ) they got their stsh , stg , and anti - tg done approximately 2 - 3 days prior to rra ; ( 5 ) they received rra of 30 to 100 mci in ata low risk , 150 mci in ata intermediate risk , and 200 mci in ata high risk groups ; ( 6 ) they got their posttherapeutic wbis done 3 to 5 days after rra ; ( 7 ) they were started on thyroxine after rra to suppress tsh below 0.1 in intermediate and high risk group and below 0.5 in low risk group ; and ( 8) they get their stsh , stg , anti - tg , neck ultrasound , and diagnostic wbis 612 months after rra . diagnostic wbis was performed 48 hours after giving 2 mci of i. we used dual head digital gamma camera ( ecam , siemens , germany ) for both posttherapeutic and diagnostic wbis . we assessed the following variables as a possible predictor of successful ablation : stg before rra , stg / tsh ratio before rra , age , sex , rra dose , postablative wbis findings , tnm staging , and histology ( follicular or papillary ) . successful ablation is defined as stg < 2 ng / ml with negative anti - tg antibodies , no evidence of tumor on diagnostic wbis as well as on neck ultrasound 612 months after rra . tsh was measured using chemiluminescent assays with analytical sensitivity of 0.008 uiu / ml', ') with sensitivity of 71.4% , specificity of 70.2% , ppv of 71.4% , and npv of 70.2% . another recent study conducted in china showed that in patients with dtc who underwent total thyroidectomy , stg and its ratio with tsh before rra might be considered as predictive markers for metastasis . we used diagnostic wbis as an exclusion criterion due to its low impact on the decision to ablate and because of concerns over i induced stunning of normal thyroid remnants and distant metastases from thyroid cancer . this is first attempt to assess the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome , which was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome than stg . in this study , factors such as age , gender , type of tumor , size of tumor , and capsular invasion were not found to be significantly associated with rra outcome , while stg levels are significantly associated , a finding which is consistent with other studies [ 1 , 2731 ] . important finding of our study is association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome . we found that stg / tsh ratio had stronger association with ablation outcome than stg . as stg / tsh ratio was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome ; therefore , it can help us in predicting the success of rra and we hypothesized that it might also help in adjusting the dose of i. this adjustment in the dose of iremnant ablative dose might be very important particularly in low risk dtc where there is still no consensus on optimal dose . cutoff value of 18 ng / ml for stg from our study is consistent with other studies from brazil , but our sensitivity and specificity are higher than those reported earlier for cutoff value of 18 ng / ml . since no cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio was available ; therefore , we also determined cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio , that is , 0.35 for predicting ablation outcome . these cutoff values for stg and stg / tsh ratio in our study have high sensitivity and specificity in predicting the outcome . this study is one of its kinds , investigating the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome in patients with dtc . we found that patients']"
What percentage of neonatal deaths occur in developing countries according to the WHO report?,99%,99%,"['in 2006 , the world health organization ( who ) reported that out of the 130 million live births every year , 4 million die within the first four weeks of life . of these deaths , 99% occur in developing countries ( approximately half following difficult deliveries at home ) against 1% in developed countries . most of these deaths ( 30 - 40% ) are due to neonatal infections . according to the 2004 demographic health survey in cameroon , neonatal infections are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths , thus constituting a major public health problem . in cameroon and in most developing countries , a combination of three parenteral antibiotics - ampicillin , aminoside and a third generation cephalosporin which cover a broad spectrum of germs , is instituted to treat neonatal infections while awaiting culture and sensitivity tests . yet neonatal infections still claim the lives of many children in this setting . this study was aimed at determining the incidence and risk factors of neonatal bacterial infections , the clinical and bacteriological profile and sensitivity to antibiotics used , and the clinical outcomes in a referral mother and child hospital . the study was a prospective study in the neonatology unit of the yaounde gynaeco - obstetric and pediatric hospital , from the 18 november 2008 to 18 may 2009 . the study population consisted of all symptomatic neonates ( 0 to 28 days ) with a maternal history suggestive of infection admitted in this unit within the study period . patient selection was done in two phases : phase 1 : all the neonates , in -

cutaneous signs ( 41.7% ) were most frequent . the most frequent risk factors found in our study are not different from those described by other authors . we found that the most frequent risk factors for infection were unexplained prematurity with gestational age < 35 weeks and prom . in other studies , the most frequent factors were foul - smelling vaginal discharge and prom , or prematurity and cervico - vaginal infections . in developed countries especially in france , abnormal amniotic fluid and prom were most frequent . according to the french national agency for accreditation and health , prom , premature gestation and perinatal maternal fever above 38c are major factors in neonatal infection . early - onset neonatal sepsis was by far the most frequent clinical presentation in 87.61% of the neonates , and is comparable to the rates from other african studies[16 , 17 ] and developing countries studies . this finding could imply that contamination occurred before or during delivery therefore highlighting the importance of good antenatal and perinatal care in order to prevent neonatal infections . the bacterial ecology was dominated by gram negative bacilli in both the early and late neonatal periods , although we had only 42 neonates with positive cultures . from all the germs this high prevalence of gram negative bacteria compared to gram positive has also been found in many other studies in other developing countries [ 14 , 18 , 19 ] . the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis in developing countries differ from those in developed countries . overall , gram negative pathogens are more common and group streptococcus , is generally rare . the small number of positive cultures reflects the difficulties neonatologists encounter when investigating babies with patent clinical', 'birth weight neonates have 20 times more risk of dying than those of normal weight . aboussad et al in morrocco , observed that prematurity was a risk factor for death , whereas in france , prematurity was observed to be a criterion denoting severity of neonatal infection . escherichia coli , klebsiella spp and enterobacter spp were the most frequent germs responsible for the deaths . these findings are similar to those of cisse et al in the dakar university teaching hospital . this study and others , demonstrate that the germs usually responsible for mortality are those which are most resistant to empirical treatment . we think new guidelines need to be drawn , coupled with larger more recent bodies of evidence to combat neonatal infections and reduce neonatal death in settings with limited diagnostic resources . strengths and limitations : this study is the first prospective study of its kind in this setting which is a mother and child referral hospital in the capital yaounde , the capital city of cameroon . the results obtained will serve as baseline data for future larger prospective studies . the fact that infection was confirmed bacteriologically in only 42 neonates is a major limitation of our study . some of the neonates had been through other health facilities where antibiotherapy was administered before being referred to the hospital , coupled with the fact that some parents could not pay for laboratory tests , and the small sample size . this however emphasizes the need for up to date knowledge on the management of neonatal infections in the absence of laboratory confirmation especially in low resource settings . we conclude that neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates in cameroon despite recent improvements in the health care system . the emergence of resistant bacterial strains to commonly used antibiotics in this low resource setting is a serious problem . we thus recommend the rational use of first line antibiotics in the management of neonatal sepsis with periodic evaluation of the bacterial ecology and sensitivity to antibiotics .', 'frequent germs isolated in respectively 28.6% , 21.4% and 14.3% of the neonates . germs cultured in the different samples csf : cerebrospinal fluid septicemia was the most frequent presentation in the early neonatal period with 23 ( 54.8% ) positive cultures , and urinary tract infection most frequent in the late neonatal period with 5 ( 12% ) positive cultures .

mortality are those which are most resistant to empirical treatment . we think new guidelines need to be drawn , coupled with larger more recent bodies of evidence to combat neonatal infections and reduce neonatal death in settings with limited diagnostic resources . strengths and limitations : this study is the first prospective study of its kind in this setting which is a mother and child referral hospital in the capital yaounde , the capital city of cameroon . the results obtained will serve as baseline data for future larger prospective studies . the fact that infection was confirmed bacteriologically in only 42 neonates is a major limitation of our study . some of the neonates had been through other health facilities where antibiotherapy was administered before being referred to the hospital , coupled with the fact that some parents could not pay for laboratory tests , and the small sample size . this however emphasizes the need for up to date knowledge on the management of neonatal infections in the absence of laboratory confirmation especially in low resource settings . we conclude that neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates in cameroon despite recent improvements in the health care system . the emergence of resistant bacterial strains to commonly used antibiotics in this low resource setting is a serious problem . we thus recommend the rational use of first line antibiotics in the management of neonatal sepsis with periodic evaluation of the bacterial ecology and sensitivity to antibiotics .', 'prevalence of all risk factors increased with vat tertile in our sample ) , they do support the notion that such a theory is , at best , incomplete because it does not explain either the detrimental or the beneficial effects of sat , which does not drain through the portal vein , on cardiometabolic risk . vat and sat differ not only in anatomic location but also in cytokine secretion profile . sat releases 23 times more leptin than vat ( 24 ) , whereas vat secretes more adiponectin , interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 , and angiotensin than does sat ( 23 ) . although the relationships between vat and sat secretion profiles and cardiometabolic pathogenesis are , at present , unclear , it may be that paracrine and perhaps endocrine factors contribute to the differential effects of vat and sat . it is important to note that our results suggest a possible protective effect of sat only among those in the highest tertile of vat . indeed , in the lower vat tertiles , increasing sat one explanation for this difference is that there is a relatively larger increase in vat in the lower tertiles and that sat is simply a marker for increased vat in these groups . sat by itself may not be deleterious or beneficial in the absence of the positive energy balance of obesity . accordingly , sat may only be protective in obese individuals because these individuals are already in positive energy balance and sat provides a nonpathological energy storage depot . it is also important to note that the lack of increase in the prevalence of risk factors such as low ldl and impaired fasting glucose with increasing sat among the obese may be due to a threshold effect , whereby risk factor prevalence is already so high that increasing sat is not associated with further increases in prevalence . compared with previous work on subcutaneous fat and cardiometabolic risk , the strengths of the present study include a large sample size with a wide range of bmi and age , thereby reducing the likelihood of ascertainment bias in the results . in addition , the study benefits from the quantification of fat volumes from ct scans rather than a single - slice measurement of fat area . a major limitation of the study is its lack of']"
What are some of the possible explanations for better ICU outcomes in obese patients today compared to the past?,"The possible explanations include heightened attention to the needs of obese patients resulting in improved outcomes, the inadvertent underdosing of fluids and vasopressors having a protective effect, and advances in support equipment, glycemic control, and ventilation protocols.","Possible explanations for better ICU outcomes in obese patients today compared to the past include:

1. Heightened attention and improved protocols: ICU's have developed better protocols for turning, skin care, mobilization, oral care, and pulmonary toilet for obese patients. This increased attention to their care may have contributed to improved outcomes.

2. Inadvertent 'under' dosing of fluids and vasopressors: It is possible that the practice of unintentionally administering lower doses of fluids and vasopressors to obese patients may have conferred a protective effect.

3. Improved diagnostic capabilities: Imaging tables that support the weight of morbidly obese patients have improved the diagnosis of life-threatening illnesses. This could potentially lead to better treatment and outcomes.

differentiated thyroid cancer with postsurgical stimulated thyroglobulin ( stg ) < 1 ng / ml , an approach not yet approved by american thyroid association ( ata ) [ 68 ] . the theoretical goals of adjuvant ablation are ( a ) to destroy any residual microscopic disease , ( b ) to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic whole body iodine scan ( wbis ) and specificity of serum thyroglobulin ( tg ) which facilitates follow - up and early detection of recurrence or metastatic disease , and ( c ) to use postablative wbis which is more sensitive than diagnostic wbis for detection of nodal or distant functioning metastases . according to ata guidelines , stg and neck ultrasound with or without diagnostic wbis should be done 612 months after rra in these patients to see the presence or absence of disease . an area of ongoing controversy is the optimal dose of rai required to successfully ablate remnant tissue after total or near - total thyroidectomy with a single administration in low risk group . this can be achieved by either dosimetry method introduced by benua et al . or by fixed empiric activity of rai . , about 30,000 rad ( 300 gy ) radiation dose to thyroid bed was required for successful ablation and bal cs and padhy found 50 mci ( 1850 mbq ) of rai to deliver this required dose to thyroid bed after total thyroidectomy [ 11 , 12 ] . however , due to cumbersomeness of dosimetry method , the majority of treating physicians have adopted fixed empiric activity of rai ( 30200 mci or 11107400 mbq ) with no consensus about adequate ablative dose in low risk patients . due to these variable results , there has been lack of consensus among various thyroid organizations on the optimum rai dose for remnant ablation in', 'reported to localize to the lower areas in each crypt ( 12 ) . it was revealed that radiation induced apoptosis in the low positions from the base of the crypt axis , which was reduced following pz treatment . in addition , the present study also demonstrated the radioprotective effect of pz in the established -

Which radiotherapeutic modality has been shown to significantly decrease the toxicities of radiotherapy?,Intensity-modulated radiation therapy and proton therapy,Intensity-modulated radiation therapy and proton therapy.,"['radiation - induced gastrointestinal disorder is the most common complication of toxicity due to the treatment for malignancies in the abdomen and pelvis , which often reduces the quality of life ( qol ) for patients and occasionally limits the therapeutic dose that can be used for treating abdominal and pelvic tumors with radiotherapy . modern radiotherapeutic modalities , including intensity - modulated radiation therapy and proton therapy , can significantly decrease the toxicities of radiotherapy and can benefit the outcomes ( 1 ) . amifostine has been recommended for the prevention of severe radiation - induced toxicities and is the only radioprotectant that has been approved by the us food and drug administration ( 2 ) . however , the daily use of amifostine has been limited due to its hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity . polaprezinc ( pz ) is an antiulcer drug and a chelating compound consisting of a zinc ion , l - carnosine , a -alanine dipeptide and l - histidine . it was previously reported that pz exerts antioxidant effects and scavenges free radicals ( 35 ) . our previous study reported the efficacy of pz for acute radiation proctitis in an animal model and demonstrated that pz has an anti - inflammatory effect following exposure to radiation ( 6 ) . however , the radioprotective effects of pz have been reported in only a limited number of reports and remain unclear ( 69 ) . the purpose of the present study was to examine the optimal timing to administer pz and the pattern of apoptosis in the normal intestine . it is important that premedication of the clinical medicine enables the prevention of radiation injuries . male c57bl/6j mice ( 8-weeks - old ; weight , ~20 g ) were used in the present study . they were housed 45/cage and fed a laboratory rodent pellet formula and tap water ad libitum . mice were maintained at a constant temperature of 22c0.5c , a humidity of 50%5% and were exposed to 12 h light / dark cycles . the hyogo college of medicine institutional animal care and use committee approved all animal procedures prior to the initiation of the project ( nos . the mice orally received 100 mg / kg body weight pz in the drinking water . the mice were irradiated at a dose rate of ~200 cgy / min using a', 'reported to localize to the lower areas in each crypt ( 12 ) . it was revealed that radiation induced apoptosis in the low positions from the base of the crypt axis , which was reduced following pz treatment . in addition , the present study also demonstrated the radioprotective effect of pz in the established -

inflammatory effect of pz on radiation - induced mucosal damage ( 6 ) . in addition , the clinical use of pz has been reported to be feasible and can increase a patient 's qol during radiotherapy ( 8,9 ) . in the present study , the pretreatment of pz revealed improved protective effects in the mice that received pz prior to radiation exposure compared with those that received pz after radiation exposure and those that were irradiated without pz . this is the first report , to the best of our knowledge , that demonstrated the optimal timing for pz treatment as a radioprotectant . radiotherapy is generally performed in a fractionated schedule with the aim of maximizing the anti - tumor effect and minimizing the toxicity of normal organs in the clinical practice . however , the present study used a single fraction schedule to examine the efficacy of pz . therefore , the optimization of the administration of pz and ir must be evaluated in future studies . matsuu - matsuyama et al ( 7 ) have reported that pz can protect the normal intestine from radiation - induced apoptosis via the suppression of p53 , p21 and b - cell associated x protein genes . however , the mechanism of the radioprotective effect of pz treatment for radiation - induced mucosal damages remains to be investigated in greater detail . the present study examined the potential differences in the sensitivity of pz treatment in various positions of the crypts in the intestine since intestinal stem cells , which are critical drivers of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration , have been reported to localize to the lower areas in each crypt ( 12 ) . it was revealed that radiation induced apoptosis in the low positions from the base of the crypt axis , which was reduced following pz treatment . in addition , the present study also demonstrated the radioprotective"", 'animal care and use committee approved all animal procedures prior to the initiation of the project ( nos . the mice orally received 100 mg / kg body weight pz in the drinking water . the mice were irradiated at a dose rate of ~200 cgy / min using a 150 kvp x -

What is the main purpose of the study described in the article?,To examine the optimal timing to administer polaprezinc and the pattern of apoptosis in the normal intestine,The main purpose of the study described in the article is to assess the effectiveness of a best practice program in improving the health behaviors of participants.,"[""observed 3 modules of each condition ( totaling 25 sessions ) and determined that 100% of the intended key messages were fully discussed , all planned activities had occurred , and intervention content was never delivered during control sessions or vice versa . participants were randomized in equal proportion to each treatment group by using a computer generated permuted block randomization scheme , with blocks of size 10 . a biostatistician generated the randomization list and placed the assignments into nontransparent envelopes , which were sealed and numbered consecutively . after consent , participants received from the research coordinator the next numbered allocation envelope which was opened by the participant . the treatment assignment and number listed on the envelope were recorded by the research coordinator and the participant . all data were collected in spanish by trained data collectors at the community recreation center at baseline and at completion of the 3 month intervention . a social network survey was developed to assess change in social relationships over the course of the study period by capturing presence and absence of ties before and after the intervention . respondents indicated the type of relationship they had with each other study participant ( e.g. , no relationship , friend , and acquaintance ) . definitions for each type of relationship were provided in the instructions for consistent interpretation of these categories ( see the appendix ) . the whole network was defined as all trial participants , so respondents evaluated their ties to all study participants not just the ones in their own study condition , in order to obtain complete data for analysis . body weight was measured , while wearing light clothing without shoes after voiding , to the nearest 0.1 kg on a calibrated digital scale ( detecto , webb city , mo , usa , model no . body height without shoes was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the attached stadiometer . bmi was calculated ( weight ( kg)/height ( m ) ) . because the amount of body fat varies for children by age and sex , the bmi z - score was computed using the calculator from the children 's hospital of philadelphia based on the cdc growth charts . acculturation was measured using the widely used and previously validated short - acculturation scale for hispanics ( sash ) , with internal reliability"", 'of the study findings , we performed data analysis concurrently with data collection and employed the constant comparison analysis , active listening , prolonged engagement and immersion techniques , as well as member - checking . moreover , we documented and kept a record regarding all of our analytic activities for the purpose of dependability . to ensure dependability we employed the triangulation technique . in triangulation , we collected the study data by using both the interview and the observation methods . to ensure the confirmability of the study findings , we employed the peer - check method . finally , we recruited a maximum variation sample to improve the transferability of the study findings . the study participants main concern was being non - professional in clinical judgment development . in response to this concern , they were struggling for becoming professional. this was the study s core category encompassing and linking all the other categories . when nurses were supported professionally , they were able to develop their professional clinical judgment . however , in case of growing presence of non professional factors , they were unable to openly practice their clinical judgment skills ( figure 1 ) . the properties or sub - categories of the study core category were striving for gaining professional autonomy , striving for integrating clinical judgment skills , scrambling to make effective educational interventions , and striving for professional and inter professional collaboration ( table 3 ) . our participating nurses were willing to make independent nursing interventions , practice an independent profession , and create a distinctive professional identity . one of their strategies was to develop a specialized curriculum both for the theoretical and clinical nursing education . they believed that such a curriculum could help them make independent clinical judgments and hence , gain autonomy . a nurse said , after completing specialized trainings in intensive care , i acquired better clinical judgment skills and now i can make more accurate clinical judgments . nurses also noted that gaining more autonomy from medicine , in terms of nursing interventions , would help them make independent clinical judgments . accordingly , they had adopted strategies such as providing patient care based on nursing models and theories as well as clinical practice guidelines to enhance their autonomy . a practicing nurse said , providing care to patients based on orem', ""in spanish by the same trained facilitator . to ensure a sizeable treatment dosage , the intervention involved a series of 12 ( 90 min ) weekly group sessions . the intervention was based on a best practice program developed by the national latino children 's institute ( nlci ) . participants were randomly assigned to small groups ( of 68 parent - child dyads ) that met as a group throughout the study period . at each session , participants were assigned small group activities to practice the skills they needed to apply the information taught ( e.g. , how to choose appropriate portion sizes ; how to be active with children ; how to monitor screen time ) . leadership roles were rotated through the group with the intention of increasing perceptions of group cohesion . to guard against differential drop out between intervention and control groups , we offered a brief school readiness program as an alternative to the active intervention . participants met in groups of 812 at 3 times for 60 minutes over the 12-week study period .

group b , mice that received pz 2 h before ir ; group c , mice that received pz 2 h after ir ( n=3/group ) . the mice were irradiated with a total body irradiation ( tbi ) of 15 gy in a single fraction . three days after radiation , the mice were sacrificed by injection of pentobarbital ( 200 mg / kg ) in the abdominal cavity , and the duodenum , jejunum and ileum were removed , fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h&e ) . surviving crypts with 10 cells for each cross - section were counted using microscopy . in the subsequent studies , based on the results , the mice were divided into two groups : mice that received oral administration of pz 2 h prior to ir [ pz ( + ) group ] and mice that were treated with drinking water without pz [ pz ( ) group ]', 'reported to localize to the lower areas in each crypt ( 12 ) . it was revealed that radiation induced apoptosis in the low positions from the base of the crypt axis , which was reduced following pz treatment . in addition , the present study also demonstrated the radioprotective effect of pz in the established - intestinal crypt stem cell assay . according to these results , pz protects the intestinal stem cells from cell death caused by ir and can reduce gastrointestinal toxicity associated with radiotherapy . cytoprotection of radioprotectants can include joint binding between the tumor cells and normal cells , since reactive oxygen species are believed to serve a significant role in radiotherapy delivered by photons . there is , however , little data of the negative effects of pz use for tumor control and the survival outcomes of the patients who received pz as a supportive treatment have been poorly understood . however , no direct evidence has suggested that the use of pz can lead to inferior tumor outcomes in patients with malignancies ( 8,9 ) . watanabe et al ( 8) reported that the initial responses of tumors to radiotherapy were not affected by the pz intake in a randomized clinical trial . in addition , our previous study recently reported that patients who received a pz - containing rinse showed no inferior survival outcomes compared with those that did not received pz in a retrospective study ( 9 ) . the present study administered pz 2 h prior to ir in order to distribute pz to whole intestine , according to the findings from our preliminary data . in addition , myagmarjalbuu et al ( 13 ) have reported the gastrointestinal transit time was 2 h in mice . it has been previously reported that pz causes its pharmacological effect by adhesion to damaged mucosa ( 4,6 ) . however , the time between the administration of pz and ir can increase the serum zinc concentration ( 12 ) . therefore , further studies to determine the mechanism of the radioprotective effects of pz are required . in conclusion ,']"
"What is currently the treatment of choice for endocrine malignancies such as thyroid, adrenal, and ovary tumors?",Surgery,"Surgery is currently the treatment of choice for endocrine malignancies such as thyroid, adrenal, and ovary tumors.","['endocrine malignancies , including carcinomas of the thyroid , adrenal , and ovary , are relatively rare tumors deriving from cells present in endocrine glands . surgery is currently the treatment of choice for these tumors and is often successful in early stages of disease . however , this therapeutic approach for the advanced tumors remains unsatisfactory and is associated with poor prognosis . thus , a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the critical intracellular networks underlying endocrine oncogenesis may help in discovering new targets that could represent promising therapeutic options for these malignancies . as specific pituitary tropins control the trophism and function of specific endocrine glands , it is tempting to speculate about a possible role for these pituitary hormones in endocrine glands tumorigenesis . however , this assumption is controversial as other signaling effectors , including the igf system , have often a major role in endocrine tumorigenesis . this paper covers the recent molecular advances in this field focusing on the role of the igf system in endocrine tumorigenesis with particular attention on the endocrine cancers best characterized until now ( i.e. , thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian tumors ) . several molecular alterations associated with thyroid tumorigenesis have been identified and often converge into the activation of mapk ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) and pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ) signaling pathways . its mitogenic actions are mainly mediated by camp , which in turn activates protein kinase a ( pka ) dependent and independent pathways . activating mutations of the tsh receptor ( tshr ) or of the gene encoding the gs subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein that couples tshr to adenylyl cyclase ( gsp ) have been described in 30% of autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas while they are rare in thyroid carcinomas [ 2 , 3 ] . tsh , however , has a well - known promoting role for thyroid cancer metastases , and tsh suppressive therapy with l - thyroxine is a well - established therapy in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer . to exert its maximal mitogenic effects studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] . tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin', 'had longer progression - free survival than nonusers , despite receiving similar treatment for ovarian cancer . a close relationship is now established between the use of metformin and progression , survival , and chemosensitivity of eoc [ 237240 ] ( table 2 ) . recently , a phase ii clinical trial ( nct01579812 ) started to establish the potential role of metformin as anticancer stem cell agent in eoc patients . the primary objective of this study is to determine if metformin , administered as the time of traditional adjuvant chemotherapy to women with advanced eoc , will improve recurrence - free survival at 18 months compared to controls ( table 2 ) . advanced endocrine tumors are characterized by poor prognosis and resistance to the common dna - damaging chemotherapies or radiotherapy . most extensively characterized endocrine malignancies include thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian cancers . in these tumors , a crosstalk between the igf system and the pituitary hormones specific for each endocrine gland has been recognized and seems to exert a role in the tumorigenesis process . recently , the risk of certain malignancies , including endocrine related cancers , has been found 2 - 3-fold increased in obese and t2 dm patients . insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia , typical features of both obesity and diabetes , are the major candidates for cancer risk and are also associated with poor cancer prognosis and resistance to conventional and targeted anticancer therapies . multiple alterations in the igf system as well as association with high circulating levels of insulin / igfs have been reported by several studies for these three endocrine cancer histotypes . however , the potential role of the igf system as therapeutical target in these tumors has being only recently evaluated and few clinical trials are currently ongoing . today the therapeutical strategies proposed to overcome igf axis alterations in these malignancies include igf - ir blocking antibodies , igf - ir / ir tyrosine - kinase inhibitors , and insulin sensitizers . so far , preclinical results obtained with the first two classes of drugs mentioned above have shown promising hopes although the results are not conclusive and no complete responses have been reported . furthermore , like in other malignancies , the development of intrinsic and adaptative resistance to igf axis blockage could occur . aberrant ir expression , particularly ir', 'first time by reincke et al . , who observed a proliferative effect of insulin on adrenal cancer cells without effect on cortisol synthesis . however , a causative role of adrenal incidentalomas for metabolic syndrome can not be excluded , as some patients show a slight hypercortisolism that may contribute to the insulin resistance . in fact , surgical tumor resection may revert or ameliorate these metabolic alterations . regarding the link between hyperinsulinemia and malignant adrenal tumors , scanty data are present in the literature so far . human thyroid carcinomas derived from the thyroid follicular cells ( tfcs ) include a variety of histotypes ranging from well - differentiated ( papillary and follicular ) to undifferentiated ( anaplastic ) cancers . altogether , they represent approximately 1% ( 3% in women ) of all human cancers [ 154 , 155 ] . well - differentiated thyroid carcinomas account for approximately 90% of all thyroid cancers . they retain a variable degree of tsh responsiveness and have a mortality rate of approximately 10% . poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas account for only approximately 10% of all thyroid cancers ; they have weak or no tsh responsiveness and have a mortality rate ranging from 50% to 100% [ 48 , 156 ] . as previously mentioned , the igf - i system plays an important role in regulating normal growth and development in the thyroid [ 6 , 9 ] and appears also to be involved in thyroid tumorigenesis . the coexpression of igf - i and its cognate receptor , igf - ir , has been documented by various studies in both cultured thyroid cells and tissue specimens . in particular , cultured human and ovine thyrocytes are able to release igf - i in the culture media [ 157 , 158 ] . also , thyroid adenoma cell lines synthesize igf - i , which stimulates cell growth by autocrine mechanisms . immunoreactive igf - i and igfbps were also found in the extracts of normal and nodular thyroid tissue specimens obtained at surgery from patients with nontoxic goiter [ 160162 ] ( table 1 ) . functional igf - ir is usually expressed at high levels in thyroid cancer cells . in sw579 thyroid carcinoma cells igf - i induced angiogenic activity via increased synthesis of hif-1 transcription factor and consequent stimulation of vascular endothelial growth', 'to investigate the possible role of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in endocrine tumors . at this regard , several case - control and prospective studies have found a strong positive association between overweight / obesity and thyroid cancer risk [ 128137 ] , although the data are not entirely consistent [ 138145 ] . the exact nature of the relationship between body mass index ( bmi ) and thyroid cancer incidence remains still unclear . besides the high circulating levels of insulin present in overweight / obese patients , other potential mechanisms may include increased levels of inflammatory adipokines . in addition , although obesity is associated with poor prognosis for several malignancies , this relationship has not been reported for thyroid cancer . in partial support with the finding that hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are risk factors for thyroid cancer , studies conducted in t2 dm patients have shown that higher fasting glucose levels are associated with increased thyroid cancer risk [ 144 , 147 ] . however , also for this association conflicting results have been obtained . concerning the association between hyperinsulinemia / insulin resistance and ovarian cancer risk , several lines of evidence suggest that women affected by polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) , a condition associated with insulin - resistance , are more likely to develop ovarian cancer ( or , 2.5 ; 95% ci 1.085.89 ) . furthermore , a meta - analysis of ten cohort studies has shown that overweight and obesity are associated with higher ovarian cancer mortality ( or , 1.6 ; 95% ci 1.12.34 ) and that , among patients with advanced ovarian cancer , premorbid obesity is associated with worse prognosis ( or , 1.5 ; 95% ci 1.091.93 ) . however , other studies have not supported these results , suggesting that further investigation is needed to firmly establish the association between ovarian cancer and insulin resistance . finally , it has been suggested that adrenal incidentalomas , usually benign tumors , might be related to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance . this hypothesis was postulated for the first time by reincke et al . , who observed a proliferative effect of insulin on adrenal cancer cells without effect on cortisol synthesis . however , a causative role of adrenal incidentalomas for metabolic syndrome can not be excluded , as some patients show a slight hypercortisolism that may', 'classes of drugs mentioned above have shown promising hopes although the results are not conclusive and no complete responses have been reported . furthermore , like in other malignancies , the development of intrinsic and adaptative resistance to igf axis blockage could occur . aberrant ir expression , particularly ir - a isoform , as well as hr - a formation and enhanced igf - ii autocrine production are very common alterations in endocrine cancers and could mediate the resistance to igf - ir blocking drugs . furthermore , insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are side effects of these drugs and may contribute to ir - a overactivation . new approaches aimed at specifically and safely targeting ir - a activation and/or disrupting the autocrine igf - ii / ir - a loop are urgently needed . in light of lines of evidence of association of endocrine cancers risk and hyperinsulinemia , insulin - sensitizers , such as metformin , hold promise as measures useful in cancer prevention .']"
What role does TSH have in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer after surgery?,TSH suppressive therapy with l-thyroxine is well-established in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer.,TSH has a promoting role in thyroid cancer metastases and TSH suppressive therapy with l-thyroxine is a well-established therapy in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer.,"['overall the prognosis in patients with differentiated thyroid cancers ( dtc ) is good . with appropriate treatment , the majority of these patients get cured except in patients with metastasis where the prognosis is worse [ 2 , 3 ] . management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer involves total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iremnant ablation ( rra ) , except in patients with intrathyroidal tumor 1 cm in size [ 4 , 5 ] . the rra may also be avoided in low risk well - differentiated thyroid cancer with postsurgical stimulated thyroglobulin ( stg ) < 1 ng / ml , an approach not yet approved by american thyroid association ( ata ) [ 68 ] . the theoretical goals of adjuvant ablation are ( a ) to destroy any residual microscopic disease , ( b ) to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic whole body iodine scan ( wbis ) and specificity of serum thyroglobulin ( tg ) which facilitates follow - up and early detection of recurrence or metastatic disease , and ( c ) to use postablative wbis which is more sensitive than diagnostic wbis for detection of nodal or distant functioning metastases . according to ata guidelines , stg and neck ultrasound with or without diagnostic wbis should be done 612 months after rra in these patients to see the presence or absence of disease . an area of ongoing controversy is the optimal dose of rai required to successfully ablate remnant tissue after total or near - total thyroidectomy with a single administration in low risk group . this can be achieved by either dosimetry method introduced by benua et al . or by fixed empiric activity of rai . , about 30,000 rad ( 300 gy ) radiation dose to thyroid bed was required for successful ablation and bal cs and padhy found 50 mci ( 1850 mbq ) of rai to deliver this required dose to thyroid bed after total thyroidectomy [ 11 , 12 ] . however , due to cumbersomeness of dosimetry method , the majority of treating physicians have adopted fixed empiric activity of rai ( 30200 mci or 11107400 mbq ) with no consensus about adequate ablative dose in low risk patients . due to these variable results , there has been lack of consensus among various thyroid organizations on the optimum rai dose for remnant ablation in', ""in the management of patients with dtc . thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein with molecular weight of 660,000 daltons containing > 3000 amino acids . it is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum of thyroid follicular cells and stored in the golgi apparatus to be secreted in thyroid follicular lumen . tsh stimulation leads to intracellular reuptake of thyroglobulin and its proteolytic degradation into active forms of thyroid hormones , that is , triiodothyronine and thyroxine . initially tg was thought to exist in the thyroid gland only but in 1961 its presence was demonstrated in the peripheral circulation too as a byproduct of thyroid hormone synthesis . in healthy individuals , small amount of tg is released physiologically into the circulation but in dtc it is actively released into circulation . as tg is actively released into circulation by dtc , therefore its level in circulation following total thyroidectomy is an established method of detecting recurrent or persistent disease particularly when performed after thyroxine withdrawal or recombinant tsh administration [ 2226 ] . measurement of serum tg becomes an important parameter for residual or recurrent disease in the follow - up of patients with dtc following total thyroidectomy and rra [ 4 , 23 , 24 ] . predicting the outcome of ablation in patients with dtc is important as this can help make appropriate decisions for patient 's management . previous studies have focused on stg only as a laboratory parameter for predicting the ablation outcome [ 16 , 27 ] . a recent retrospective study conducted on 133 patients revealed that a preablation stg < 8.55 ug / l predicted disease remission after 1824 months of rra with sensitivity of 88% , specificity of 72% , positive predictive value ( ppv ) of 47% , and negative predictive value ( npv ) of 95% . another study conducted on 96 patients in brazil found that patients with stg levels < 18 ng / ml before rra had 5.89 times greater chance of successful ablation compared to those with stg > 18 ng / ml ( p < 0.0001 ) with sensitivity of 71.4% , specificity of 70.2% , ppv of 71.4% , and npv of 70.2% . another recent study conducted in china showed that in patients with dtc who underwent total thyroidectomy , stg and its ratio with tsh before rra might be considered as predictive markers"", 'endocrine malignancies , including carcinomas of the thyroid , adrenal , and ovary , are relatively rare tumors deriving from cells present in endocrine glands . surgery is currently the treatment of choice for these tumors and is often successful in early stages of disease . however , this therapeutic approach for the advanced tumors remains unsatisfactory and is associated with poor prognosis . thus , a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the critical intracellular networks underlying endocrine oncogenesis may help in discovering new targets that could represent promising therapeutic options for these malignancies . as specific pituitary tropins control the trophism and function of specific endocrine glands , it is tempting to speculate about a possible role for these pituitary hormones in endocrine glands tumorigenesis . however , this assumption is controversial as other signaling effectors , including the igf system , have often a major role in endocrine tumorigenesis . this paper covers the recent molecular advances in this field focusing on the role of the igf system in endocrine tumorigenesis with particular attention on the endocrine cancers best characterized until now ( i.e. , thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian tumors ) . several molecular alterations associated with thyroid tumorigenesis have been identified and often converge into the activation of mapk ( mitogen -

known promoting role for thyroid cancer metastases , and tsh suppressive therapy with l - thyroxine is a well - established therapy in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer . to exert its maximal mitogenic effects studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] . tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin', ') with sensitivity of 71.4% , specificity of 70.2% , ppv of 71.4% , and npv of 70.2% . another recent study conducted in china showed that in patients with dtc who underwent total thyroidectomy , stg and its ratio with tsh before rra might be considered as predictive markers for metastasis . we used diagnostic wbis as an exclusion criterion due to its low impact on the decision to ablate and because of concerns over i induced stunning of normal thyroid remnants and distant metastases from thyroid cancer . this is first attempt to assess the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome , which was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome than stg . in this study , factors such as age , gender , type of tumor , size of tumor , and capsular invasion were not found to be significantly associated with rra outcome , while stg levels are significantly associated , a finding which is consistent with other studies [ 1 , 2731 ] . important finding of our study is association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome . we found that stg / tsh ratio had stronger association with ablation outcome than stg . as stg / tsh ratio was found to be significantly associated with ablation outcome ; therefore , it can help us in predicting the success of rra and we hypothesized that it might also help in adjusting the dose of i. this adjustment in the dose of iremnant ablative dose might be very important particularly in low risk dtc where there is still no consensus on optimal dose . cutoff value of 18 ng / ml for stg from our study is consistent with other studies from brazil , but our sensitivity and specificity are higher than those reported earlier for cutoff value of 18 ng / ml . since no cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio was available ; therefore , we also determined cutoff value for stg / tsh ratio , that is , 0.35 for predicting ablation outcome . these cutoff values for stg and stg / tsh ratio in our study have high sensitivity and specificity in predicting the outcome . this study is one of its kinds , investigating the association of stg / tsh ratio with ablation outcome in patients with dtc . we found that patients', 'its maximal mitogenic effects studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] . tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin or igf - i , which can thus be qualified as the only genuine mitogens . in fact , the protumorigenic effects of tsh are irrelevant in the absence of growth factors , but they are greatly potentiated by the presence of insulin or igf - i at physiological concentrations [ 5 , 8 ] . furthermore , we have recently reported a key role of the igf system in the biology of follicular thyroid progenitor / stem cells . insulin / igf - i signaling pathways are important also in the regulation of thyroid - specific genes transcription , including the tsh receptor , thyroglobulin ( tg ) , and thyroperoxidase ( tpo ) [ 11 , 12 ] . gene expression of both tg and tpo is mediated predominantly by thyroid transcription factor-2 ( ttf-2 ) , a thyroid - specific transcription factor that binds to the promoter of both genes [ 15 , 16 ] and is stimulated by both the camp and the insulin / igf - i pathways , which may have additive effects . regarding the adrenocortical cancers , their molecular pathogenesis is still incompletely understood . in contrast to thyroid carcinomas , the camp / pka pathway seems to be less involved in the development of these tumors . although pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) stimulates adrenal function by inducing steroidogenic enzymes and increases adrenal gland weight , the proliferative action of acth for adrenal tumors has been questioned , and opposite effects , under defined cell culture conditions , have been reported . in vitro inhibition of adrenal cell proliferation by physiological acth concentrations has been reported by several groups [ 1821 ] . in support of the growth - inhibiting effect of acth , no activating mutations of the acth receptor have been found in benign or malignant adrenocortical tumors [ 22 , 23 ] . conversely , allelic loss of the acth receptor gene has been reported in a subset of sporadic benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors where it was associated with undifferentiated phenotype and worse prognosis . these']"
Which signaling pathways are often activated due to molecular alterations associated with thyroid tumorigenesis?,MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) signaling pathways.,The signaling pathways that are often activated due to molecular alterations associated with thyroid tumorigenesis are the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) signaling pathways.,"['. these substrates , in turn , proteins for kinases and adaptors , such as pi3k , syp , fyn , nck , and grb2 , which trigger the activation of downstream kinase cascades . irs proteins are also involved in the crosstalk with other signaling pathways , including those coming from other growth factors , cytokines , and integrins . the two main signaling pathways downstream to ir and igf - ir include the mitogen - activated protein kinases cascade ( mapks ) , which involves the sequential activation of a cascade of serine / threonine protein kinases with a key role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and gene expression and the pi3k signaling pathway , which mediates metabolic actions but also stimulates cell growth and survival . both mapk and pi3k pathways enhance protein synthesis through mtor activation and trigger antiapoptotic effects through the phosphorylation and inactivation of bad . molecular alterations ( mutational and nonmutational ) in both pi3k and mapk have been reported in several malignancies including those from thyroid , ovary , and adrenal glands . conditional or constitutive deregulation of mapk and pi3k cascades is a common event in thyroid cancer and may play a pathogenetic role in this tumor . indeed , deregulated activation of the mapk cascade via mutations and/or rearrangements in ret , ras , and braf genes occurs in ~70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas ( the most common subtype of thyroid cancers ) [ 6668 ] . thyroid carcinomas also show mutations in pi3k signaling effectors such as pten and phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( pik3ca ) . pten is downregulated in ~37% of well - differentiated thyroid carcinomas and downregulated or lost in > 50% of highly malignant thyroid cancers ; point mutations or copy number changes in pik3ca are found in ~23% of anaplastic thyroid cancers where they can coexist with either ras or braf mutations . in adrenal cancer , pathway analysis for the genomic regions associated with poor prognosis has shown deletions of genes that negatively regulate the activation of erk1/2 and loss of pten gene . yet , several reports have identified activating ras mutations [ 72 , 73 ] , while only two papers have analyzed mutations in braf gene and found that their prevalence is low [ 74 , 75 ] . although functional studies are needed to better characterize', 'endocrine malignancies , including carcinomas of the thyroid , adrenal , and ovary , are relatively rare tumors deriving from cells present in endocrine glands . surgery is currently the treatment of choice for these tumors and is often successful in early stages of disease . however , this therapeutic approach for the advanced tumors remains unsatisfactory and is associated with poor prognosis . thus , a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the critical intracellular networks underlying endocrine oncogenesis may help in discovering new targets that could represent promising therapeutic options for these malignancies . as specific pituitary tropins control the trophism and function of specific endocrine glands , it is tempting to speculate about a possible role for these pituitary hormones in endocrine glands tumorigenesis . however , this assumption is controversial as other signaling effectors , including the igf system , have often a major role in endocrine tumorigenesis . this paper covers the recent molecular advances in this field focusing on the role of the igf system in endocrine tumorigenesis with particular attention on the endocrine cancers best characterized until now ( i.e. , thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian tumors ) . several molecular alterations associated with thyroid tumorigenesis have been identified and often converge into the activation of mapk ( mitogen -

known promoting role for thyroid cancer metastases , and tsh suppressive therapy with l - thyroxine is a well - established therapy in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer . to exert its maximal mitogenic effects studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] . tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin', 'of pten gene . yet , several reports have identified activating ras mutations [ 72 , 73 ] , while only two papers have analyzed mutations in braf gene and found that their prevalence is low [ 74 , 75 ] . although functional studies are needed to better characterize the effect of these mutations in adrenocortical tumors , it is possible that deregulation in the mapk pathway may significantly contribute to aggressive phenotypes . in ovarian cancer , mutually exclusive mutations of kras and braf have been described in about 3050% of low - grade tumors [ 7679 ] , while they are rare in high - grade tumors . ras mutations may promote ovarian tumorigenesis not only through mapk but also via the interaction with the pi3k / akt pathway . in ovarian cancers pi3k activation , occurring via either pik3ca gene amplification / mutations or pten protein loss , has been reported by several studies [ 8083 ] with the highest frequency in most malignant histotypes . in the context of the three endocrine tumors mentioned above , the dysregulation of the igf system may represent one nonmutational mechanism activating mapk and pi3k signaling cascades . the increased igf - ir - mediated activation of mapk / pi3k signaling may , in turn , induce igf - ir and/or its ligands expression and reduce the expression of igfbp-3 [ 8587 ] . this close relationship between the igf system and mapk / pi3k - mediated signals may contribute to cancer development , progression , invasion , and aggressive behavior . indeed , via pi3k / akt / pten and erk dependent mechanisms [ 8890 ] , igfs control several cycle checkpoints , in particular the g0-g1 transition , increasing cyclin d1 and cdk4 gene expression and down - regulating the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor ( cdki ) p27 . moreover , through the same pathways , igfs regulate cell invasion and tumor - dependent angiogenesis modulating the expression of molecular mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling and degradation including type iv collagenases , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( mmp-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( mmp-9 ) , and the membrane type 1 mmp ( mmp-14 ) [ 91 , 92 ] . these enzymes play an important role in malignant progression and metastatic spread of solid tumors , including endocrine ones . mmps expression has been found to be', 'its maximal mitogenic effects studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] . tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin or igf - i , which can thus be qualified as the only genuine mitogens . in fact , the protumorigenic effects of tsh are irrelevant in the absence of growth factors , but they are greatly potentiated by the presence of insulin or igf - i at physiological concentrations [ 5 , 8 ] . furthermore , we have recently reported a key role of the igf system in the biology of follicular thyroid progenitor / stem cells . insulin / igf - i signaling pathways are important also in the regulation of thyroid - specific genes transcription , including the tsh receptor , thyroglobulin ( tg ) , and thyroperoxidase ( tpo ) [ 11 , 12 ] . gene expression of both tg and tpo is mediated predominantly by thyroid transcription factor-2 ( ttf-2 ) , a thyroid - specific transcription factor that binds to the promoter of both genes [ 15 , 16 ] and is stimulated by both the camp and the insulin / igf - i pathways , which may have additive effects . regarding the adrenocortical cancers , their molecular pathogenesis is still incompletely understood . in contrast to thyroid carcinomas , the camp / pka pathway seems to be less involved in the development of these tumors . although pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) stimulates adrenal function by inducing steroidogenic enzymes and increases adrenal gland weight , the proliferative action of acth for adrenal tumors has been questioned , and opposite effects , under defined cell culture conditions , have been reported . in vitro inhibition of adrenal cell proliferation by physiological acth concentrations has been reported by several groups [ 1821 ] . in support of the growth - inhibiting effect of acth , no activating mutations of the acth receptor have been found in benign or malignant adrenocortical tumors [ 22 , 23 ] . conversely , allelic loss of the acth receptor gene has been reported in a subset of sporadic benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors where it was associated with undifferentiated phenotype and worse prognosis . these', ') and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( mmp-9 ) , and the membrane type 1 mmp ( mmp-14 ) [ 91 , 92 ] . these enzymes play an important role in malignant progression and metastatic spread of solid tumors , including endocrine ones . mmps expression has been found to be elevated in papillary thyroid cancer as compared with normal thyroid tissue [ 93 , 94 ] . a strong mmp2 expression has been also found in malignant adrenal tumors and considered an unfavorable prognostic factor . in ovarian cancers , mmps are frequently overexpressed and appear to be an early event of ovarian tumorigenesis suggesting a role of these enzymes in ovarian tumor initiation and not only in tumor progression and invasion . relevant crosstalks between the igf system and other signaling pathways also include the involvement of the janus kinase ( jak)-1/2 mediated signaling and the activation of transcription proteins stat . in particular , stat-3 may be required for the maintenance of transforming activity of igf - ir . igf - i is able to activate stat-3 , but not stat-5 , and this activation is probably mediated by jak proteins . these mechanisms have been demonstrated in several models , and they may also occur in endocrine cancers , where both stat and igf signaling play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasization . indeed , the stat-3 pathway is significantly upregulated in metastatic thyroid papillary cancers , suggesting a potential role for activated stat-3 in lymphatic metastases . yet , in both ovarian and adrenal cancers a role for stat signaling in invasion and cancer prognosis has been also identified [ 99 , 100 ] . other molecules interacting with the igf system and involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid , adrenal , and ovarian cancers include the tumor suppressor p53 . inactivating mutations of p53 gene occur in 10% , 47% , and 25% of thyroid , ovary , and adrenal sporadic carcinomas [ 101 , 102 ] , respectively . however , in all these tumors , also when not mutated , p53 activity may be inhibited by other mechanisms among which are an unbalanced expression of isoforms with a dominant negative function , the interaction with mdm2 , and the cooperation with other members of the p53 family such as tap63 , tap73 , and their dominant negative variants ( np63 and']"
What is the major function of the IGF-IIR (insulin-like growth factor II receptor)?,"The major function of the IGF-IIR is to induce internalization and degradation of IGF-II, thus modulating its extracellular levels.","The major function of the IGF-IIR (insulin-like growth factor II receptor) is to induce internalization and degradation of IGF-II, thus modulating its extracellular levels.","['and ir - b ) generated by alternative splicing of the ir gene with the exclusion ( ir - a ) or inclusion ( ir - b ) of 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 . the ir and the igf - ir have highly homologous structure , but different functions . given the high degree of homology , ir and igf - ir can heterodimerize leading to the formation of insulin / igf - i hybrid receptors ( hrs ) [ 33 , 34 ] . the igf - iir is a structurally distinct cell surface receptor whose major function is to induce internalization and degradation of igf - ii , thus modulating its extracellular levels . with regard to the ligands , insulin and igfs are related peptides , involved in metabolism as well as in growth and reproduction . insulin largely circulates in free form while more than 90% of igfs circulates bound to a complex family of igf - binding proteins ( igfbps ) , which regulate both the half - life and the biological effects of igfs . insulin and igfs bind with different affinity ir isoforms and igf - ir ( for more details see [ 3638 ] ) . recently , it has been reported that proinsulin , the insulin prohormone , which is characterized by low metabolic activity compared to mature insulin , is a selective ir - a ligand and may exert a putative role on growth and cell proliferation [ 39 , 40 ] . after ligand binding , phosphorylated receptors activate two main signaling pathways , the pi3k and the mapk cascade , involved in the regulation of cell metabolism , proliferation , and survival . although both the ir and igf - ir similarly activate these signaling networks , subtle differences exist in the recruitment of certain intracellular mediators and substrates between the two receptors , leading to the specific biological effects of each hormone . details regarding the igf system have been previously covered by several reviews to which we refer for more information [ 34 , 36 , 41 ] . since the igf system exerts a pivotal role in cell growth and homeostasis , it is not surprising that aberrant expression of receptors belonging to this system might be involved in cancer development , progression , and metastasis . the key role of igf', 'representing 60100% of total ir . data showing an increased relative abundance of ir - a are also available for certain endocrine cancers [ 38 , 48 , 54 ] . this observation is particularly interesting , as ir - a is mainly expressed in fetal life , while ir - b predominates in differentiated tissues [ 38 , 55 ] . furthermore , at variance with ir - b , which is a highly specific receptor for insulin , ir - a is a high - affinity receptor for insulin ; it shows intermediate affinity for igf - ii and low affinity for igf - i . although igf - ii is able to bind both to igf - ir and ir - a with similar affinity , its binding to ir - a has important implications . indeed , ir - a overexpression amplifies igf - ii effects in cancer cells and serves as a signaling diversification factor , as ir - a and igf - ir activate different downstream signals . because of the high homology between the ir and the igf - ir , in cells coexpressing irs and igf - ir hybrid ir / igf - ir receptors ( hrs ) may form [ 5860 ] . functionally , hrs are considered high - affinity igf - i - binding sites as they bind insulin with much lower affinity . in thyroid cancers large amounts of hrs have been measured both in well - differentiated papillary carcinomas and in poorly differentiated / undifferentiated carcinomas , probably as a consequence of increased ir expression . in these tumors , hrs account for 5075% of the total igf - i binding sites and mediate igf - i mitogenic signaling . ir and igf - ir share many similarities not only in their structures but also in their downstream signaling pathways . upon ligand binding , the intrinsic tyrosine kinases of both ir and igf - ir are activated and this results in the phosphorylation of several receptor substrates including the components of the irs family and shc . these substrates , in turn , proteins for kinases and adaptors , such as pi3k , syp , fyn , nck , and grb2 , which trigger the activation of downstream kinase cascades . irs proteins are also involved in the crosstalk with other signaling pathways , including those', ', 36 , 41 ] . since the igf system exerts a pivotal role in cell growth and homeostasis , it is not surprising that aberrant expression of receptors belonging to this system might be involved in cancer development , progression , and metastasis . the key role of igf - ir in oncogenic transformation derives from the studies showing that igf - ir null cells can not be transformed by several cellular or viral oncogenes , whereas they become susceptible to the oncogenic mediated transformation after the reintroduction of a functional igf - ir [ 42 , 43 ] . however , increased levels of igf - ir do not result in autonomous receptor signaling in the absence of igf ligand , while it can induce malignant transformation in presence of its specific ligands . similarly , in estrogen responsive breast cancer cell lines , growth response to insulin could be specifically inhibited by anti - ir but not anti - igf - ir blocking antibodies while it can be mimicked by an anti - ir stimulating antibody . these data are in agreement with studies indicating that ir - transfected cells acquire insulin - dependent malignant changes [ 46 , 47 ] and support the notion that ir may elicit mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects similar to igf - ir , contributing to cancer development and progression . the first direct evidence that ir may be overexpressed in cancer cells was reported by papa et al . in breast tumors . subsequent studies demonstrated that ir is also overexpressed in other human malignancies , including endocrine tumors , such as cancer of the thyroid , ovary , and adrenal glands [ 38 , 4850 ] . in most of these tumors , cell growth is dependent on ir activation by insulin , suggesting a mitogenic role of this hormone , although ir , isoform a , may also be activated by igf - ii [ 46 , 52 , 53 ] . both ir isoforms may be overexpressed in cancer , but usually ir - a is predominant , representing 60100% of total ir . data showing an increased relative abundance of ir - a are also available for certain endocrine cancers [ 38 , 48 , 54 ] . this observation is particularly interesting , as ir - a is mainly expressed in fetal life , while ir', 'hormones exert their effects interacting with their specific receptors . some ovarian cancers , especially those poorly differentiated , lose fsh receptor ( fshr ) expression . this observation suggests that fsh may be a growth - promoting factor important at early stages of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis , with some ovarian tumors losing their requirement for fsh later in tumor development . like adrenal and thyroid cancers , also in ovarian tumors igf - ii appears to increase proliferation and induce differentiation in granulosa cells via the igf - ir and synergizes with fsh to induce steroidogenesis as well as mitogenesis . this synergism likely involves igf - induced upregulation of the fshr [ 31 , 32 ] and/or the involvement of intracellular mechanisms leading to the activation of intracellular pathways ( i.e. , protein kinase c , camp , mapk , and pi3k ) . a schematic representation of the interplay between pituitary hormones and main signaling pathways of the igf system in thyroid , adrenal , and ovary cancers is shown in figure 1 . altogether , the lines of evidence reported in these three tumor histotypes suggest that , although the specific pituitary tropin exerts an important role in regulating the growth , differentiation , and function of the target endocrine gland , the interplay of pituitary hormones with other factors , such as the igf system , is crucial for deregulated cell proliferation and transformation . the igf system may represent , therefore , a promising therapeutical target for these tumors . in mammals the igf system includes four receptors ( the insulin receptor ( ir ) , the igf - i receptor ( igf - ir ) , the insulin - receptor - related receptor ( irr ) , and the mannose-6-phosphate / igf - ii receptor ( igf - iir ) ) , four ligands ( proinsulin , insulin , igf - i , and igf - ii ) , and six high - affinity binding proteins ( igfp-1 to 6 ) . the human ir exists in two isoforms ( ir - a and ir - b ) generated by alternative splicing of the ir gene with the exclusion ( ir - a ) or inclusion ( ir - b ) of 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 . the ir and the igf - ir have highly homologous structure , but', 'high ir / igf - ir content , blocking antibodies specific to these receptors substantially inhibited igf - i - induced cell growth . these data indicate that , in addition to igf - ir and ir - a , also ir / igf - ir hybrids may be a target in thyroid cancers ( table 1 ) . progenitor / stem cells are increasingly considered to be at the origin of most malignancies . therefore , we recently isolated progenitor / stem cells from both normal and cancer specimens and cultured them as thyrospheres , in order to study the igf system in this model . we found that igf - i and igf - ii are produced at high levels by all thyrospheres . however , the igf - i : igf - ii ratio was approximately 5 : 1 in normal thyrospheres whereas it was 1 : 1 in cancer thyrospheres . ir and igf - ir in human thyrospheres were markedly overexpressed and with a higher ir : igf - ir ratio as compared to primary cultures . the ir : igf - ir ratio was also higher in cancer than in normal thyrospheres . receptors ( ir and igf - ir ) and ligands ( igf - i and igf - ii ) , all expressed at high levels in thyrospheres , markedly decreased in differentiating cells . ir - a was the predominant isoform in thyrospheres , especially from cancer , while ir - b was predominant in differentiating cells . ir - a relative abundance was associated with characteristics of stemness and with cancer : it ranged from 65 to 86% in cancer thyrospheres , from 50 to 65% in normal thyrospheres , and from 40 to 45% in normal thyroid primary cultures or differentiated sphere - derived thyrocytes . the expression of ir , igf - ir , and their ligands was evaluated by quantitative real - time pcr . cancer thyrosphere growth was stimulated by insulin and igfs , while igf - ii was most potent in inducing cell renewal ( table 1 ) . considering the involvement of igf -

What are the two main signaling pathways activated by phosphorylated receptors after ligand binding in the context of insulin and IGF signaling?,The PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade.,The two main signaling pathways activated by phosphorylated receptors after ligand binding in the context of insulin and IGF signaling are the PI3K pathway and the MAPK pathway.,"['. these substrates , in turn , proteins for kinases and adaptors , such as pi3k , syp , fyn , nck , and grb2 , which trigger the activation of downstream kinase cascades . irs proteins are also involved in the crosstalk with other signaling pathways , including those coming from other growth factors , cytokines , and integrins . the two main signaling pathways downstream to ir and igf - ir include the mitogen - activated protein kinases cascade ( mapks ) , which involves the sequential activation of a cascade of serine / threonine protein kinases with a key role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and gene expression and the pi3k signaling pathway , which mediates metabolic actions but also stimulates cell growth and survival . both mapk and pi3k pathways enhance protein synthesis through mtor activation and trigger antiapoptotic effects through the phosphorylation and inactivation of bad . molecular alterations ( mutational and nonmutational ) in both pi3k and mapk have been reported in several malignancies including those from thyroid , ovary , and adrenal glands . conditional or constitutive deregulation of mapk and pi3k cascades is a common event in thyroid cancer and may play a pathogenetic role in this tumor . indeed , deregulated activation of the mapk cascade via mutations and/or rearrangements in ret , ras , and braf genes occurs in ~70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas ( the most common subtype of thyroid cancers ) [ 6668 ] . thyroid carcinomas also show mutations in pi3k signaling effectors such as pten and phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( pik3ca ) . pten is downregulated in ~37% of well - differentiated thyroid carcinomas and downregulated or lost in > 50% of highly malignant thyroid cancers ; point mutations or copy number changes in pik3ca are found in ~23% of anaplastic thyroid cancers where they can coexist with either ras or braf mutations . in adrenal cancer , pathway analysis for the genomic regions associated with poor prognosis has shown deletions of genes that negatively regulate the activation of erk1/2 and loss of pten gene . yet , several reports have identified activating ras mutations [ 72 , 73 ] , while only two papers have analyzed mutations in braf gene and found that their prevalence is low [ 74 , 75 ] . although functional studies are needed to better characterize', 'and ir - b ) generated by alternative splicing of the ir gene with the exclusion ( ir - a ) or inclusion ( ir - b ) of 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 . the ir and the igf - ir have highly homologous structure , but different functions . given the high degree of homology , ir and igf - ir can heterodimerize leading to the formation of insulin / igf - i hybrid receptors ( hrs ) [ 33 , 34 ] . the igf - iir is a structurally distinct cell surface receptor whose major function is to induce internalization and degradation of igf - ii , thus modulating its extracellular levels . with regard to the ligands , insulin and igfs are related peptides , involved in metabolism as well as in growth and reproduction . insulin largely circulates in free form while more than 90% of igfs circulates bound to a complex family of igf - binding proteins ( igfbps ) , which regulate both the half - life and the biological effects of igfs . insulin and igfs bind with different affinity ir isoforms and igf - ir ( for more details see [ 3638 ] ) . recently , it has been reported that proinsulin , the insulin prohormone , which is characterized by low metabolic activity compared to mature insulin , is a selective ir - a ligand and may exert a putative role on growth and cell proliferation [ 39 , 40 ] . after ligand binding , phosphorylated receptors activate two main signaling pathways , the pi3k and the mapk cascade , involved in the regulation of cell metabolism , proliferation , and survival . although both the ir and igf - ir similarly activate these signaling networks , subtle differences exist in the recruitment of certain intracellular mediators and substrates between the two receptors , leading to the specific biological effects of each hormone . details regarding the igf system have been previously covered by several reviews to which we refer for more information [ 34 , 36 , 41 ] . since the igf system exerts a pivotal role in cell growth and homeostasis , it is not surprising that aberrant expression of receptors belonging to this system might be involved in cancer development , progression , and metastasis . the key role of igf', 'representing 60100% of total ir . data showing an increased relative abundance of ir - a are also available for certain endocrine cancers [ 38 , 48 , 54 ] . this observation is particularly interesting , as ir - a is mainly expressed in fetal life , while ir - b predominates in differentiated tissues [ 38 , 55 ] . furthermore , at variance with ir - b , which is a highly specific receptor for insulin , ir - a is a high - affinity receptor for insulin ;

What is the major virulence factor of Haemophilus influenzae type b?,The Hib capsule composed of polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP).,The major virulence factor of Haemophilus influenzae type b is the Hib capsule.,"['before discovery of an effective vaccine , haemophilus influenzae type b ( hib ) was the most important cause of bacterial meningitis , otitis media , pneumonia , cellulitis , bacteremia , and septic arthritis in infants and children younger than five years ( 1 , 2 ) . it is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world , with as many as 3 million cases of serious disease occurring every year . the hib capsule is its major virulence factor , and is composed of a polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ( prp ) that can induce protective and effective immunity ( 3 ) . hib prp is a polymer of repeating monomeric units , structurally characterized as -d - ribose - d - ribitol - phosphate ( 4 , 5 ) . the first generation of vaccines for hib was licensed in the united states in 1985 , based on purified capsular polysaccharide ( 6 ) . this type of vaccine stimulates a t cell - independent immune response and prevents hib infections in children older than 2 years , but it does not protect infants ( 7 ) . since about 75% of hib infection cases occur in children younger than 2 years , second - generation hib vaccines , which induced t - cell dependent immune responses , were produced as prp - protein conjugates and licensed in the united states in 1987 ( 8) . the price of the conjugated prp vaccine is high ( 9 ) , and therefore a major challenge in hib vaccine production is to develop a cost - efficient vaccine . to enhance biomass and prp productions , most previous studies have focused on hib cultivation with respect to essential chemical , biochemical , and physical factors such as ph , dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , aeration , temperature , and agitation ( 10 - 12 ) . most of these studies employed single factors or multiple factors by changing one variable at a time , while keeping the others at a constant level . however , such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm )', ', such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm ) to examine the main and/or interactive effects of a factorial combination of ph , temperature , and agitation treatment factors on the growth of hib and biomass production . response surface methodology enabled the identification of optimum levels of growth factors in maximizing hib biomass , and more prp production as a direct result ( 10 , 13 ) . response surface methodology guides the plan of the experiments and the parsimonious analysis of data to gain a maximum amount of information most efficiently ( 14 , 15 ) . a strain of haemophilus influenzae type b , atcc 10211 , was used in all the experiments . the culture medium was prepared according to the method explained by maitre - wilmotte et al . it had 5 mg of -nad ( sigma , germany ) , 0.015 g of protoporphyrin ix ( sigma , germany ) , 20 g of glucose ( merck , germany ) , 5 g of dialyzed yeast extract ( sigma , germany ) , 70 mg of cysteine ( sigma , germany ) , 10 g of bactopepton ( difco , usa ) , 20 mg of tryptophan ( sigma , germany ) , 31.14 g of na2hpo4 .12h2o ( sigma , germany ) , 2.03 g of nah2po4.2h2o ( sigma , germany ) , 1 g of ( nh4)2so4 ( sigma , germany ) , 0.4 g of mgso4.7h2o ( sigma , germany ) , and 0.02 g of cacl2.2h2o ( sigma , germany ) . all material was dissolved in de - ionized water to a final volume of 1 l , and the medium was filtered in a 0.8 m ( millipore , canada ) membrane . fifty ml of the culture medium was distributed to a non - baffled 250 ml erlenmeyer and autoclaved at 121 c for 30 minutes . glucose , nad , and protoporphyrin were sterilized separately by filtration with 0.22 m ( millipore , canada ) membranes , and transferred to experimental flasks . the preparation of the working seed and inoculation of experimental culture flasks', 'children worldwide , as well as an important pathogen of the elderly and immune compromised ( bader and mckinsey 2005 ; ebbert and limper 2005 ; mejias et al 2005 ) the disease burden associated with rsv infection is considerable as rsv is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide having infection rates approaching 70%80% in the first year of life with many patients requiring hospitalization ( mccarthy and hall 2003 ; leung et al 2005 ) . unfortunately , despite five decades of research , no safe and effective rsv vaccine is available and few effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments are available . thus , there is a critical need for the development of novel tools and platforms to augment virus diagnosis and foundational studies required for development of disease intervention strategies . the surface topography of viruses lends to detection by antibodies , a feature that has been successfully used for bio - conjuagted np detection of rsv ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ; bentzen et al 2005 ) . rsv has two major surface proteins , ie , g and f proteins , that are primarily responsible for virus attachment and fusion , respectively ( tripp 2005 ) . both g and f proteins are recognized by the immune system as neutralizing antigens ; thus a majority of antibodies are directed toward these proteins ( tripp 2005 ) . the rsv f protein is more conserved than the g protein among rsv strains ( tripp 2005 ) , thus antibodies reactive to the f protein are ideal target developing bioconjugated nanoparticles . taking advantage of the composition - tunable emission of nps and their multivalent specificity when conjugated to monoclonal antibodies , we tested the ability of these bioconjugated nps to detect rsv infection in vitro and in vivo using in a single - step format . we show that bioconjugated nps can be used to rapidly and sensitively detect rsv infection in both cell lines and mice , and that the detection can be done in a single step format . this single - step format dramatically improves virus detection time , potentially saves costs , and reduces background staining that is currently associated with conventional virus detection methods . to develop bioconjugated nanoparticles to detect rsv infection , semiconductor cadmium telluride ( cdte ) quantum dots ( qds )', 'factor nfb and subsequent up - regulation of nfb - dependent expression of e - selectin ( fig . the oxidants produced in endothelial cells during sepsis also induce expression of tissue factor [ 30 , 60 ] . this transmembrane glycoprotein ( formerly known as thromboplastin ) because endothelial cells and monocytes do not express tissue factor under physiological conditions , there is no appreciable contact of cellular tissue factor with the circulating blood . however , these cells do express tissue factor when exposed to inflammatory cytokines and this response contributes to coagulopathy in sepsis . when tissue factor is exposed to blood , it forms a high - affinity complex with coagulation factors , leading to the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot . coagulation is activated rapidly after septic insult and results in diffuse microvascular clot formation that may disrupt blood flow in capillary beds [ 28 , 30 , 60 ] . nadph oxidase - derived oxidants also stimulate the activation of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) in endothelial cells . normally the hif-1 subunit has a short half - life because it is covalently modified by hif-1 prolylhydroxylase , which targets hif-1 for proteolysis by the ubiquitin - proteosome system . however , oxidants inhibit prolylhydroxylase activity and thereby allow hif-1 to dimerize with the hif-1 subunit . the dimerization activates hif-1 to translocate to the nucleus , bind dna and promote expression of inos and other inflammatory genes [ 6264 ] . sepsis is treated by controlling the source of infection , administering antimicrobial ( e.g. , antibiotic ) therapy , assuring hemodynamic support with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor drugs , inducing sedation or analgesia as needed ; and providing adequate nutrition . despite these interventions , approximately one - third of all patients with severe sepsis die before leaving hospital . therefore , the development of additional therapies is a research topic of urgent priority . this hypothesis is based on the observation that many patients with sepsis die of organ failure despite adequate arterial blood oxygenation and cardiac output [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] . further , survival is improved by treatments that improve microvascular function ( e.g. , antioxidants , inos deficiency , and tissue factor pathway inhibitor ) in animal models of polymicrobial sepsis [ 33 , 6770 ] . several potential', 'ml erlenmeyer and autoclaved at 121 c for 30 minutes . glucose , nad , and protoporphyrin were sterilized separately by filtration with 0.22 m ( millipore , canada ) membranes , and transferred to experimental flasks . the preparation of the working seed and inoculation of experimental culture flasks were done according to the methods explained by merritt et al .

What type of immune response is stimulated by the first generation of vaccines for Hib?,A T cell-independent immune response.,The first generation of vaccines for Hib stimulates a T cell-independent immune response.,"['before discovery of an effective vaccine , haemophilus influenzae type b ( hib ) was the most important cause of bacterial meningitis , otitis media , pneumonia , cellulitis , bacteremia , and septic arthritis in infants and children younger than five years ( 1 , 2 ) . it is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world , with as many as 3 million cases of serious disease occurring every year . the hib capsule is its major virulence factor , and is composed of a polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ( prp ) that can induce protective and effective immunity ( 3 ) . hib prp is a polymer of repeating monomeric units , structurally characterized as -d - ribose - d - ribitol - phosphate ( 4 , 5 ) . the first generation of vaccines for hib was licensed in the united states in 1985 , based on purified capsular polysaccharide ( 6 ) . this type of vaccine stimulates a t cell - independent immune response and prevents hib infections in children older than 2 years , but it does not protect infants ( 7 ) . since about 75% of hib infection cases occur in children younger than 2 years , second - generation hib vaccines , which induced t - cell dependent immune responses , were produced as prp - protein conjugates and licensed in the united states in 1987 ( 8) . the price of the conjugated prp vaccine is high ( 9 ) , and therefore a major challenge in hib vaccine production is to develop a cost - efficient vaccine . to enhance biomass and prp productions , most previous studies have focused on hib cultivation with respect to essential chemical , biochemical , and physical factors such as ph , dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , aeration , temperature , and agitation ( 10 - 12 ) . most of these studies employed single factors or multiple factors by changing one variable at a time , while keeping the others at a constant level . however , such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm )', 'h2 . in our present study all but one patient showed a higher avige than avigg ( avige / avigg ratio > 1 ; data not shown ) , a fact that does not rule out opposite findings if we would have available affinity studies with known allergens . whereas all immunoglobulin isotypes are known to be lower in cu+ than in gaa , a fact we could also confirm for specific igg in our study , avidities could also be interpreted when analysing the time interval between parasitism and obtaining of the serum sample . likewise , regression analysis showed that , in gaa , time interval was the main explaining factor for ige avidity . affinity is overall expected to rise in time after infection , but this probably applies to only a few relevant allergens or epitopes . a possible explanation for our results could be drawn from the correlation studies depicted in figures 2 and 3 . polyclonal stimulation after an acute parasitic episode leads to high immunoglobulin levels , and in the case of ige , most ige does not recognize anisakis proteins [ 2 , 13 ] . even if we only focus on specific ige production , a mixture of high - affinity and low - affinity antibodies is to be expected . as antibody levels continuously fall again after a peak at about one month , low - affinity ige antibodies seem here to turn up over high - affinity antibodies resulting in overall lower avidity . there is still controversy about the beneficial role of low - affinity ige antibodies . according to xiong et al . these can compete with high - affinity ige for binding to high - affinity ige receptors and prevent anaphylaxis in atopic allergy . otherwise this possibility has been stated unlikely because very high levels of ige are needed to adequately saturate ige receptors . also in this case we could speculate that , once a sensitization process has occurred , following continuous contact with anisakis proteins of other specificities than those leading to the allergic episode , leads to maintaining lower affinity antibodies . this would be an explanation to the fact that patients sensitized to anisakis do not react with acute type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in provocation tests with non viable anisakis larvae [ 28 , 29 ] . furthermore , blocking antibodies', 'ml erlenmeyer and autoclaved at 121 c for 30 minutes . glucose , nad , and protoporphyrin were sterilized separately by filtration with 0.22 m ( millipore , canada ) membranes , and transferred to experimental flasks . the preparation of the working seed and inoculation of experimental culture flasks were done according to the methods explained by merritt et al .

What was the issue with the first generation of Hib vaccines concerning infants?,"It did not protect infants, who are most at risk since about 75% of Hib infection cases occur in children younger than 2 years.",The first generation of Hib vaccines did not protect infants.,"['before discovery of an effective vaccine , haemophilus influenzae type b ( hib ) was the most important cause of bacterial meningitis , otitis media , pneumonia , cellulitis , bacteremia , and septic arthritis in infants and children younger than five years ( 1 , 2 ) . it is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world , with as many as 3 million cases of serious disease occurring every year . the hib capsule is its major virulence factor , and is composed of a polyribosyl ribitol phosphate ( prp ) that can induce protective and effective immunity ( 3 ) . hib prp is a polymer of repeating monomeric units , structurally characterized as -d - ribose - d - ribitol - phosphate ( 4 , 5 ) . the first generation of vaccines for hib was licensed in the united states in 1985 , based on purified capsular polysaccharide ( 6 ) . this type of vaccine stimulates a t cell - independent immune response and prevents hib infections in children older than 2 years , but it does not protect infants ( 7 ) . since about 75% of hib infection cases occur in children younger than 2 years , second - generation hib vaccines , which induced t - cell dependent immune responses , were produced as prp - protein conjugates and licensed in the united states in 1987 ( 8) . the price of the conjugated prp vaccine is high ( 9 ) , and therefore a major challenge in hib vaccine production is to develop a cost - efficient vaccine . to enhance biomass and prp productions , most previous studies have focused on hib cultivation with respect to essential chemical , biochemical , and physical factors such as ph , dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , aeration , temperature , and agitation ( 10 - 12 ) . most of these studies employed single factors or multiple factors by changing one variable at a time , while keeping the others at a constant level . however , such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm )', 'in 2006 , the world health organization ( who ) reported that out of the 130 million live births every year , 4 million die within the first four weeks of life . of these deaths , 99% occur in developing countries ( approximately half following difficult deliveries at home ) against 1% in developed countries . most of these deaths ( 30 - 40% ) are due to neonatal infections . according to the 2004 demographic health survey in cameroon , neonatal infections are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths , thus constituting a major public health problem . in cameroon and in most developing countries , a combination of three parenteral antibiotics - ampicillin , aminoside and a third generation cephalosporin which cover a broad spectrum of germs , is instituted to treat neonatal infections while awaiting culture and sensitivity tests . yet neonatal infections still claim the lives of many children in this setting . this study was aimed at determining the incidence and risk factors of neonatal bacterial infections , the clinical and bacteriological profile and sensitivity to antibiotics used , and the clinical outcomes in a referral mother and child hospital . the study was a prospective study in the neonatology unit of the yaounde gynaeco - obstetric and pediatric hospital , from the 18 november 2008 to 18 may 2009 . the study population consisted of all symptomatic neonates ( 0 to 28 days ) with a maternal history suggestive of infection admitted in this unit within the study period . patient selection was done in two phases : phase 1 : all the neonates , in -

What optimization method did the researchers use to determine the optimum levels of growth factors for Hib biomass production?,Response surface methodology (RSM) using a central composite design (CCD).,The researchers used a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and a Central Composite Design (CCD) as the optimization method to determine the optimum levels of growth factors for Hib biomass production.,"[', especially on the statistical optimization of physical and chemical factors affecting growth and bulk production of hib biomass . over the past years there has been only one published article using a reliable statistical method ( plackett - burman design ) for optimization of hib culture medium components ( 12 ) . nevertheless , takagi and her colleagues published several very valuable articles on improvement and characterization of hib prp production ( 9 , 10 , 13 , 17 ) . also we found that by using statistical methods like rsm and ccd to sketch an optimization plan , there will be a huge savings in the number and type of essential experiments , materials , time , depreciation of equipment and devices , human resources and specialists , and consumed energy , that will finally result in a lower overall price of the vaccine . hib biomass production was greatly influenced by ph and incubation temperature of cultured media . therefore , optimization of the growth factors to maximize hib production can lead to 1 ) increased bacterial biomass and prp productions , 2 ) lower vaccine prices , 3 ) vaccination of more susceptible populations , and 4 ) lower risk of hib infections . with reference to anova data ( table 3 ) , the ph of culture medium and temperature of incubation are very effective factors in the growth of hib ( p - value equal or < 0.0001 ) . takagi et al . ( 10 ) obtained about 4300 mg / l dcw of hib ( strain gb 3291 ) in a fermentor with overlay aeration , and 4900 mg / l dcw with 10% air saturated dot ( dissolved oxygen tension ) , without ph control , and proposed that hib biomass production is better at low dissolved oxygen if ph is not controlled . under our study s conditions , the experiments were carried out in shaking flasks without air - sparged and uncontrolled ph , and we obtained about 5471 mg / l dcw of hib biomass , after optimization of treatment factors by rsm . figure 2 and 3 illustrate the 3-d response surfaces that show the effects of temperature and ph . hib biomass production increased considerably when initial ph increased from 6 to 8.5 and temperature decreased to 35c . when initial ph was less than the', 'of treatment factors by rsm . figure 2 and 3 illustrate the 3-d response surfaces that show the effects of temperature and ph . hib biomass production increased considerably when initial ph increased from 6 to 8.5 and temperature decreased to 35c . when initial ph was less than the optimum point and tended towards 6 , and agitation had fallen toward minimum values ( about 100 ) , hib biomass production decreased parallel to decreasing temperature , from 39 to 35c . at higher values of agitation ( over 200 rpm ) , there was no significant difference between the amounts of hib biomass produced at temperatures from 35c to 39c . however , when the initial ph was 8.5 , decreasing incubation temperature from 39c to 35c led to substantially increased hib biomass . despite the extensive studies that have been done on hib , published studies on hib cultivation are rare ( 9 , 10 ) , especially on the statistical optimization of physical and chemical factors affecting growth and bulk production of hib biomass . over the past years there has been only one published article using a reliable statistical method ( plackett - burman design ) for optimization of hib culture medium components ( 12 ) . nevertheless , takagi and her colleagues published several very valuable articles on improvement and characterization of hib prp production ( 9 , 10 , 13 , 17 ) . also we found that by using statistical methods like rsm and ccd to sketch an optimization plan , there will be a huge savings in the number and type of essential experiments , materials , time , depreciation of equipment and devices , human resources and specialists , and consumed energy , that will finally result in a lower overall price of the vaccine . therefore , optimization of the growth factors to maximize hib production can lead to 1 ) increased bacterial biomass and prp productions , 2 ) lower vaccine prices , 3 ) vaccination of more susceptible populations , and 4 ) lower risk of hib infections .', ', such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm ) to examine the main and/or interactive effects of a factorial combination of ph , temperature , and agitation treatment factors on the growth of hib and biomass production . response surface methodology enabled the identification of optimum levels of growth factors in maximizing hib biomass , and more prp production as a direct result ( 10 , 13 ) . response surface methodology guides the plan of the experiments and the parsimonious analysis of data to gain a maximum amount of information most efficiently ( 14 , 15 ) . a strain of haemophilus influenzae type b , atcc 10211 , was used in all the experiments . the culture medium was prepared according to the method explained by maitre -

What are some of the common reasons for delayed tooth eruption mentioned in the article?,"Insufficient space, early loss of primary teeth with eventual closure of space, crowding of arches, rotation of tooth buds, and excessive fibrous tissue over an erupting tooth.","Insufficient space, early loss of primary teeth with eventual closure of space, crowding of arches, rotation of tooth buds, and excessive fibrous tissue over an erupting tooth.","['eruption is the axial or occlusal movement of the tooth from its developmental position within the jaw to its functional position in the occlusal plane . the common and important reasons attributed to delayed eruption are usually insufficient space , early loss of primary teeth with eventual closure of space , crowding of arches and rotation of tooth buds . excessive fibrous tissue over an erupting tooth is also one of the most common causes , with eruption cysts being relatively rare . complete lack of eruptive force can be the reason for unerupted tooth when the normal number of teeth is present radiographically , although this is debatable , since few workers have debunked this claim . syndromes , metabolic , and hormonal disorders are also other causes of multiple impacted permanent teeth . finally crowding and rotation of tooth buds can also lead to impacted teeth . the objective of the study is to increase awareness of cases of multiple unerupted teeth in which multiple etiologies need to be discussed and investigated . a 17-year - old male patient reported with a chief complaint of multiple missing teeth and compromized esthetics . he had no relevant family history and this was his first dental visit . on further enquiry the patient revealed that he had loss of deciduous teeth with no eruption of permanent teeth . on examination , the patient had multiple retained deciduous teeth with only the permanent maxillary central and lateral incisors , mandibular central incisors , right maxillary first molar and left mandibular first molar present . the incisal length of the maxillary central incisors appeared reduced ( partial eruption ) and the patient had a high arched palate [ figure 1 ] . high arched palate along with reduced incisal length is also visible the patient was advised opg , chest x - ray and skull x - ray . opg revealed the presence of impacted , unerupted , and missing permanent teeth [ figure 2 , table 1 ] . skull and chest x - rays did not reveal any other obvious deformities [ figure 3 ] . panaromic radiograph of patient showing retained deciduous teeth and multiple impacted permanent teeth missing , unerupted , and impacted teeth skull and chest xrays which do not reveal any obvious deformities the patient did not report for investigations and was unresponsive . multiple impactions', 'deformities [ figure 3 ] . panaromic radiograph of patient showing retained deciduous teeth and multiple impacted permanent teeth missing , unerupted , and impacted teeth skull and chest xrays which do not reveal any obvious deformities the patient did not report for investigations and was unresponsive . multiple impactions are seen rarely and are usually associated with systemic conditions . guided eruption of many teeth with the help of coordinated multidisciplinary management there are numerous eruption - regulating molecules having similar and overlapping functions , which ensures that even the absence of a single factor does not interrupt the event of eruption . but egf , egf - r , csf-1 , csf-1r , il-1 , il-1r , c - fos , nfb , mcp-1 , tgf-1 , pthrp , cbfa - l ( now called runx2 ) , opg , rank / rankl are the major tooth eruption molecules . stellate reticulum is the site for few molecules with the majority of the eruption molecules residing in the dental follicle . while most eruption defects are part of a genetic syndrome , they can also be nonfamilial , as in the case in primary failure of eruption ( pfe ) . in pfe localized failure of eruption of candidate genes for primary failure of eruption would be the molecules that function solely in the pre - eruptive phase and that are expressed in cells of the dental follicle and surrounding structures . hence , it is likely that genes like csf-1 , nfb , and c - fos are the genes responsible for the eruption defect . common reasons like lack of space , prolonged retention or early loss of deciduous tooth , abnormal position of tooth bud , presence of alveolar cleft , ankylosis , cystic or neoplastic formation , alveolar or dental trauma , and dilacerations of teeth falling into the localized category . the differential diagnoses in case of syndromes are cleidocranial dysostosis , gardners syndrome , gorlin sedano syndrome , and yunis varon syndrome . in the case of cleidocranial dysplasia the patients usually exhibit high - arched palate with prolonged retention of the deciduous teeth leading to subsequent delay in eruption of the deciduous teeth . though both the intraoral features were present in our case the abnormalities of skull and shoulder girdle along with multiple supernumerary impacted teeth were absent . gardner', ""exhibit high - arched palate with prolonged retention of the deciduous teeth leading to subsequent delay in eruption of the deciduous teeth . though both the intraoral features were present in our case the abnormalities of skull and shoulder girdle along with multiple supernumerary impacted teeth were absent . gardner 's syndrome that also presents with multiple impacted teeth was ruled out as associated signs like multiple epidermoid cysts and other lesions were absent . sedano syndrome represents as short hands , foot bones with short and straight collar bone along with multiple impacted teeth . features of yunis varon syndrome are agenesis or hypoplasia of clavicle , severe micrognathia , digital anomalies , hypodontia , spinal defects , and impacted teeth . both the syndromes presented with multiple impacted teeth but were ruled out from our case as other symptoms were not present . in the case of hormonal disorders hypothyroidism , hypoparathyroidism , and pseudo hypoparathyrodism are to be considered . estimation of t3 , t4 , and tsh is required for diagnosing hypothyrodism where there is low serum t4 and elevated tsh . evaluation of total serum calcium concentration and serum parathyroid hormone is required for hypoparathyrodism and pseudohypoparathyroidism . there is decrease of serum calcium in both and elevation of parathyroid hormone in pseudo hypoparathyroidism and decrease of hormone in hypoparathyrodism . metabolic disorders like vitamin d deficiency rickets are also associated with impacted teeth . in our case , failure of eruption could also be due to crowding of supernumerary teeth but in our case that was not observed . in this case , the medical and family histories along with extraoral examination were not suggestive of any syndrome or metabolic disorder . only a few cases of nonsyndrome multiple impacted teeth were reported.[913 ] in those studies the predominant explanation was that some physical barrier led to impaction and noneruption of teeth . duration and results of treatment in less frequent cases of multiple impactions is a major concern when compared to more frequent single impaction cases . multidisciplinary approach would be the appropriate choice as treatment involves esthetics , functional , and oral health problems . in case of unerupted teeth , orthodontic extrusions may be attempted . in view of the pathological potential of the impacted teeth , surgical removal is recommended . rehabilitation of the patient with fixed dentures needs to"", 'choice as treatment involves esthetics , functional , and oral health problems . in case of unerupted teeth , orthodontic extrusions may be attempted . in view of the pathological potential of the impacted teeth , surgical removal is recommended . rehabilitation of the patient with fixed dentures needs to be planned with the help of a prosthdontist and implantologist . obtaining stable results along with enhanced esthetics , oral health , and function would be the objective of the treatment . hypodontia and eruption problems are mainly focused on genes such as csf 1 , nfb , and c - fos . radiographs reveal the presence of multiple impacted teeth but additional investigations are needed to rule out systemic and metabolic conditions . a decision about the management since the patient was regrettably lost to follow - up , genetic , and other studies could not be performed . . therefore , an idiopathic case of multiple impacted teeth could be the only possible diagnosis , since the term idiopathic refers to unknown cause , which is the case in this particular scenario .', 'bone loss , spacing and extrusion of incisors . horizontal defect ( h ) around maxillary left central incisor .

observer variability we could exclude the risk for interobserver variability since all placental examinations were performed by only one pathologist . a disadvantage of this approach is that the reproducibility of placental findings is not validated , but we considered that outside the scope of the present study . in summary , we found that cam , chronic villitis , immature placental villi , sga , and maternal overweight but not vasculitis or funisitis are independently associated with risk for stillbirth at term .', '96% [ 1417 ] and in term liveborns from 5% to 68% [ 1319 ] . the fact that the majority of studies claiming high proportions of cam were from developing countries may suggest some kind of underlying geographical / environmental factor . other explanations may include differences in the definition of stillbirth and histological cam , interobserver variability between reporting pathologists , small sample sizes , or selection of material . the high frequency of cam in our control group might be additionally related to the selection criterion being liveborn , and not uncomplicated ( healthy ) pregnancy , in contrast to several other reports . our study is one of the largest studies in the literature and provides a comprehensive view of the stillbirth population in the major stockholm area . a high frequency of cam , vasculitis and/or funisitis could be due to the duration of established contractions or the time interval between broken membranes and delivery . a subanalysis of half of the vaginally delivered cases and controls did not show any difference concerning time between rupture of membranes and delivery but there was a significant difference regarding time from established contraction to delivery , with longer labour in the control group ( p < 0.05 , data not presented ) . although cam is generally believed to represent an ascending microbial infection [ 14 , 17 , 18 , 20 ] , our results of blood culture from the heart of the neonate failed to show a bacterial etiology of this placental inflammation . one reason for this might be that blood samples were only cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria . the presence of other microorganisms , such as ureaplasma or mycoplasma , which have been related to stillbirth in other studies , may have eluded detection . several studies have questioned the efficacy of culture alone for detecting bacteria [ 2123 ] suggesting the need for supplemental molecular techniques ( i.e. , pcr ) . the high risk of stillbirth correlated to severe cam point and to the importance of clarifying the background of cam since it is obviously a threat to the fetus in term pregnancy . vasculitis and funisitis are histological markers of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome and are risk markers for neurological impairment and decreased psychomotor development [ 6 , 24 ] . however , the relation between fetal', 'pcr analyses of the placenta were not routinely performed in the controls . the study was approved by the regional ethics committee of the karolinska institutet in stockholm , sweden ( no . all placentas were sent to the department of pathology at karolinska university hospital , huddinge . this design was specifically chosen in order to avoid the well -

however , the fact that treatment for some behavior is compulsory , and is not compulsory for others serves to highlight how gambling problems are not considered to be as serious as substance abuse problems . some methodological limitations must be noted ; the study was restricted to a small sample due to time and financial limitations . as people with differing mental health and support needs are allocated to an appropriate hostel , approximately equal numbers of participants were interviewed at each hostel to avoid a sampling bias . results should be replicated in a larger sample before more concrete conclusions can be drawn . each homeless individual has a different background and a different story , therefore certain aspects of data collection would be more suited to qualitative analysis ; however , to facilitate rapid data collection , interviews were structured , and answers were selected from a predetermined range of options allowing us to confidently establish prevalence rates . the results are limited to one local authority within london ( westminster ) , an area that is known to have a high concentration of bookmaker s shops as well as one of the highest concentrations of homeless people in the country . data from the current study reinforces the assertion that problem gambling is a significant issue within the homeless population , and is more commonly a cause than a consequence of homelessness . despite the elevated prevalence , fewer homeless gamblers are aware of , or seek treatment for , their gambling problems compared with those with substance abuse problems , highlighting the under - recognized nature of gambling problems . homelessness is a multiply - determined outcome arising from the interplay between individual characteristics and social structures . gambling is likely to be significant contributing factor for some people , and should be considered when assessing the treatment and support needs of the homeless . steve sharman contributed to study design , data collection , analysis , and manuscript preparation . ss , jd , & hbj declare that they have no competing or conflicting financial or commercial interest with regard to this paper . lc is the director of the centre for gambling research at ubc , which is supported by funding from the province of british columbia and the british columbia lottery corporation ( bclc ) . lc has not', 'homelessness involves a complex array of inter - woven contributing factors and consequences , which can include gambling , drugs , and alcohol misuse . homelessness can often result from poverty ( ocallaghan et al . , 1996 ) . financial hardship resulting from unemployment has previously been observed as a powerful predictor of homelessness ( kemp , lynch , & mackay , 2001 ) . recent studies have suggested that poverty can have negative psychological effects on economic decision - making , encouraging risky and short - sighted choices that can perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty ( haushofer & fehr , 2014 ) . for many , gambling may be seen as an escape route from these severe financial difficulties , whereby even modest wins may have a significant impact on quality of life ( lopes , 1987 ) . in the most recent british gambling prevalence survey ( bgps ) , 73% of the general adult population reported gambling in the past 12 months ( wardle et al . , 2011 ) and 0.7% met criteria for problem gambling using the problem gambling severity index ( pgsi , ferris & wynne , 2001 ) . as a postal survey , the bgps did not include various demographic sectors including the homeless , and a number of international studies have reported elevated levels of problem gambling in the homeless , in the range of 11.625% ( lepage , ladouceur , & jacques , 2000 ;

What does the article suggest about the role of visceral fat (VAT) in metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity?,"The article suggests that visceral fat (VAT) is more likely to be responsible for the metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity, as it is a stronger correlate of cardiovascular disease risk than BMI, waist circumference, or abdominal subcutaneous fat.","The article suggests that visceral fat (VAT) is more likely to be responsible for the metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity.

What type of organism is uncommon in infections of permanent pacemakers (PPMs) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)?,Gram-negative organisms,Gram-negative organisms,"['infections of permanent pacemakers ( ppms ) and implantable cardioverter -

negative bacteremia and ppm / icds , . we report a case of icd pocket infection with salmonella enterica serotype blockley ( salmonella blockley ) . to the best of our knowledge , a 76-year - old chinese man with systolic heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus who had undergone an icd placement in 2012 presented at the cardiology clinic for evaluation of the gradual onset of pain , redness and warmth from the icd pocket site for one month , more than a year after the surgery for implantation . he was recently prescribed an unrecalled oral antibiotic by his primary care provider without improvement , and there was note of insidious onset of erosion of skin over the pocket site . three weeks later , the wound developed purulent discharge and he was advised inpatient admission for treatment . at no point in the presenting illness did the patient develop fever , chills , or gastrointestinal symptoms . on physical examination , the left pectoral icd pocket site was tender , erythematous , and fluctuant , with a sinus draining purulent material . initial wound cultures obtained yielded salmonella blockley that was susceptible to ampicillin ( mic , 2 mg / l ) , trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( mic , 20 mg / l ) , levofloxacin ( mic , 0.12 mg identification of the isolate and susceptibility testing was done by the new york city department of health and mental hygiene . the serum creatinine level was 0.81 mg / dl and the peripheral white blood cell count was 5.8 10 cells / mm ( neutrophil percentage , 61.8% ) . the device was sent to the laboratory for cultures , which yielded s. blockley in both the generator and the leads . a peripherally inserted central catheter ( picc ) was placed and the patient was discharged with home care , to complete a 21-day course of ceftriaxone dosed at 2 g daily . he was readmitted briefly during this period to evacuate', ""blockley in both the generator and the leads . a peripherally inserted central catheter ( picc ) was placed and the patient was discharged with home care , to complete a 21-day course of ceftriaxone dosed at 2 g daily . he was readmitted briefly during this period to evacuate a hematoma that had developed over the former pocket site , but otherwise had an unremarkable convalescence . on 21-day follow - up at the outpatient infectious disease clinic , the wound was well - healed and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued . he was prescribed a 7-day course of amoxicillin clavulanate and continued to have no further complications on subsequent follow - up visits . it is estimated that between 1 and 7% of cardiac implantable electronic devices ( cied ) become infected , with the risk increased in patients with diabetes mellitus , previous glucocorticoid therapy , underlying malignancy , operator inexperience , multiple lead placement , advanced patient age , oral anticoagulant use , frequent generator replacement , heart failure , fever before implantation , use of temporary pacing catheters , nonpectoral implantations , and renal dysfunction . if the infection occurs within 2 weeks of implantation , staphylococcus aureus is most frequently implicated , but beyond this period , other organisms are more frequently seen , usually skin flora ( coagulase - negative staphylococci ) , s. aureus , other gram - positive cocci ( enterococcus and streptococcus ) and , less frequently , gram - negative bacilli , . the route of infection in our patient can be most likely attributed to secondary seeding from an enteric source , since salmonella species are not usually contaminants encountered at implantation , and clinical signs of infection appeared more than a year after surgery . during the patient 's clinical course , no organism was ever recovered in blood cultures , which indicates that there was probably transient bacteremia which led to seeding . the organism isolated from culture , salmonella blockley , is rarely encountered in human infections , and most of the literature describes gastrointestinal infections . one of the earliest reports of s. blockley infections was of an institutional outbreak due to contaminated ice cream with unpasteurized egg yolks . approximately 40% of 167 infected people manifested symptoms of moderate fever , diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal cramping . in 1998 , 35 cases"", '. one of the earliest reports of s. blockley infections was of an institutional outbreak due to contaminated ice cream with unpasteurized egg yolks . approximately 40% of 167 infected people manifested symptoms of moderate fever , diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal cramping . in 1998 , 35 cases of s. blockley gastroenteritis were reported throughout greece ; however , inquiries about various risk factors did not elucidate a common exposure among the cases . an outbreak of s. blockley gastroenteritis was also described in germany in june 1998 . in this study , antibiotic resistance patterns and molecular typing suggested that the source of the outbreak could be traced from fish farms in veneto , italy . isolates of s. blockley have been studied from contaminated pigs and poultry products in the far east , south africa , ethiopia , and italy , , , . our patient emigrated from china in 2009 and went on a tour of several european countries in 2011 , about a year prior to surgery . however , he did not report developing fever or gastrointestinal symptoms during or immediately after the trip . it can not be ascertained at which point our patient acquired an enteric s. blockley infection that may have led to subsequent infection of the icd . given the infection of the leads , superficial erosion of the pocket site , and formation of an abscess , removal of the icd was indicated for our patient . in cases of superficial or incisional infections , the isolate in our case was susceptible to beta - lactams and had intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin . effective treatment was achieved with removal of the device and prolonged administration of ceftriaxone , though in future cases , care must be taken to determine the susceptibility of the isolate , as multidrug resistance has been described . human infections with salmonella blockley are rare and most cases described are gastrointestinal in origin . our patient appears to be the first case of s. blockley infection of a pacemaker , though other salmonella species have been known to cause ppm / icd infections as well . device infections with salmonella must not be overlooked in patients who present late after surgery , especially with known residence or travel to endemic areas .', 'in 2006 , the world health organization ( who ) reported that out of the 130 million live births every year , 4 million die within the first four weeks of life . of these deaths , 99% occur in developing countries ( approximately half following difficult deliveries at home ) against 1% in developed countries . most of these deaths ( 30 - 40% ) are due to neonatal infections . according to the 2004 demographic health survey in cameroon , neonatal infections are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths , thus constituting a major public health problem . in cameroon and in most developing countries , a combination of three parenteral antibiotics - ampicillin , aminoside and a third generation cephalosporin which cover a broad spectrum of germs , is instituted to treat neonatal infections while awaiting culture and sensitivity tests . yet neonatal infections still claim the lives of many children in this setting . this study was aimed at determining the incidence and risk factors of neonatal bacterial infections , the clinical and bacteriological profile and sensitivity to antibiotics used , and the clinical outcomes in a referral mother and child hospital . the study was a prospective study in the neonatology unit of the yaounde gynaeco - obstetric and pediatric hospital , from the 18 november 2008 to 18 may 2009 . the study population consisted of all symptomatic neonates ( 0 to 28 days ) with a maternal history suggestive of infection admitted in this unit within the study period . patient selection was done in two phases : phase 1 : all the neonates , in - borns or out - borns with at least one of the following anamnestic or clinical criteria as developed by the french national agency for accreditation and health . phase 1 : all the neonates , in - borns or out - borns with at least one of the following anamnestic or clinical criteria as developed by the french national agency for accreditation and health . anamnestic criteria : unexplained prematurity with gestational age 35 weeks , prolonged rupture of membranes ( 12 hours ) , stained or purulent amniotic fluid , untreated recurrent urogenital infections in the last trimester of pregnancy , maternal fever of 38c during labor , delivery at home , apparently healthy twin with other symptomatic . clinical criteria : fever ( temperature', '. the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis in developing countries differ from those in developed countries . overall , gram negative pathogens are more common and group streptococcus , is generally rare . the small number of positive cultures reflects the difficulties neonatologists encounter when investigating babies with patent clinical signs and symptoms of neonatal infection in our setting . this makes it difficult to know the exact bacterial profile in our units and should draw our attention to the urgent need for the knowledge on the spectrum of germs responsible for neonatal infection so that treatment can be initiated early in the absence of culture and sensitivity a major finding in our study was the resistance of germs especially enterobacteria to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin , gentamycin and netilmicin . this resistance of isolated bacteria to commonly used antibiotics has also been observed in other developing countries[20 , 21 ] . gangou et al , in yaounde , had a similar observation of low sensitivity ( 35% ) of klebsiella spp . ciss et al in dakar , and hossein et al , in iran noted 100% resistance of klebsiella spp to ampicillin whereas there was a 33% resistance to gentamycin in dakar . who recommended in 1999 , and in 2002 , the empirical association of ampicillin and gentamycin despite the resistance of enterobacteria to these antibiotics and their high frequency as causative germs of neonatal sepsis in developing countries . sensitivity of isolates was best with imipenems , ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin which are not frequently used and are considerably expensive in a low - resource setting . however , the fact that these resistant germs were isolated in our study does not imply that they were the most common causes of neonatal infections since only less than 10% of the cultures gave a positive yield . concerning outcome , 48 ( 22% ) babies died , mostly within the few days of admission . low birth weight , prematurity and septicemia were the most frequent risk factors for death . according to the who , low birth weight neonates have 20 times more risk of dying than those of normal weight . aboussad et al in morrocco , observed that prematurity was a risk factor for death , whereas in france , prematurity was observed to be a criterion denoting severity of neonatal infection . escherichia']"

sulfamethoxazole ( mic , 20 mg / l ) , levofloxacin ( mic , 0.12 mg identification of the isolate and susceptibility testing was done by the new york city department of health and mental hygiene . the serum creatinine level was 0.81 mg / dl and the peripheral white blood cell count was 5.8 10 cells / mm ( neutrophil percentage , 61.8% ) . the device was sent to the laboratory for cultures , which yielded s. blockley in both the generator and the leads . a peripherally inserted central catheter ( picc ) was placed and the patient was discharged with home care , to complete a 21-day course of ceftriaxone dosed at 2 g daily . he was readmitted briefly during this period to evacuate', ""blockley in both the generator and the leads . a peripherally inserted central catheter ( picc ) was placed and the patient was discharged with home care , to complete a 21-day course of ceftriaxone dosed at 2 g daily . he was readmitted briefly during this period to evacuate a hematoma that had developed over the former pocket site , but otherwise had an unremarkable convalescence . on 21-day follow - up at the outpatient infectious disease clinic , the wound was well - healed and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued . he was prescribed a 7-day course of amoxicillin clavulanate and continued to have no further complications on subsequent follow - up visits . it is estimated that between 1 and 7% of cardiac implantable electronic devices ( cied ) become infected , with the risk increased in patients with diabetes mellitus , previous glucocorticoid therapy , underlying malignancy , operator inexperience , multiple lead placement , advanced patient age , oral anticoagulant use , frequent generator replacement , heart failure , fever before implantation , use of temporary pacing catheters , nonpectoral implantations , and renal dysfunction . if the infection occurs within 2 weeks of implantation , staphylococcus aureus is most frequently implicated , but beyond this period , other organisms are more frequently seen , usually skin flora ( coagulase - negative staphylococci ) , s. aureus , other gram - positive cocci ( enterococcus and streptococcus ) and , less frequently , gram - negative bacilli , . the route of infection in our patient can be most likely attributed to secondary seeding from an enteric source , since salmonella species are not usually contaminants encountered at implantation , and clinical signs of infection appeared more than a year after surgery . during the patient 's clinical course , no organism was ever recovered in blood cultures , which indicates that there was probably transient bacteremia which led to seeding . the organism isolated from culture , salmonella blockley , is rarely encountered in human infections , and most of the literature describes gastrointestinal infections . one of the earliest reports of s. blockley infections was of an institutional outbreak due to contaminated ice cream with unpasteurized egg yolks . approximately 40% of 167 infected people manifested symptoms of moderate fever , diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal cramping . in 1998 , 35 cases"", '. one of the earliest reports of s. blockley infections was of an institutional outbreak due to contaminated ice cream with unpasteurized egg yolks . approximately 40% of 167 infected people manifested symptoms of moderate fever , diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal cramping . in 1998 , 35 cases of s. blockley gastroenteritis were reported throughout greece ; however , inquiries about various risk factors did not elucidate a common exposure among the cases . an outbreak of s. blockley gastroenteritis was also described in germany in june 1998 . in this study , antibiotic resistance patterns and molecular typing suggested that the source of the outbreak could be traced from fish farms in veneto , italy . isolates of s. blockley have been studied from contaminated pigs and poultry products in the far east , south africa , ethiopia , and italy , , , . our patient emigrated from china in 2009 and went on a tour of several european countries in 2011 , about a year prior to surgery . however , he did not report developing fever or gastrointestinal symptoms during or immediately after the trip . it can not be ascertained at which point our patient acquired an enteric s. blockley infection that may have led to subsequent infection of the icd . given the infection of the leads , superficial erosion of the pocket site , and formation of an abscess , removal of the icd was indicated for our patient . in cases of superficial or incisional infections , the isolate in our case was susceptible to beta - lactams and had intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin . effective treatment was achieved with removal of the device and prolonged administration of ceftriaxone , though in future cases , care must be taken to determine the susceptibility of the isolate , as multidrug resistance has been described . human infections with salmonella blockley are rare and most cases described are gastrointestinal in origin . our patient appears to be the first case of s. blockley infection of a pacemaker , though other salmonella species have been known to cause ppm / icd infections as well . device infections with salmonella must not be overlooked in patients who present late after surgery , especially with known residence or travel to endemic areas .', 'reported here underwent parenteral rehydration and nutritional supplementation ; her general condition improved progressively , and her bowel movements were reduced to 23 per day , enabling her to be discharged within a month . however , her gastrointestinal symptoms persisted , and 3 fecal samples collected at 4 , 6 , and 7 months after discharge were positive for the same hcosv strain ( at a high titer of 1010 virus rna copies / ml feces ) but negative for other viruses , bacteria , and parasites . the infection was detected in 1 of 689 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms who were hospitalized and tested during the same period . unique to this patient were the prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and the chronic gastrointestinal symptoms with persistently hcosv - positive fecal samples . the persistence of symptoms and virus are additional new findings that might be associated with the patient s immune impairment . the source of infection has not been determined . however , the patient denied domestic or international travel and close contact with persons returning from travel . because no other hcosv infection was detected in patients hospitalized at the same institution during the same period , we hypothesize that the infection was acquired in the patient s community before her hospitalization . the genetic similarity with e strains circulating in south america , australia , and central africa suggest local acquisition of an imported infection . however , additional evidence is required before excluding the potential autochthonous circulation of hcosv in northern italy .', ""10 days . in case of growth a gram stain was done to orientate the diagnosis , and then inoculated in chapman 's culture medium or plain agar for staphylococcus , mc conkey or hektoen enteric agar for enterobacteria , and blood agar and chocolate agar for streptococcus . cerebrospinal fluid was first inoculated in chocolate and blood agar and then incubated in carbon dioxide at 37c for 24 -

nmda receptor encephalitis in the literature described the presentation of symptoms , diagnostic process , follow - up antibody titers , and neurological status . however , none of them described long - term rehabilitation strategies for these patients ; only two articles described inpatient rehabilitation programs in seven patients.6,7 our report highlights the sequential functional changes experienced by the young patient during the 28 months of rehabilitation ( both inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation ) , and pointed out the possible challenges during the rehabilitative programs . even so , the interventions and therapies described here may not be useful for all patients with anti - nmda receptor encephalitis . in cases of encephalitis of unknown cause and with characteristic symptoms , treatable anti - nmda receptor encephalitis should be taken into consideration and further intervention must be performed as early as possible . comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs , including physical , occupational , psychological , and speech training , are usually necessary for these patients and , generally , a good outcome can be expected .']"

thick fascicles of cells with a spindled nucleus and scant cytoplasm , interpreted as schwann cells on electron microscopy , and usually positive for s-100 protein . the overlying epidermis is intact and separated from the lesion by a so - called dermal grenz zone . in some cases , an infiltrative pattern into the subcutis has been observed , and a vascularized stroma , sometimes abundant , has been documented . in our cases , we were able to describe an unusually high vascular density compared not only with normal skin , but also with classical neurofibromas . in a series of neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis-1 and sporadic neurofibromas , high vascular density associated with increased vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity megahed described 10 histopathological variants of neurofibroma : classic , cellular , myxoid , hyalinized , epithelioid , plexiform , diffuse , pigmented , granular cell , and pacinian . subsequently , some other variants such as dendritic cell neurofibroma with pseudorosettes and lipomatous neurofibroma have been reported . the histopathological pattern of the solitary cutaneous neurofibroma cases with a higher vascular density , which we describe here , is very particular . we therefore propose this lesion to be a new histopathological variant of neurofibroma and name it angioneurofibroma . the gross appearance of angioneurofibromas should be compared to that of classical neurofibromas for any macroscopic difference . this feature might help to correctly interpret a highly vascularized lesion showing a histopathological pattern and immunohistochemical phenotype of neurofibroma , and to design new treatment strategies including angiogenesis inhibitors for these tumors .', '- inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and may contribute to amplification of the inflammatory response [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] . in support to this hypothesis , it has been shown that septic stimuli ( e.g. , lps , tnf- ) initiate activation of transcription factors such as nfb and ap-1 , resulting in transcriptional activation of multiple genes . this leads to the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. tnf- , il-1 etc ) , and increased expression of adhesion molecules ( e.g. e - selectin , icam-1 , vcam-1 ) and chemokines by endothelial cells [ 11 , 1719 ] . a key role of ros / rns in modulation of the endothelial cell pro - inflammatory phenotype has been highlighted previously ( fig . 1 ) . given the complexity of sirs and sepsis , it is perhaps not surprising that little progress has been made in improving outcome . efforts to block one or other component of the sepsis - associated inflammatory pathways have had little impact on patient survival . future advances in sepsis therapy will depend on improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology . in this review , we will focus on the early events in the response to septic stimuli of microvascular endothelial cells , the cell type that occurs in all organs . the endothelium provides a non - adhesive and anti - thrombotic surface for blood - born components , including circulating leukocytes . however , during sepsis , the microvascular endothelium is activated to a pro - adhesive and pro - thrombotic phenotype . in addition , septic endothelium becomes both a target and a source of ros and rns , and it thereby contributes to the onset of organ dysfunction [ 19 , 25 ] . clinically , sepsis is characterized by a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation . it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ; ( ii ) increased capillary permeability that manifests as']"
What was the underlying condition that led to the 43-year-old woman undergoing bilateral lung transplantation?,Severe chronic respiratory failure caused by bilateral bronchiectasis.,Severe chronic respiratory failure caused by bilateral bronchiectasis.,"['in 2003 , a 43-year - old white woman who had undergone a pulmonary lobectomy during childhood underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of severe chronic respiratory failure caused by bilateral bronchiectasis . the posttransplant period was complicated by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome stage 1 , with episodes of acute respiratory distress . the immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus ( through level 1015 ng / ml ) , low - dose steroids ( 0.10 mg / kg / day ) , and monthly courses of extracorporeal photopheresis that were initiated after a 3-month course of low - dose azythromycin ( discontinued because of lack of efficacy ) . in january 2012 she had cough and fever ( 38c ) , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea ( 610 bowel movements / day , liquid but not bloody ) . routine fecal examination and cultures were negative for common gastrointestinal bacteria ( mycobacteria , salmonella , shigella , and campylobacter spp . ) , parasites ( protozoa and helminths ) , and viruses ( astrovirus , norovirus , rotavirus , adenovirus ) . because of the patient s persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and a positive fecal calprotectin result , a colonoscopy was performed ; it revealed inflamed cecal mucosa without ulcerative lesions . histologic examination of colonic biopsy samples showed mild , chronic , interstitial inflammation , including eosinophils and lymphoid microaggregates . therefore , fecal samples were examined for less common gastroenteric viral agents rhinovirus , bocavirus , enterovirus , parechovirus , coronavirus , sapovirus , aichivirus and hcosv by using conventional and real - time pcr or nested reverse transcription pcr ( rt - pcr ) ( 1,714 ) . this virus was detected by a nested rt - pcr targeting the 5 untranslated region ( utr ) ( 1 ) and quantified on the basis of serial log10 dilution of extracted nucleic acid estimating the presence of 10 rna copies / ml in fecal samples . the 316-bp 5 utr amplicon was sequenced by using an abi prism 3100 dna automatic sequencer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , assembled by sequencer software , version 5.0 ( gene codes corporation , ann arbor , mi , usa ) , and compared with available hcosv sequences with the blast program ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) . nucleotide identity with the hcosv species d ( species d1 ) ( genbank accession no', 'bilateral submental regions , the shoulder and the upper thoracic area . but under the suspicion of pneumothorax in the right lung , a prompt resolution of the pneumoperitoneum was requested prior to further aggravating the condition of the patient . the surgical procedure was completed 15 minutes after the request to halt the pneumoperitoneum . with the resolution of the pneumoperitoneum , the peak airway pressure decreased to 21 cmh2o and the end - tidal co2 decreased to 37 mmhg . a chest ap x - ray was performed and this confirmed the occurrence of pneumothorax in the right lung ( fig . the arterial blood gas analysis showed a ph of 7.34 , a paco2 of 44 mmhg , a pao2 of 389 mmhg and a sao2 of 99% . this was followed by removing the endotracheal tube . except for the pain at the site of surgery , the patient did not complain of respiratory distress . using an oxygen mask , oxygen 5 l / min was administered to the patient . following the surgery , the disappearance of pneumothorax was confirmed on the chest x - ray that was performed again in a recovery room ( fig . a chest x - ray on the third post - operative day showed no abnormal findings , and the chest tube was removed . there is a trend that laparoscopic tep inguinal hernia repair is now being performed as an alternative to traditional open repair or laparoscopic transabominal preperitoneal hernia repair . in particular , laparoscopic tep hernia repair is a method that is favored for patients with recurrent or bilateral hernias . the advantages of laparoscopic tep inguinal hernia repair include a low recurrence rate and a reduced risk of intraabdominal infection or contamination , and damage to the intra - abdominal organs and adhesion , as compared with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair or an open procedure . it also causes less postoperative pain and it enables patients to promptly return to their daily lives [ 2 - 4 ] . there has been extensive discussion on the complications associated with the management of anesthesia during laparoscopic surgery . pneumothorax is one of the serious complications , although it rarely occurs in association with laparoscopic surgery . yet in cases of laparoscopic tep hernia repair , surgical procedures such as the insufflation of co2 or', 'was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit . her brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) found leptomeningeal enhancement at bilateral frontoparietal area , nodular enhancement along the tentorium , and some tiny white - matter lesions over bilateral frontal lobes ( figure 1 ) . a complete etiologic investigation showed insufficient evidence of bacterial infection , electrolyte imbalance , intoxication , or endocrine disturbances . at first , under the clinical suspicion of meningoencephalitis , she was empirically treated with acyclovir plus azithromycin . after a cerebrospinal fluid nmda receptor antibody study reported positive results , the antibiotics were shifted to intravenous immunoglobulin for two courses , followed by pulse methylprednisolone therapy ( 30 mg / kg / dose , four doses ) and maintenance oral prednisolone ( 0.9 mg / kg / day ) . her choreoathetosis and orofacial dyskinesia recovered partially for several weeks , but these symptoms reappeared after we discontinued prednisolone because of her episodic sepsis , autonomic instability , and poorly - controlled gastrointestinal bleeding . the pediatric neurologist prescribed plasmaphoresis about 3 months after onset of symptoms , but it was discontinued because of anaphylactic reactions and bilateral pneumonia with collapsed lung . she received a combination therapy of weekly rituximab ( 375 mg / m , four doses ) and prolonged monthly cyclophosphamide pulse therapy ( 750 mg / m , 8 months ) , followed by azathioprine for 3 months . for her inpatient rehabilitation program , passive range - of - motion exercise was performed for her during periods of protracted sedation to prevent contracture . after cyclophosphamide and rituximab was applied for 6 weeks , her troublesome generalized choreoathetosis attenuated gradually . we started intensive facilitation and postural training after tapering off the sedative agents . in order to prevent oral dyskinesia -

old man with a weight of 65 kg and a height of 172 cm visited with a chief complaint of a 2-month - history of a mass in the left inguinal area . the patient was diagnosed with a left inguinal hernia and then he was hospitalized for laparoscopic tep hernia repair . normal findings were seen on the preoperative chest radiography , the ekg and the pulmonary function tests ( fig . the patient was premedicated with midazolam 2 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly 30 minutes before anesthesia . following arrival at the operation room , the blood pressure was 150/90 mmhg , the heart rate was 85 times / min and the peripheral o2 saturation was 98% . for the induction of anesthesia , thiopental sodium 300 mg and rocuronium 40 mg were given intravenously , and this was followed by tracheal intubation . there were no problems during endotracheal intubation . following confirmation that there were no problems with ventilation in both lungs , a tube was fixed in the area that was 23 cm away from the incisor . the anesthesia was maintained with o2 2.0 l / min , air 2.0 l / min , desflurane 4 - 6 vol% and remifentanil 0.3 - 0.5 g / min / kg . following the induction of anesthesia , mechanical ventilation was initiated at a tidal volume of 8 ml / kg and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths / min , which produced a peak airway pressure of 17 - 18 mmhg . at the start of surgery , the end - tidal co2 was 32 mmhg , the peripheral o2 saturation was 99 - 100% , the blood pressure was 110/70 mmhg and the heart rate was 85 times / min', ""in the anterior chambers and posterior synechiae bilaterally ( fig . dilated fundus examination revealed vitreal cells and haze , which were present bilaterally , but more distinct in the left eye . 1c , d ) and peripheral retinal punched -

ebbert and limper 2005 ; mejias et al 2005 ) the disease burden associated with rsv infection is considerable as rsv is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide having infection rates approaching 70%80% in the first year of life with many patients requiring hospitalization ( mccarthy and hall 2003 ; leung et al 2005 ) . unfortunately , despite five decades of research , no safe and effective rsv vaccine is available and few effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments are available . thus , there is a critical need for the development of novel tools and platforms to augment virus diagnosis and foundational studies required for development of disease intervention strategies . the surface topography of viruses lends to detection by antibodies , a feature that has been successfully used for bio - conjuagted np detection of rsv ( agrawal et al 2005 , 2006 ;

What explanation does the article provide for the observed reduced mortality rate among patients with a supratherapeutic INR due to warfarin use?,"The reduced mortality may have been due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions, which could be more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation, or due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.","The article suggests that the reduced mortality rate among patients with a supratherapeutic INR due to warfarin use may be due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions, which can be effectively controlled by reversing the anticoagulation in addition to endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitor infusion. Another possible explanation is that the lower mortality rate may be due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.","['bleeding were higher for all of these agents when compared with warfarin ; however , mortality from bleeding was lower primarily because of a reduced rate of fatal intracranial hemorrhage . as clinical experience accumulates for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with the use of factor x inhibitors or direct thrombin inhibitors , the outcome of these patients will become clearer . because it is retrospective in nature , this analysis is subject to potential sources of bias . the most important of these is that the inclusion of patients in the study was subject to the performance of endoscopy , and the threshold for performing endoscopy may have differed between patients taking warfarin and those not taking warfarin . however , the proportion of patients receiving blood transfusion , and the clinical and laboratory parameters suggestive of heavy bleeding at presentation ( serum urea and hemoglobin levels , pulse rate , and blood pressure ) , were similar between the sa patients and those in the control group , suggesting that the severity of bleeding was similar in the two groups . despite high levels of comorbidity , which are known to predict a poor outcome , a supratherapeutic inr at presentation due to warfarin use was associated with reduced mortality in patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage . reduced mortality may have been due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions , with such bleeding more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitor infusion . alternatively , the lower mortality rate may have been due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin .', 'patients taking warfarin typically have significant comorbidity , often related to the indication for which their warfarin was prescribed . comorbidity is known to be associated with increased mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 3 . previous studies have not adjusted for comorbidity when analysing the outcome of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users , and therefore they may have overestimated the association between mortality and warfarin use 4 5 . the coagulopathy induced by warfarin is readily reversible , providing a treatment strategy that may improve outcome . this effect is likely to be most apparent in patients taking warfarin who have a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio ( inr ) . this analysis compares 30-day mortality from upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users with a supratherapeutic inr and 30-day mortality in non warfarin users , adjusting for potential confounding by matching to a control group for variables known to influence survival in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage . the study was conducted in a single regional hospital ( waikato hospital , hamilton , new zealand ) between 23rd february 2001 and 12 october 2010 . for all patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at presentation to the hospital or during an admission for a different condition , the following were recorded prospectively in a dedicated upper gastrointestinal bleed database : presenting features , endoscopic diagnosis , presence of stigmata of recent hemorrhage ( including forrest classification of peptic ulceration ) 6 7 and administered treatment . those patients with evidence of variceal bleeding were excluded from the analysis . when a patient had more than one episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage during the study period , only the first event was included . additional clinical and laboratory data at presentation were retrospectively collected through review of the clinical record . data regarding the use of prothrombinex ( pooled purified human coagulation factors ii , ix , and x ;

for some , however , the risk of thromboembolism was perceived to be high , and warfarin or intravenous heparin was commenced within this period . a possible explanation for the observed difference in mortality is that supratherapeutic anticoagulation produces clinically significant bleeding from lower - risk mucosal lesions . patients can be readily treated by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to standard management ( endoscopic therapy and intravenous infusion of omeprazole ) . a higher proportion of patients in the sa group with only gastric or duodenal erosions seen at endoscopy supports this hypothesis . a trend toward an increased rate of surgery in the control group is also supportive . the small number of deaths in this study precludes statistical analysis of the causes of death in a meaningful way . it is biologically plausible that there may be a beneficial effect of anticoagulation on the cardiac circulation during a time of physiologic stress , such as', ""the unselected upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage cohort . in the sa group , 88 patients were receiving warfarin as stroke prophylaxis because of atrial fibrillation , 17 for a prosthetic heart valve , 16 for a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation , 4 for venous thromboembolism , and 3 for other reasons . there was a trend toward more benign endoscopic diagnoses in the sa group . in the patients with peptic ulceration , there was no significant difference in forrest classification between the two groups ( sa group : 10 of 42 class i , 5 of 42 class iia , 7 of 42 class iib ;

What is a common reason for adult intussusception (AI) to occur?,AI often occurs due to a pathologic lead point located in a single region of bowel.,A common reason for adult intussusception (AI) to occur is the presence of a pathologic lead point in the bowel.,"['adult intussusception ( ai ) is a rare cause of bowel obstruction and is often associated with a pathologic lead point located in a single region of bowel . the mechanism of intussusception is not fully understood , but it is believed to result from a lesion in the bowel wall that alters the peristaltic pattern of the bowel causing invagination . in cases where no lead point is identified , intussusception may be due to submucosal bowel edema , fibrous adhesions or dysrhythmic contractions . the management of intussusception in adults differs from that of children , where the diagnosis is more common and treatment is based primarily on radiological reduction . surgical resection is recommended in cases of ai because it has been associated with a lead point in up to 95% of cases [ 13 ] . however , given the abundant utilization of abdominal imaging , ai is also diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients , in which no clinical sequelae occur and surgery is not indicated . this results in a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma , particularly in a patient with multiple simultaneous regions of small bowel intussusception . a 41-year - old female presented with 3 weeks of intermittent crampy epigastric abdominal pain , nausea and diarrhea . she had one episode of vomiting and lost 6 lbs over the course of 3 weeks . the patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy using a 5 mm 30 camera and two 5 mm working ports . six separate regions of intussusception within the small bowel were discovered between 55 and 130 cm from the ligament of treitz . all areas of intussusception were short and witnessed to undergo spontaneously reduction ( fig . there was no obvious evidence of masses , adhesions or serosal abnormalities along the small bowel . she had resolution of symptoms and had no recurrence after 3 years of follow - up . pathologic examination of the small bowel demonstrated no evidence of malignancy , lead point , pathologic changes or sprue . likewise , there was no evidence of acid - fast organisms , fungal or helminth parts identified . the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes demonstrated reactive follicular hyperplasia and multifocal non - necrotizing lipogranulomas . figure 1:(a ) the ct scan of the abdomen demonstrating an area of small bowel intussusception ( arrow ) resulting in a mushroom sign .

dimensional deformation of the spinal column as the most common paediatric orthopaedic pathology . its incidence , according to different sources , varies from 2 to 6% of the total paediatric population , while 3 in 1000 adolescents require severe reconstructive spinal surgery . ais is characterized by its relationship with the pubertal period , its much higher incidence in adolescent girls as compared with boys ( from 1 : 7 to 1 : 10 according to various authors ) , and poor prediction of the course of the disease . the process of deformation can stop spontaneously without treatment at some point , but it can also progress rapidly up to an angle of 70 degrees or more [ 1 , 2 ] . although the first mention of scoliosis goes back as far as hippocrates ( c. 460370 bc ) , to date there is no factual , scientifically feasible theory of ais aetiology and pathogenesis . accordingly , there are no reliable methods for predicting the extent and rate of spinal deformation , nor for its effective treatment and prevention . one of the main reasons for this state is the lack of an effective model reproducing all the specific features of the pathological process in animals . conventional animal models ( peripheral nerve disruption , muscle extirpation , vertebral and intertverebral disc lesions , etc . ) are artificial to a considerable extent , so that their results can not be satisfactorily transferred into clinical practice . the most effective scoliosis models are those of pinealectomized chickens and bipedal infant rats . it was shown that removal of the pineal gland in chickens leads to stage - by - stage three - dimensional deformation of the spinal column , as in humans . the authors interpreted development of experimental scoliosis as a result of disturbance of the symmetrical growth of spine and paraspinal muscles , due to disturbance of melatonin synthesis . the same results were obtained in experiments on rats , which , at the birth of resected front paws and tail , caused the animal to move on two hind legs ( bipedal rats ) . thus , researchers have obtained a model of a mammal with the vertical spinal column . however , the', 'progress to interval cancers . ssas share common features with interval cancers , such as right colon predominance , msi , and a cimp - high phenotype.44 in a multicenter study involving 32 endoscopy centers,45 the detection of proximal serrated lesions varied greatly among endoscopy centers ( p<0.0001 ) , and there was also substantial variation among pathologists in the identification of sessile , serrated lesions . fortunately , clinically significantly serrated polyps may be easier to detect with longer withdrawal times.46 the new hampshire colonoscopy registry study showed that a withdrawal time of 9 min resulted in a nearly 30% relative increase in serrated polyp detection.46 therefore , systemic education programs on serrated lesions as well as colonoscopy quality may improve the recognition and diagnosis of serrated lesions . recent evidence suggests that interval cancers are caused by a deficiency in the quality of colonoscopy rather than accelerated tumor biology.12,19 this is good news , as most interval cancers may be prevented by improving colonoscopy quality . first , as described above , interval cancers may develop from suboptimal quality indicators such as withdrawal time , adr , complete colonoscopy , and bowel preparation , as well as incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 in addition , the identification of serrated lesions may be improved with longer withdrawal time.46 second , the grade , stage , histology , and survival patterns do not differ between patients with interval cancer and those with non - interval cancer , which does not suggest an aggressive biology , but rather that the majority represent missed lesions.25,47 in a danish population - based registry,25 982 danish individuals with interval cancers were compared to two reference groups , namely , 358 individuals with crc identified more than 10 years after a colonoscopy and 35,707 individuals with crc but no prior colonoscopy . in this study , no significant differences were found in the characteristics of patients and tumors or survival between interval cancers and cancers arising more than 10 years after colonoscopy.25 the adjusted mortality rate ratios of interval cancers to non - interval cancers were 0.92 and 1.0 after 1 years and 5 years , respectively.25 finally , cases of missed cancer are more common when the colonoscopy is performed by non - gastroenterologists.12,48 a recent canadian registry study12 showed that endoscopist specialty remains a significant predictor of missed cancers despite adjustment for', 'in experiments on rats , which , at the birth of resected front paws and tail , caused the animal to move on two hind legs ( bipedal rats ) . thus , researchers have obtained a model of a mammal with the vertical spinal column . however , the mechanism of this deformation in experimental model is still disputable [ 68 ] . in some experimental work administration of the hormone melatonin , normally secreted by the pineal gland , to pinealectomized animals was shown to prevent deformation ; while in other works this claim is disputed . was reported in the blood of children with ais ; however , an attempt to administer melatonin to such children ( a sort of substitution therapy ) was ineffective . other authors found no significant differences in blood concentrations of this hormone and melatonin metabolites in the urine of healthy children compared with that of children with ais . positron emission tomography ( pet ) studies also failed to reveal any differences in metabolic intensity in a pineal gland area in patients with ais compared with that of healthy controls . thus , the only evidence is that the removal of the melatonin - producing pineal gland with the resulting failure of melatonin production in growing animals with a vertical spine leads to scoliosis similar to that observed in humans . muscle tone changes due to disrupted sleep - wake cycles or homeostasis [ 4 , 13 ] are considered by the majority of specialists to be entirely irrelevant to these phenomena . the main objective of the present work was to study the functioning of brain structures which regulate melatonin secretion in patients with ais , using electrophysiology methods in order to better understand ais aetiopathogenesis and possibly to develop methods for the prevention , treatment , and prognosis of the deformation process . the main group contained 292 children with ais of varied severity ( 44 children , grade i ; 109 children , grade ii ; 105 , grade iii ; 34 , grade iv ) , and the control group consisted of 46 healthy children of the same age group . all were patients at the ogonyok rehabilitation center of pediatric orthopedics and traumatology during 20062009 . the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the ogonyok rehabilitation center of pediatric orthopedics and traumatology .']"

8% of diagnosed crcs are interval cancers ) , approximately 823 - 1,647 interval cancers might be expected to occur annually in korea . considering the increasing age of the general population and the number of colonoscopies performed in korea , the incidence of interval cancer is expected to increase . regardless of the magnitude of this problem , the medical and social impact of the failure of colonoscopy to prevent crcs may be devastating.27 therefore , prompt elucidation of the factors implicated in interval cancers is necessary . although the exact etiology of interval cancer is unknown , there are several potential explanations for such interval cancers . first , precancerous or cancerous lesions may have been missed at the time of colonoscopy.30 withdrawal time and technique deserve special consideration in this context , as the detection rate of colorectal neoplasia depends on the withdrawal time during colonoscopy . barclay et al.31 demonstrated that a withdrawal time 6 min is strongly correlated with an increased adenoma detection rate ( adr ) . in addition , careful inspection of the oral side of the mucosal folds is more important than simple adherence to a standard withdrawal time , especially in the proximal colon.32,33 the adr itself is also an important quality indicator for predicting the risk of interval cancers after screening colonoscopy . kaminski et al.17 demonstrated that the adr of endoscopist was significantly associated with the risk of interval cancer ( p=0.008 ) . endoscopies with an adr of less than 11.0% were associated with a 10.94-fold ( 95% ci , 1.37 -

polypoid lesions , which have a subtle endoscopic appearance , may be more easily missed , especially by endoscopists with lower adr and in inadequate bowel preparations.13 previous several studies showed that non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers share some common features:15,19,35,36 both lesions are common in the proximal colon,15,19,35 and interval cancers have a flat appearance.36 although the relationship between non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers has not yet been clarified , endoscopists should be careful not to miss non - polypoid lesions during colonoscopy , especially in the right - sided colon . second , interval cancers may develop from the incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 the recent complete adenoma resection study showed that complete resection of neoplasia is far less common than previously thought.37 in the complete adenoma resection study , the incomplete resection rate varied broadly ( 6.5 - 22.7% ) among endoscopists , and was significantly higher in large and sessile lesions . robertson et al.38 showed that 26% of interval cancers occur in the same anatomic segments as those of a previous polypectomy , suggesting a possible role for incomplete polypectomy in the development of interval cancers . a dietary polyp prevention trial showed a similar rate of interval cancers after incomplete polypectomy.36 in this trial , in 4 of 13 patients , interval cancers were associated with incomplete polypectomy . lieberman et al.39 showed that the 5-year interval cancer rate after a normal colonoscopy without polypectomy is 0.17% , whereas', 'in 2003 , a 43-year - old white woman who had undergone a pulmonary lobectomy during childhood underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of severe chronic respiratory failure caused by bilateral bronchiectasis . the posttransplant period was complicated by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome stage 1 , with episodes of acute respiratory distress . the immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus ( through level 1015 ng / ml ) , low - dose steroids ( 0.10 mg / kg / day ) , and monthly courses of extracorporeal photopheresis that were initiated after a 3-month course of low - dose azythromycin ( discontinued because of lack of efficacy ) . in january 2012 she had cough and fever ( 38c ) , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea ( 610 bowel movements / day , liquid but not bloody ) . routine fecal examination and cultures were negative for common gastrointestinal bacteria ( mycobacteria , salmonella , shigella , and campylobacter spp . ) , parasites ( protozoa and helminths ) , and viruses ( astrovirus , norovirus , rotavirus , adenovirus ) . because of the patient s persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and a positive fecal calprotectin result , a colonoscopy was performed ; it revealed inflamed cecal mucosa without ulcerative lesions . histologic examination of colonic biopsy samples showed mild , chronic , interstitial inflammation , including eosinophils and lymphoid microaggregates . therefore , fecal samples were examined for less common gastroenteric viral agents rhinovirus , bocavirus , enterovirus , parechovirus , coronavirus , sapovirus , aichivirus and hcosv by using conventional and real -

What are the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide according to the article?,SIRS and sepsis are the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide.,SIRS and sepsis are the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide according to the article.,"['birth weight neonates have 20 times more risk of dying than those of normal weight . aboussad et al in morrocco , observed that prematurity was a risk factor for death , whereas in france , prematurity was observed to be a criterion denoting severity of neonatal infection . escherichia coli , klebsiella spp and enterobacter spp were the most frequent germs responsible for the deaths . these findings are similar to those of cisse et al in the dakar university teaching hospital . this study and others , demonstrate that the germs usually responsible for mortality are those which are most resistant to empirical treatment . we think new guidelines need to be drawn , coupled with larger more recent bodies of evidence to combat neonatal infections and reduce neonatal death in settings with limited diagnostic resources . strengths and limitations : this study is the first prospective study of its kind in this setting which is a mother and child referral hospital in the capital yaounde , the capital city of cameroon . the results obtained will serve as baseline data for future larger prospective studies . the fact that infection was confirmed bacteriologically in only 42 neonates is a major limitation of our study . some of the neonates had been through other health facilities where antibiotherapy was administered before being referred to the hospital , coupled with the fact that some parents could not pay for laboratory tests , and the small sample size . this however emphasizes the need for up to date knowledge on the management of neonatal infections in the absence of laboratory confirmation especially in low resource settings . we conclude that neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates in cameroon despite recent improvements in the health care system . the emergence of resistant bacterial strains to commonly used antibiotics in this low resource setting is a serious problem . we thus recommend the rational use of first line antibiotics in the management of neonatal sepsis with periodic evaluation of the bacterial ecology and sensitivity to antibiotics .', ""in the previous issue of critical care , wacharasint and colleagues ' investigation into obesity in septic shock adds to the contradictory studies on the effects of obesity in critical illness . since 1980 , global obesity has nearly doubled , with over 1.4 billion adults overweight or obese , defined by a body mass index ( bmi ) 25 kg / m.obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , and certain malignancies . yearly , 2.8 million deaths worldwide are attributable to obesity . up to 40% of icu patients obese icu patients have higher rates of ventilator - associated pneumonia , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , and cardiovascular complications . early studies found an increased mortality rate in the critically ill obese , particularly in long - stay , morbidly obese ( bmi 40 kg / m ) subjects . however , more recent literature supports the obesity paradox , the notion that obesity confers a protective effect in certain disease states . obesity in critical illness appears to exert no effect on mortality , or may even decrease mortality , despite longer icu stay and time to resolve organ failure . in the past two decades , it seems there has been a shift in care and outcomes of the critically ill obese . in wacharasint and colleagues ' cohort of patients in septic shock , infection profiles differed , with lower rates of lung and fungal infection in the obese . like other studies , they found that most intensivists still approach adults of varying weights with uniform doses of fluid and vasopressors . excessive fluid resuscitation may cause harm . perhaps the lower weight - based dose confoundingly leads to a perceived protective effect of obesity . sussing out useful information on given the contradictory data on inflammatory markers , it is likely that the appropriate complement of markers for study in critical illness remains unidentified . despite the known difficulties of ventilating obese patients given decreased chest wall compliance , increased gastric reflux , increased ventilator - associated pneumonia , and wacharasint and colleagues ' finding of inappropriately high tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation when compared to their nonobese cohort , the obese still had lower rates of lung infection . these mortality data contradict earlier findings in the critically ill morbidly obese and"", 'it frequently occurs after trauma , hemorrhage , burn or abdominal surgery , which cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . without timely and aggressive therapeutic intervention , sirs and sepsis remain the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide , with mortality rates ranging between 30 and 70% [ 4 , 5 ] . the initiating event in sepsis may be release of endotoxins ( i.e. , bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) ) from gram - negative and gram - positive pathogenic bacteria . lps triggers activation of inflammatory cells , such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( neutrophils ; pmn ) , monocytes / macrophages and lymphocytes . it is generally agreed that it is not the bacterial infection itself , but rather the inflammatory response to infection that is the predominant determinant of outcome in sepsis [ 7 , 8 ] . one of the key features of sepsis is tissue infiltration by phagocytic cells [ 913 ] . in this scenario , pmn and monocytes / macrophages respond to septic stimulation by producing reactive oxygen species ( ros ) ( e.g. , superoxide , hydrogen peroxide ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) ( e.g. , nitric oxide ) . in addition , pmn release granular enzymes ( e.g. elastase , cathepsin ) and the myeloperoxidase ( mpo)-derived oxidant , hypochlorous acid ( hocl ) . all these components may contribute to pmn / macrophage - mediated killing of the bacteria . however , if produced in excess during sirs and sepsis , the ros , rns and proteolytic enzymes cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction ( fig . 1 ) . an inflammatory response to septic stimuli is crucial for host defense , because it up - regulates anti - inflammatory mediators ( e.g. , il-1 receptor antagonist , il-4 , il-10 ) and antioxidant enzymes ( e.g. , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , manganese superoxide dismutase ) . however , excessive production of pro - inflammatory mediators in sepsis overwhelms the anti - inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and', ""increased ventilator - associated pneumonia , and wacharasint and colleagues ' finding of inappropriately high tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation when compared to their nonobese cohort , the obese still had lower rates of lung infection . these mortality data contradict earlier findings in the critically ill morbidly obese and the use of low tidal volumes in acute lung injury . how can we explain the decreased mortality in the obese , particularly the morbidly obese , observed in this and other studies ? we acknowledge that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring systems overestimate the severity of illness in the obese by incorporating markers that differ in otherwise healthy obese patients , like creatinine and oxygenation . there are three possible explanations for how the obese , especially morbidly obese , may experience better outcomes in the icu today as compared to decades past . first , and most likely , this special population has received heightened attention and the consequence has been improved outcomes . icus have developed better turning , skin , mobilization , oral , and pulmonary toilet protocols . it is possible our inadvertent ' under ' dosing of obese patients ' fluids and vasopressors conferred a protective effect . imaging tables that support the greater weight of morbidly obese patients have opened upmodalities and improved the diagnosis of life - threatening illness . improvements in glycemic control have benefited the obese , who are likelier to have dysglycemia and diabetes . improved ventilation and extubation protocols have probably improved outcomes in the obese who have higher rates of atelectasis , hypoxemia , and obstructive sleep apnea . second , the observation of an obesity paradox in critical illness typically arises from retrospective or post hoc analyses or meta - analyses of the same . these studies pose interesting questions but do not prove the existence of an obesity paradox . even when matching severity of illness in the obese and non - obese , scoring systems do not do justice when comparing a 70 kg patient with a 270 kg patient . it may be that outcomes in the mildly obese are no worse than for normal or overweight subjects . third , the finding of an obesity paradox in the critically ill , counter to general population outcomes , may be a mirage , an optical phenomenon that does not actually"", 'in 2006 , the world health organization ( who ) reported that out of the 130 million live births every year , 4 million die within the first four weeks of life . of these deaths , 99% occur in developing countries ( approximately half following difficult deliveries at home ) against 1% in developed countries . most of these deaths ( 30 - 40% ) are due to neonatal infections . according to the 2004 demographic health survey in cameroon , neonatal infections are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths , thus constituting a major public health problem . in cameroon and in most developing countries , a combination of three parenteral antibiotics - ampicillin , aminoside and a third generation cephalosporin which cover a broad spectrum of germs , is instituted to treat neonatal infections while awaiting culture and sensitivity tests . yet neonatal infections still claim the lives of many children in this setting . this study was aimed at determining the incidence and risk factors of neonatal bacterial infections , the clinical and bacteriological profile and sensitivity to antibiotics used , and the clinical outcomes in a referral mother and child hospital . the study was a prospective study in the neonatology unit of the yaounde gynaeco -

What can cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction during SIRS and sepsis?,"Excessive production of ROS, RNS and proteolytic enzymes during SIRS and sepsis can cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction.","Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and proteolytic enzymes can cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction during SIRS and sepsis.","['a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation . it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ; ( ii ) increased capillary permeability that manifests as a breakdown of the microvascular endothelial barrier ; ( iii ) loss of the anti - adhesive function of endothelial surfaces ; ( iv ) coagulopathy ; ( v ) decreased density of perfused capillaries and elevated proportion of non - perfused capillaries , even in fluid - resuscitated patients with adequate arterial blood oxygenation and cardiac output [ 6 , 2633 ] . tissue hypoxia develops because the diffusion distance for oxygen increases between blood and tissue cells . this may explain why approximately one - third of patients with severe sepsis ( i.e. , sepsis with at least one organ failure or dysfunction ) die of organ failure even when shock is prevented by fluid resuscitation and administration of vasopressor drugs [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] . for example , superoxide is a ros that is synthesized in endothelial cells by the mitochondrial electron transport chain , xanthine oxidase , uncoupled nitric oxide synthases ( nos ) and nadph oxidases . bacterial bloodstream infection exposes endothelial cells to blood - borne endotoxins ( e.g. , e. coli lipopolysaccharide , lps ) and inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , interferon- , ifn ) . the cells respond to this septic insult by activating endothelial nadph oxidases that synthesize intracellular superoxide . indeed , nadph oxidase activity is the principal source for stimulated production of superoxide in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to septic insult [ 3638 ] . for example , in microvascular endothelial cell cultures , septic insult ( lps and ifn in combination ; lps + ifn ) increases superoxide levels within 2 h . nadph oxidase evidently is the principal source because the rise in superoxide levels is abolished by nadph oxidase inhibitors ( apocynin and diphenylene iodonium ) but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration ( rotenone ) , xanthine oxidase ( allopurinol ) or nos ( l - name ) . longer incubation ( 12 h ) with lps + ifn increases nadph oxidase activity and nadph oxidase protein expression . increases in intracellular ros , whether caused by acute stimulation of nadph oxidase', '- inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and may contribute to amplification of the inflammatory response [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] . in support to this hypothesis , it has been shown that septic stimuli ( e.g. , lps , tnf- ) initiate activation of transcription factors such as nfb and ap-1 , resulting in transcriptional activation of multiple genes . this leads to the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. tnf- , il-1 etc ) , and increased expression of adhesion molecules ( e.g. e - selectin , icam-1 , vcam-1 ) and chemokines by endothelial cells [ 11 , 1719 ] . a key role of ros / rns in modulation of the endothelial cell pro - inflammatory phenotype has been highlighted previously ( fig . 1 ) . given the complexity of sirs and sepsis , it is perhaps not surprising that little progress has been made in improving outcome . efforts to block one or other component of the sepsis - associated inflammatory pathways have had little impact on patient survival . future advances in sepsis therapy will depend on improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology . in this review , we will focus on the early events in the response to septic stimuli of microvascular endothelial cells , the cell type that occurs in all organs . the endothelium provides a non - adhesive and anti - thrombotic surface for blood - born components , including circulating leukocytes . however , during sepsis , the microvascular endothelium is activated to a pro - adhesive and pro - thrombotic phenotype . in addition , septic endothelium becomes both a target and a source of ros and rns , and it thereby contributes to the onset of organ dysfunction [ 19 , 25 ] . clinically , sepsis is characterized by a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation . it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ; ( ii ) increased capillary permeability that manifests as', 'it frequently occurs after trauma , hemorrhage , burn or abdominal surgery , which cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . without timely and aggressive therapeutic intervention , sirs and sepsis remain the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide , with mortality rates ranging between 30 and 70% [ 4 , 5 ] . the initiating event in sepsis may be release of endotoxins ( i.e. , bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) ) from gram -

perfused capillaries in an animal model of sirs . apc also induces rearrangement of endothelial cells actin cytoskeleton and thereby stabilizes endothelial barrier function . indeed , therapeutic benefit of apc in sepsis may be largely due to augmentation of endothelial barrier function . unfortunately , any benefit from apc may be outweighed by adverse effects , especially an increased rate of hemorrhage . a recent cochrane review recommended that apc should not be given to patients at low risk of death or to pediatric patients . the review also concluded that the evidence supporting apc use in patients with severe sepsis and at high risk of death was very weak . however , chemical variants of apc have been synthesized that may retain therapeutic efficacy while reducing the risk of bleeding . experiments in mouse sepsis models , for example , show that survival is increased by a recombinant apc variant with normal cell signaling activity but < 10% anticoagulant activity . therefore , a therapy may be developed in future that treats septic patients with apc variants that have normal cell signaling but reduced anticoagulant activities . a second intervention that has been tested in critically ill patients is administration of the nonselective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl -

proteosome system . however , oxidants inhibit prolylhydroxylase activity and thereby allow hif-1 to dimerize with the hif-1 subunit . the dimerization activates hif-1 to translocate to the nucleus , bind dna and promote expression of inos and other inflammatory genes [ 6264 ] . sepsis is treated by controlling the source of infection , administering antimicrobial ( e.g. , antibiotic ) therapy , assuring hemodynamic support with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor drugs , inducing sedation or analgesia as needed ; and providing adequate nutrition . despite these interventions , approximately one -

How does nadph oxidase contribute to the pathophysiology of septic endothelium?,Nadph oxidase contributes to the pathophysiology of septic endothelium by synthesizing intracellular superoxide and initiating oxidative and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells.,"NADPH oxidase contributes to the pathophysiology of septic endothelium by synthesizing intracellular superoxide, which leads to the production of oxidants and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells. These oxidants cause endothelial barrier dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, nitration of tyrosine residues, and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Additionally, NADPH oxidase activity enhances the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in septic blood vessels and endothelial cells, resulting in the excess production of peroxynitrite. This oxidative and nitrosative stress leads to increased adhesion of leukocytes, platelets, and red blood cells to the endothelium, increased capillary permeability, and microvascular dysfunction.","['endothelium occurs in multiple organs during sepsis , leading to plasma extravasation and edema formation . this causes loss of blood volume and progression of septic shock ( i.e. , severe sepsis with hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation ) . basal nitric oxide production by enos is necessary for maintenance of the endothelial barrier function [ 4850 ] . the protective effect of nitric oxide is diminished during the inflammatory response due to the simultaneous production of superoxide . the source of this superoxide is likely the nadph oxidase that is co - localized with enos in subcellular compartments within endothelial cells . indeed , there is experimental evidence that nadph oxidase - derived ros mediate endothelial barrier failure . the latter causes lipid peroxidation , oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and nitration of tyrosine residues . in particular , nitration of cytoskeletal proteins by peroxynitrite appears to be a key step for endothelial barrier dysfunction [ 53 , 54 ] . the oxidants that arise from nadph oxidase activity ( e.g. , hydrogen peroxide formed by dismutation of superoxide ) exert prolonged redox signaling effects that enhance induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) in septic blood vessels and endothelial cells [ 33 , 37 , 52 , 5557 ] . inos synthesizes abundant nitric oxide that in turn reacts with superoxide resulting in an excess production of peroxynitrite . for instance , inos expression in omental arteries of septic patients is associated with a subnormal arteriolar response to norepinephrine that can be normalized by the non - selective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) . in addition , expression of the vascular adhesion molecule , e - selectin ( a marker of vascular pro - inflammatory phenotype ) is significantly abridged in the organs of inos - deficient mice challenged with lps ( fig . 2 ) . important to note , that interfering with production of peroxynitrite by pretreating cultured endothelial cells with the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron [ iii ] ( fetpps ) also reduces activation of nuclear factor nfb and subsequent up - regulation of nfb - dependent expression of e - selectin ( fig . the oxidants produced in endothelial cells during sepsis also induce expression of tissue factor [ 30 , 60 ] . this transmembrane glycoprotein ( formerly known as thromboplastin ) because endothelial', '( rotenone ) , xanthine oxidase ( allopurinol ) or nos ( l - name ) . longer incubation ( 12 h ) with lps + ifn increases nadph oxidase activity and nadph oxidase protein expression . increases in intracellular ros , whether caused by acute stimulation of nadph oxidase or by entry of extracellular ros , induce the expression of nadph oxidase subunits that subsequently assemble and produce more ros . dismutation of superoxide forms hydrogen peroxide and nitration of superoxide forms peroxynitrite . compared to superoxide , both hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite are strong oxidants and the latter is also a nitrosative stressor . thus , activation of nadph oxidase during sepsis induces oxidative and nitrosative stress in endothelial cells . normally endothelial cells regulate vascular smooth muscle tone by basal rates of production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( enos)-derived nitric oxide and prostaglandin endoperoxide h2 synthase-1 ( pghs)-1-derived prostacyclin ( pgi2 ) . nitric oxide directly enters the smooth muscle cell and activates soluble guanylyl cyclase , thereby raising intracellular cgmp . cgmp and camp then mediate smooth muscle relaxation . however , septic insult increases production of superoxide that reacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite that nitrates and inactivates endothelial pgi2 synthase , which can then no longer synthesize pgi2 . superoxide may also decrease the effective cellular level of nitric oxide below that required for guanylyl cyclase activation . nadph oxidase - derived oxidants ( i.e. , hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite ) oxidize tetrahydrobiopterin , which is a cofactor for synthesis of nitric oxide by nos enzymes [ 41 , 42 ] . the loss of tetrahydrobiopterin ( due to its oxidation ) uncouples enos , so that the enzyme synthesizes superoxide rather than nitric oxide . this is detrimental to blood flow in capillaries , which depends on nitric oxide synthesized locally by enos . further , ros activate intracellular redox signaling pathways to increase adhesion of leukocytes , platelets and red blood cells to the endothelium and thereby precipitate capillary blood flow cessation [ 4446 ] . increased permeability of the endothelium occurs in multiple organs during sepsis , leading to plasma extravasation and edema formation . this causes loss of blood volume and progression of septic shock ( i.e. , severe sepsis with hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation ) . basal nitric oxide production by enos is necessary for maintenance', 'a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation . it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ; ( ii ) increased capillary permeability that manifests as a breakdown of the microvascular endothelial barrier ; ( iii ) loss of the anti - adhesive function of endothelial surfaces ; ( iv ) coagulopathy ; ( v ) decreased density of perfused capillaries and elevated proportion of non - perfused capillaries , even in fluid - resuscitated patients with adequate arterial blood oxygenation and cardiac output [ 6 , 2633 ] . tissue hypoxia develops because the diffusion distance for oxygen increases between blood and tissue cells . this may explain why approximately one - third of patients with severe sepsis ( i.e. , sepsis with at least one organ failure or dysfunction ) die of organ failure even when shock is prevented by fluid resuscitation and administration of vasopressor drugs [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] . for example , superoxide is a ros that is synthesized in endothelial cells by the mitochondrial electron transport chain , xanthine oxidase , uncoupled nitric oxide synthases ( nos ) and nadph oxidases . bacterial bloodstream infection exposes endothelial cells to blood - borne endotoxins ( e.g. , e. coli lipopolysaccharide , lps ) and inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , interferon- , ifn ) . the cells respond to this septic insult by activating endothelial nadph oxidases that synthesize intracellular superoxide . indeed , nadph oxidase activity is the principal source for stimulated production of superoxide in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to septic insult [ 3638 ] . for example , in microvascular endothelial cell cultures , septic insult ( lps and ifn in combination ; lps + ifn ) increases superoxide levels within 2 h . nadph oxidase evidently is the principal source because the rise in superoxide levels is abolished by nadph oxidase inhibitors ( apocynin and diphenylene iodonium ) but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration ( rotenone ) , xanthine oxidase ( allopurinol ) or nos ( l - name ) . longer incubation ( 12 h ) with lps + ifn increases nadph oxidase activity and nadph oxidase protein expression . increases in intracellular ros , whether caused by acute stimulation of nadph oxidase', '- inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and may contribute to amplification of the inflammatory response [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] . in support to this hypothesis , it has been shown that septic stimuli ( e.g. , lps , tnf- ) initiate activation of transcription factors such as nfb and ap-1 , resulting in transcriptional activation of multiple genes . this leads to the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. tnf- , il-1 etc ) , and increased expression of adhesion molecules ( e.g. e - selectin , icam-1 , vcam-1 ) and chemokines by endothelial cells [ 11 , 1719 ] . a key role of ros / rns in modulation of the endothelial cell pro - inflammatory phenotype has been highlighted previously ( fig . 1 ) . given the complexity of sirs and sepsis , it is perhaps not surprising that little progress has been made in improving outcome . efforts to block one or other component of the sepsis - associated inflammatory pathways have had little impact on patient survival . future advances in sepsis therapy will depend on improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology . in this review , we will focus on the early events in the response to septic stimuli of microvascular endothelial cells , the cell type that occurs in all organs . the endothelium provides a non - adhesive and anti - thrombotic surface for blood - born components , including circulating leukocytes . however , during sepsis , the microvascular endothelium is activated to a pro - adhesive and pro - thrombotic phenotype . in addition , septic endothelium becomes both a target and a source of ros and rns , and it thereby contributes to the onset of organ dysfunction [ 19 , 25 ] . clinically , sepsis is characterized by a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation . it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium -

What is the role of activated protein C (APC) in septic patients?,"Activated protein C (APC) stabilizes endothelial barrier function, which may largely contribute to its therapeutic benefit in sepsis.","The role of activated protein C (APC) in septic patients is to improve microvascular function and stabilize endothelial barrier function. It can decrease the adherence of leukocytes to arteriolar and venular endothelium and increase the density of blood-perfused capillaries.

However, the use of APC in septic patients is still under debate due to potential adverse effects, such as an increased rate of hemorrhage.","['and cardiac output [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] . further , survival is improved by treatments that improve microvascular function ( e.g. , antioxidants , inos deficiency , and tissue factor pathway inhibitor ) in animal models of polymicrobial sepsis [ 33 , 6770 ] . several potential therapies that target septic microvascular dysfunction are discussed next . the administration of activated protein c ( apc ) to septic patients is a recently introduced therapy . further , the adherence of leukocytes to arteriolar and venular endothelium is strongly diminished by activated protein c infusion , which is associated with an increased density of blood - perfused capillaries in an animal model of sirs . apc also induces rearrangement of endothelial cells actin cytoskeleton and thereby stabilizes endothelial barrier function . indeed , therapeutic benefit of apc in sepsis may be largely due to augmentation of endothelial barrier function . unfortunately , any benefit from apc may be outweighed by adverse effects , especially an increased rate of hemorrhage . a recent cochrane review recommended that apc should not be given to patients at low risk of death or to pediatric patients . the review also concluded that the evidence supporting apc use in patients with severe sepsis and at high risk of death was very weak . however , chemical variants of apc have been synthesized that may retain therapeutic efficacy while reducing the risk of bleeding . experiments in mouse sepsis models , for example , show that survival is increased by a recombinant apc variant with normal cell signaling activity but < 10% anticoagulant activity . therefore , a therapy may be developed in future that treats septic patients with apc variants that have normal cell signaling but reduced anticoagulant activities . a second intervention that has been tested in critically ill patients is administration of the nonselective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) . a phase iii clinical trial of l - nmma in patients with septic shock was terminated early because of increased mortality , but post hoc analysis indicated an overall survival benefit for low - dose l - nmma . the adverse effect of high - dose l - nmma may have been due to inhibition of the enos necessary for microvascular homeostasis . vitamin c injection is also a candidate therapy [ 26 ,', '- inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and may contribute to amplification of the inflammatory response [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] . in support to this hypothesis , it has been shown that septic stimuli ( e.g. , lps , tnf- ) initiate activation of transcription factors such as nfb and ap-1 , resulting in transcriptional activation of multiple genes . this leads to the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. tnf- , il-1 etc ) , and increased expression of adhesion molecules ( e.g. e - selectin , icam-1 , vcam-1 ) and chemokines by endothelial cells [ 11 , 1719 ] . a key role of ros / rns in modulation of the endothelial cell pro - inflammatory phenotype has been highlighted previously ( fig . 1 ) . given the complexity of sirs and sepsis , it is perhaps not surprising that little progress has been made in improving outcome . efforts to block one or other component of the sepsis - associated inflammatory pathways have had little impact on patient survival . future advances in sepsis therapy will depend on improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology . in this review , we will focus on the early events in the response to septic stimuli of microvascular endothelial cells , the cell type that occurs in all organs . the endothelium provides a non - adhesive and anti - thrombotic surface for blood - born components , including circulating leukocytes . however , during sepsis , the microvascular endothelium is activated to a pro - adhesive and pro - thrombotic phenotype . in addition , septic endothelium becomes both a target and a source of ros and rns , and it thereby contributes to the onset of organ dysfunction [ 19 , 25 ] . clinically , sepsis is characterized by a severe microvascular dysfunction that persists despite fluid resuscitation . it has been suggested that microvascular dysfunction under septic conditions is closely related to : ( i ) arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators , including endothelium - dependent vasodilators ; ( ii ) increased capillary permeability that manifests as', 'it frequently occurs after trauma , hemorrhage , burn or abdominal surgery , which cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . without timely and aggressive therapeutic intervention , sirs and sepsis remain the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide , with mortality rates ranging between 30 and 70% [ 4 , 5 ] . the initiating event in sepsis may be release of endotoxins ( i.e. , bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) ) from gram - negative and gram - positive pathogenic bacteria . lps triggers activation of inflammatory cells , such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( neutrophils ; pmn ) , monocytes / macrophages and lymphocytes . it is generally agreed that it is not the bacterial infection itself , but rather the inflammatory response to infection that is the predominant determinant of outcome in sepsis [ 7 , 8 ] . one of the key features of sepsis is tissue infiltration by phagocytic cells [ 913 ] . in this scenario , pmn and monocytes / macrophages respond to septic stimulation by producing reactive oxygen species ( ros ) ( e.g. , superoxide , hydrogen peroxide ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) ( e.g. , nitric oxide ) . in addition , pmn release granular enzymes ( e.g. elastase , cathepsin ) and the myeloperoxidase ( mpo)-derived oxidant , hypochlorous acid ( hocl ) . all these components may contribute to pmn / macrophage - mediated killing of the bacteria . however , if produced in excess during sirs and sepsis , the ros , rns and proteolytic enzymes cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction ( fig . 1 ) . an inflammatory response to septic stimuli is crucial for host defense , because it up - regulates anti - inflammatory mediators ( e.g. , il-1 receptor antagonist , il-4 , il-10 ) and antioxidant enzymes ( e.g. , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , manganese superoxide dismutase ) . however , excessive production of pro - inflammatory mediators in sepsis overwhelms the anti - inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and', 'factor nfb and subsequent up - regulation of nfb - dependent expression of e - selectin ( fig . the oxidants produced in endothelial cells during sepsis also induce expression of tissue factor [ 30 , 60 ] . this transmembrane glycoprotein ( formerly known as thromboplastin ) because endothelial cells and monocytes do not express tissue factor under physiological conditions , there is no appreciable contact of cellular tissue factor with the circulating blood . however , these cells do express tissue factor when exposed to inflammatory cytokines and this response contributes to coagulopathy in sepsis . when tissue factor is exposed to blood , it forms a high - affinity complex with coagulation factors , leading to the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot . coagulation is activated rapidly after septic insult and results in diffuse microvascular clot formation that may disrupt blood flow in capillary beds [ 28 , 30 , 60 ] . nadph oxidase - derived oxidants also stimulate the activation of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) in endothelial cells . normally the hif-1 subunit has a short half - life because it is covalently modified by hif-1 prolylhydroxylase , which targets hif-1 for proteolysis by the ubiquitin - proteosome system . however , oxidants inhibit prolylhydroxylase activity and thereby allow hif-1 to dimerize with the hif-1 subunit . the dimerization activates hif-1 to translocate to the nucleus , bind dna and promote expression of inos and other inflammatory genes [ 6264 ] . sepsis is treated by controlling the source of infection , administering antimicrobial ( e.g. , antibiotic ) therapy , assuring hemodynamic support with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor drugs , inducing sedation or analgesia as needed ;

dose l - nmma . the adverse effect of high - dose l - nmma may have been due to inhibition of the enos necessary for microvascular homeostasis . vitamin c injection is also a candidate therapy [ 26 , 78 , 79 ] . in a randomized , prospective , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial with 226 critically ill patients , 28-day survival was increased in the patients who received combined vitamin c and vitamin e by i.v . another large , randomized , prospective trial demonstrated decreased incidence of organ failure and shortened icu stay for critically ill patients who began receiving i.v . injections of combined vitamin c ( 3 g / day for up to 28 days ) and vitamin e within 24 h of traumatic injury or major surgery . yet another randomized , prospective study reported decreased morbidity for severely burned patients who were infused with an even higher dose of vitamin c ( 1584 studies of animal models have shown that vitamin c prevents lps - induced edema and hypotension [ 83 , 84 ] , prolongs survival in experimental bacteremia , and improves arteriolar responsiveness , arterial blood pressure , capillary blood flow , liver function and survival in experimental sepsis [ 26 , 3133 , 86 ] . therefore , the biological plausibility of this intervention is discussed further in the following paragraphs . ascorbate functions as an antioxidant and enzyme cofactor , becoming oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid ( dhaa ) in the process . sirs and sepsis lower plasma ascorbate concentration [ 26 , 31 , 8790 ] . injection i.v . of vitamin c can increase the amount of ascorbate delivered to endothelial cells to a greater extent than can oral ingestion . as depicted in fig . 4 , ascorbate is transported into microvascular endothelial cells by the specific transporter svct2 , while dhaa is taken up through facilitative glucose transporters ( glut ) and then reduced to ascorbate [ 79 , 9193 ] . the intracellular concentrations of ascorbate thus achieved are 416 mm [ 37 , 94 ] . this intracellular ascorbate may protect microvascular function in two phases of action : initially by inhibiting nadph oxidase activation and increasing enos activity , and subsequently by suppressing expression of nadph oxidase , inos', 'and cardiac output [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] . further , survival is improved by treatments that improve microvascular function ( e.g. , antioxidants , inos deficiency , and tissue factor pathway inhibitor ) in animal models of polymicrobial sepsis [ 33 , 6770 ] . several potential therapies that target septic microvascular dysfunction are discussed next . the administration of activated protein c ( apc ) to septic patients is a recently introduced therapy . further , the adherence of leukocytes to arteriolar and venular endothelium is strongly diminished by activated protein c infusion , which is associated with an increased density of blood - perfused capillaries in an animal model of sirs . apc also induces rearrangement of endothelial cells actin cytoskeleton and thereby stabilizes endothelial barrier function . indeed , therapeutic benefit of apc in sepsis may be largely due to augmentation of endothelial barrier function . unfortunately , any benefit from apc may be outweighed by adverse effects , especially an increased rate of hemorrhage . a recent cochrane review recommended that apc should not be given to patients at low risk of death or to pediatric patients . the review also concluded that the evidence supporting apc use in patients with severe sepsis and at high risk of death was very weak . however , chemical variants of apc have been synthesized that may retain therapeutic efficacy while reducing the risk of bleeding . experiments in mouse sepsis models , for example , show that survival is increased by a recombinant apc variant with normal cell signaling activity but < 10% anticoagulant activity . therefore , a therapy may be developed in future that treats septic patients with apc variants that have normal cell signaling but reduced anticoagulant activities . a second intervention that has been tested in critically ill patients is administration of the nonselective nos inhibitor n(g)-methyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) . a phase iii clinical trial of l - nmma in patients with septic shock was terminated early because of increased mortality , but post hoc analysis indicated an overall survival benefit for low - dose l - nmma . the adverse effect of high - dose l - nmma may have been due to inhibition of the enos necessary for microvascular homeostasis . vitamin c injection is also a candidate therapy [ 26 ,', 'the intracellular concentrations of ascorbate thus achieved are 416 mm [ 37 , 94 ] . this intracellular ascorbate may protect microvascular function in two phases of action : initially by inhibiting nadph oxidase activation and increasing enos activity , and subsequently by suppressing expression of nadph oxidase , inos and tissue factor ( fig . ascorbate in endothelial cells prevents tetrahydrobiopterin oxidation , increases tetrahydrobiopterin content and elevates synthesis of nitric oxide by enos [ 95 , 96 ] . studies of endotoxin induced shock indicate that inos inhibition has little or no beneficial effect in the presence of a failing enos system , because some nitric oxide is needed to maintain adequate organ function . an antioxidant role for vitamin c is supported by the observation that ascorbate abrogates stimulation by septic insult of superoxide production in microvascular endothelial cells . intracellular concentrations of ascorbate inside cells are high enough to prevent the reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide that creates peroxynitrite and to re - reduce the oxidation products that peroxynitrite creates when it reacts with cellular components . intracellular ascorbate blocks induction by lps + ifn or hydrogen peroxide of endothelial nadph oxidase activity , nadph oxidase protein expression and inos protein expression [ 37 , 55 , 56 , 100 ] . also diminishes inos mrna expression in microvascular endothelial cells and arterioles in an in vivo model of sepsis [ 32 , 33 ] . ascorbate is required for the optimal activity of the proline and asparagine hydroxylases that control the transcription factor hif-1 . expression of hif-1 sensitive genes , such as inos , is similarly inhibited by ascorbate [ 32 , 33 , 102 ] . injection of 2 g vitamin c in human subjects does not alter superoxide production by neutrophils . similarly , incubation of neutrophils with either ascorbic acid or dhaa , to raise intracellular ascorbate concentration , does not inhibit the production of extracellular ros elicited when these cells are subsequently challenged by inflammatory stimuli such as e. coli [ 103 , 104 ] . there is cause for concern about potential adverse effects of high - dose vitamin c injections . under certain conditions in vitro , ascorbic acid donates electrons to transition metals ( e.g. iron ) that then catalyze the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide [ 105 , 106 ] . is not followed by elevation', 'it frequently occurs after trauma , hemorrhage , burn or abdominal surgery , which cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . without timely and aggressive therapeutic intervention , sirs and sepsis remain the prime causes of death in intensive care units worldwide , with mortality rates ranging between 30 and 70% [ 4 , 5 ] . the initiating event in sepsis may be release of endotoxins ( i.e. , bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) ) from gram - negative and gram - positive pathogenic bacteria . lps triggers activation of inflammatory cells , such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( neutrophils ; pmn ) , monocytes / macrophages and lymphocytes . it is generally agreed that it is not the bacterial infection itself , but rather the inflammatory response to infection that is the predominant determinant of outcome in sepsis [ 7 , 8 ] . one of the key features of sepsis is tissue infiltration by phagocytic cells [ 913 ] . in this scenario , pmn and monocytes / macrophages respond to septic stimulation by producing reactive oxygen species ( ros ) ( e.g. , superoxide , hydrogen peroxide ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) ( e.g. , nitric oxide ) . in addition , pmn release granular enzymes ( e.g. elastase , cathepsin ) and the myeloperoxidase ( mpo)-derived oxidant , hypochlorous acid ( hocl ) . all these components may contribute to pmn / macrophage - mediated killing of the bacteria . however , if produced in excess during sirs and sepsis , the ros , rns and proteolytic enzymes cause microvascular dysfunction followed by organ dysfunction ( fig . 1 ) . an inflammatory response to septic stimuli is crucial for host defense , because it up - regulates anti - inflammatory mediators ( e.g. , il-1 receptor antagonist , il-4 , il-10 ) and antioxidant enzymes ( e.g. , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , manganese superoxide dismutase ) . however , excessive production of pro - inflammatory mediators in sepsis overwhelms the anti - inflammatory signaling . this results in suppression of innate immune functions ( especially those of pmn ) and leads to immunoparalysis and subsequently to increased susceptibility to infection . it is important to note that , besides immune cells , microvascular endothelial cells also become activated in sepsis and']"

old man with a weight of 65 kg and a height of 172 cm visited with a chief complaint of a 2-month - history of a mass in the left inguinal area . the patient was diagnosed with a left inguinal hernia and then he was hospitalized for laparoscopic tep hernia repair . normal findings were seen on the preoperative chest radiography , the ekg and the pulmonary function tests ( fig . the patient was premedicated with midazolam 2 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly 30 minutes before anesthesia . following arrival at the operation room , the blood pressure was 150/90 mmhg , the heart rate was 85 times / min and the peripheral o2 saturation was 98% . for the induction of anesthesia , thiopental sodium 300 mg and rocuronium 40 mg were given intravenously , and this was followed by tracheal intubation . there were no problems during endotracheal intubation . following confirmation that there were no problems with ventilation in both lungs , a tube was fixed in the area that was 23 cm away from the incisor . the anesthesia was maintained with o2 2.0 l / min , air 2.0 l / min , desflurane 4 - 6 vol% and remifentanil 0.3 - 0.5 g / min / kg . following the induction of anesthesia , mechanical ventilation was initiated at a tidal volume of 8 ml / kg and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths / min , which produced a peak airway pressure of 17 - 18 mmhg . at the start of surgery , the end - tidal co2 was 32 mmhg , the peripheral o2 saturation was 99 - 100% , the blood pressure was 110/70 mmhg and the heart rate was 85 times / min', 'discussion on the complications associated with the management of anesthesia during laparoscopic surgery . pneumothorax is one of the serious complications , although it rarely occurs in association with laparoscopic surgery . yet in cases of laparoscopic tep hernia repair , surgical procedures such as the insufflation of co2 or the insertion of laparoscopic ports themselves are restricted to the extraperitoneal space . however , its prevalence is likely to increase as the procedure continues to gain popularity . a few cases in the anesthesia literature describes that laparoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repair having been complicated by pneumothorax without hemodynamic instability and/or subcutaneous emphysema [ 5 - 8 ] . in our case , the patient developed intraoperatively pneumothorax with hemodynamic instability . in cases of pneumothorax occurring during general anesthesia , such non - surgically related complications as barotrauma , damage to the bronchus during endotracheal intubation , rupture of congenital bulla or blebs , and side effects due to the insertion of a central venous catheter a central venous catheter was not inserted and an excessive extent of positive pressure ventilation was not performed . accordingly , the complications of this case were assumed to have occurred in association with the surgical procedure . based on the findings that the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters improved when the insufflation of co2 gas was discontinued , the occurrence of pneumothorax due to a non - surgical cause could be ruled out . for the current case , the first was that co2 entered the retroperitoneal space and then it entered the pleural space and mediastinum along the tissue plane . this might be consistent with the pathway for which the subcutaneous emphysema occurred in the neck and upper chest area in the current case . chien et al . reported on three patients who developed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and laryngopharyngeal areas . a hypothesis for the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema is that co2 enters the retroperitoneal space through a myopectineal dissection and then it reaches the neck . accordingly , it has been reported that setting the insufflation pressure of co2 below 10 mmhg and keeping the insufflation time below 2 hours are helpful for preventing pneumothorax . shim et al . reported that pneumothorax was occurred during retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy because insufflations pressures were over 15 mmhg . in the current case , the insufflation pressure was 12', 'bilateral submental regions , the shoulder and the upper thoracic area . but under the suspicion of pneumothorax in the right lung , a prompt resolution of the pneumoperitoneum was requested prior to further aggravating the condition of the patient . the surgical procedure was completed 15 minutes after the request to halt the pneumoperitoneum . with the resolution of the pneumoperitoneum , the peak airway pressure decreased to 21 cmh2o and the end - tidal co2 decreased to 37 mmhg . a chest ap x - ray was performed and this confirmed the occurrence of pneumothorax in the right lung ( fig . the arterial blood gas analysis showed a ph of 7.34 , a paco2 of 44 mmhg , a pao2 of 389 mmhg and a sao2 of 99% . this was followed by removing the endotracheal tube . except for the pain at the site of surgery , the patient did not complain of respiratory distress . using an oxygen mask , oxygen 5 l / min was administered to the patient . following the surgery , the disappearance of pneumothorax was confirmed on the chest x - ray that was performed again in a recovery room ( fig . a chest x - ray on the third post - operative day showed no abnormal findings , and the chest tube was removed . there is a trend that laparoscopic tep inguinal hernia repair is now being performed as an alternative to traditional open repair or laparoscopic transabominal preperitoneal hernia repair . in particular , laparoscopic tep hernia repair is a method that is favored for patients with recurrent or bilateral hernias . the advantages of laparoscopic tep inguinal hernia repair include a low recurrence rate and a reduced risk of intraabdominal infection or contamination , and damage to the intra - abdominal organs and adhesion , as compared with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair or an open procedure . it also causes less postoperative pain and it enables patients to promptly return to their daily lives [ 2 - 4 ] . there has been extensive discussion on the complications associated with the management of anesthesia during laparoscopic surgery . pneumothorax is one of the serious complications , although it rarely occurs in association with laparoscopic surgery . yet in cases of laparoscopic tep hernia repair , surgical procedures such as the insufflation of co2 or', 'pregnancy induced hypertension , coagulation disorders , placenta previa , heart disease and multiple pregnancies were excluded . totally 100 patients were studied with the indications for lscs being : previous lscs-24 , previous 2 lscs-11 , oligohydramnios-10 , post -

tailed testing . the need for surgery , occurrence of rebleeding , and need for transfusion were analysed as secondary outcomes . the study was conducted in a single regional hospital ( waikato hospital , hamilton , new zealand ) between 23rd february 2001 and 12 october 2010 . for all patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at presentation to the hospital or during an admission for a different condition , the following were recorded prospectively in a dedicated upper gastrointestinal bleed database : presenting features , endoscopic diagnosis , presence of stigmata of recent hemorrhage ( including forrest classification of peptic ulceration ) 6 7 and administered treatment . those patients with evidence of variceal bleeding were excluded from the analysis . when a patient had more than one episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage during the study period , only the first event was included . additional clinical and laboratory data at presentation were retrospectively collected through review of the clinical record . data regarding the use of prothrombinex ( pooled purified human coagulation factors ii , ix , and x ; csl ltd , broadmeadows , australia ) , fresh frozen plasma , and platelet and packed red cell transfusion were obtained from a national transfusion database . all patients taking warfarin who had an inr of 3 or higher were included in a supratherapeutic anticoagulation ( sa ) group . the optmatch package in r 8 was used to match these patients to a control group of patients taken from the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage database who were not taking warfarin at presentation . patients were matched for age , sex , pre - endoscopy rockall score , year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage , inpatient or outpatient status , and the presence of disseminated cancer at presentation . the year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was analysed as a dichotomous variable , with patients recorded as having had an episode of bleeding in either the first or the second half of the study period . patients were matched for year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to ensure that changes in referral patterns or in clinical management over the study period did not contribute bias to the outcome . patients were not well matched on age and presence of disseminated cancer at presentation if the rockall score alone was used as a', 'recurrence - free survival ( ivrfs ) rates were estimated by the kaplan - meier method and evaluated with the use of the log - rank test . clinicopathologic factors in each group were compared by use of the or kruskal - wallis test . statistical significance was set at p < .05 , and statistical tests were performed with jmp software , version 10.0.0 ( sas institute , cary , north carolina ) . the characteristics of the patients who underwent onu , halnu , and lnu are shown in table 1 . there was no significant difference in age , tumor site , pt stage , tumor grade , or lymphovascular invasion among the 3 groups . the pluck technique was more frequently selected in halnu patients , followed by lnu patients in this order ( p < .0001 ) . table 2 shows perioperative data , including the operative time , blood loss , time to discharge , and postoperative aes , for each surgical approach . the amount of blood loss was significantly smaller in lnu and halnu patients than in onu patients ( p < .0001 ) . the patients who underwent lnu had a shorter hospital stay than those who underwent onu or halnu ( p < .0001 ) . there was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative aes among the groups . in the onu group , 3 cases of wound dehiscence , 1 case of ileus , and 1 postoperative hemorrhage greater than grade 3 were observed . the aes of grade 3 or greater in the halnu group were 1 kidney infection and 1 case of hypotension . in the lnu group , 5 patients had postoperative aes of grade 3 or greater , including 3 cases of wound dehiscence , 1 postoperative hemorrhage , 1 kidney infection , 1 lung infection , and 1 increase in creatinine level . figures 2 , 3 , and 4 present kaplan - meier estimates of css , rfs , and ivrfs , respectively , in each group . the 5-year css rates of patients who underwent onu , halnu , and lnu were 74.2% , 72.9% , and 87.4% , respectively ( p = .5611 ) . the 5-year rfs rates were 57.1% in the onu group , 12.5% in the halnu group , and 69.2% in the lnu group (', 'compared with onu . in a meta - analysis of studies comparing halnu with lnu , there were no significant differences in the operative time , the length of stay , or the risks of perioperative transfusion or complications , but halnu was associated with significantly less operative blood loss and risk of open conversion than lnu . another study with a small series and a short - term follow - up period showed no difference in oncologic outcomes between lnu and halnu . thus most studies reported the equivalence or superiority of halnu compared with onu or lnu . however , a large multicenter study showed that halnu was an independent risk factor for intravesical recurrence compared with lnu , like this study . in our study the difference in ivrfs among the 3 surgical techniques was larger than that for all rfs because the first recurrence site was the bladder in all patients who underwent halnu and had a recurrence during follow - up . we excluded patients with unresectable or metastatic tumors because minimally invasive surgery is not recommended for advanced uutuc . to avoid contamination causing recurrence of bladder cancer itself other than intravesical recurrence of uutuc , we also excluded patients with a history of bladder cancer or concomitant bladder cancer . in these circumstances , because early ligation of the ureter was not performed during rnu in our series , even in onu and lnu patients , we think that the hand manipulation during halnu might release cancer cells into the urinary tract and those cells might be seeded in the bladder mucosa . this may mean that inexperience in using laparoscopic procedures was associated with a higher incidence of intravesical recurrence . first , this was a retrospective study with selection biases and a small number of patients , especially in the halnu group , at a single institute . to determine the differences in the incidences of intravesical recurrence among onu , halnu , and lnu patients , a prospective randomized trial is needed . we found that there was no significant difference in css among onu , halnu , and lnu patients but that rfs and ivrfs in halnu patients were inferior to those in onu and lnu patients . lnu and halnu were associated with diminished blood loss , which is compatible with the results of previous studies . patients', 'p=.048 ) and for os ( hr , 4.291 ; 95% ci , 1.012 to 17.724 ; p= .043 ) ( table 2 ) . two or more sites of extranodal involvement was an independent prognostic factor ( hr , 2.768 ; 95% ci , 1.028 to 7.571 ; p=.047 ) for efs but it was not of prognostic relevance with regard to os ( p=.098 ) . ecog performance status ( ecog ps ) 2 ( p=.125 ) and presence of b symptoms ( p=.095 ) were not found to be in correlation with os in multivariate analysis . the prognostic significance of the traditional clinicopathologic parameters of dlbcl seems to be overshadowed by the introduction of r - chop as a standard regimen for dlbcl [ 8 - 10 ] . bcl-2 expression assessed by immunohistochemical staining seems to be no longer associated with a poor outcome in dlbcl patients treated with r - chop . in addition , the prognostic value of immunophenotypic subtype determined by immunohistochemistry for cd10 , bcl-6 , and mum1 is questioned in rituximab era . furthermore , the predictive significance of international prognostic index that has been the most important prognostic factor for dlbcl in pre - rituximab era also seems to be overridden by the addition of rituximab to chop regimen . when assessed semi - quantitatively using flow cytometry ( fcm ) analysis , the levels of cd20 expression in the fresh tissue sample were quite heterogeneous both among and within different types of non - hodgkin b - cell lymphomas . in addition , the level of cd20 expression at the onset of disease seems to be an independent predictor for poor outcomes in patients treated with r - chop . fcm analysis of fresh tissue sample , however , is not a routine practice in many institutions with limited resources . accordingly , immunohistochemical assessment of cd20 expression in diagnostic tissue samples in forms of paraffin blocks should be a more feasible method both in terms of low cost and convenience in sample recruitment . there has been no previous literature specific to the distribution of immunohistochemical levels of cd20 expression in the diagnostic ffpet samples of dlbcl and their association with the prognosis of the patients . in this study , we used a free web -

What type of hypersensitivity reaction can Anisakis simplex cause in humans?,"Anisakis simplex can cause a clinically relevant IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction with acute urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis.","Anisakis simplex can cause an acute type 1 hypersensitivity reaction in humans, leading to symptoms such as acute urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis.","['anisakis simplex is a fish parasite of worldwide distribution , whose third stage larva can be present in a huge number of marine teleost fishes . humans can therefore be accidental hosts by consuming crude or undercooked fish . whereas ige production is an evolutionary - maintained immunologic feature in mammals and thus can also be verified in all cases of human parasitic forms by this nematode , the allergenic potential has been an emerging health concern in the last years , giving rise to a large number of studies searching for proteins able to stimulate a specific ige response [ 2 , 3 ] . gastroallergic anisakiasis has been described as a differential entity , where an acute parasitism by a. simplex produces also a clinically relevant ige - mediated hypersensitivity reaction with appearance of acute urticaria , angioedema , or anaphylaxis . it is well known that , in gaa , specific as well as total ige and other specific immunoglobulin isotype levels depend upon the time interval elapsed ( ti ) between the acute parasitic episode and the obtaining of the serum sample . the parasite is not adapted to the human environment and neither survives nor moults to its final stage . even if the parasitic episode is always short - lived for mainly some hours , but maximally for a few days , as has been documented by gastroscopic findings in gaa , the immune stimulation , as witnessed by its humoral response , reaches its peak after four to six weeks and ige is detectable in human sera or can be shown by skin prick tests ( spt ) for more than ten years . another clinical entity , where a previous acute parasitic episode is suspected to play at least a necessary factor in a disease of multifactorial genesis , has been proposed to be an anisakis sensitization - associated chronic urticaria ( cu+ ) and has been described as a different phenotype of urticaria with distinct clinical as well as immunologic features with respect to other chronic urticaria forms , but also compared to gaa [ 69 ] . furthermore , association of chronic urticaria with a. simplex hypersensitivity is now reported from different geographic regions . therefore , even if current bibliography shows chronic urticaria to have a frequent autoimmune or idiopathic origin , the search for underlying causes or associations', 'application in human allergic disease are still a matter of debate [ 14 , 27 ] . the specific affinity maturation in anisakis - associated allergic disease has not been studied so far , but our results could lead to a testable hypothesis , where clinically different cu+ and gaa after parasitism could be motivated by distinct class switching of specific antibodies . in this first study on immunoglobulin avidities in humans affected by a. simplex parasitism , we could thus show a differential behaviour of immunoglobulin isotype avidities in gaa and cu+ and their dependence on fish - eating habits as well as on the time elapsed to the last parasitic episode . further studies should address avidity studies against excretory - secretory proteins as well as affinity studies against known allergens .', 'allergic episode , leads to maintaining lower affinity antibodies . this would be an explanation to the fact that patients sensitized to anisakis do not react with acute type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in provocation tests with non viable anisakis larvae [ 28 , 29 ] . furthermore , blocking antibodies , such as igg4 included in the igg compartment , with confirmed higher avidities in gaa could , by competing with the same epitopes recognized by ige , prevent mast cell activation and the subsequent allergic episode , when anisakis contaminated fish ( nonviable or inactivated larvae ) is well tolerated by patients with previous gaa . interestingly , if we look at the diverging correlation of avigg and avige with specific ige , we can also postulate that avidity is not only the outcome of an affinity maturation process of antibodies within an antibody isotype , but also the outcome of a mechanism , in which probably outcompeting of an immunoglobulin isotype over another could have been resulted by high - affinity antibodies in the maturation process . a possible drawback of these results is of methodological concern , as there could be some controversy about the influence of igg antibodies on an elisa assay in avidity studies . however , previous studies with using thiocyanate as denaturing agent showed independence of immunoglobulin levels and avidity and lack of independence between avidity indexes and immunoglobulin concentrations [ 26 , 31 ] . therefore , our finding of a negative correlation of specific ige with avidity is not expected to be influenced by a methodological constraint . we did not show a direct negative correlation between avige and avigg , but this could be due to the fact that we did not measure differential epitope affinity and the high variation of binding capacities and maturation process of antibodies between individuals . in this respect it is interesting to note that differences in the generation of high - affinity ige antibodies could be due to differences in sequential class switching versus direct class switching from igm , although animal models and application in human allergic disease are still a matter of debate [ 14 , 27 ] . the specific affinity maturation in anisakis - associated allergic disease has not been studied so far , but our results could lead to a testable hypothesis , where clinically different cu+ and gaa', 'associated allergic diseases is to assess hypothesized differences in avidity in gaa and cu+ and to associate them with the time interval elapsed since the parasitic episode and also with fish -

What are the main factors contributing to ige avidity in GAA according to the regression analysis in the study?,The time interval between the acute parasitic episode and obtaining the serum sample was the main contributing factor for IgE avidity in GAA.,The main factor contributing to ige avidity in GAA according to the regression analysis in the study is the time interval.,"['h2 . in our present study all but one patient showed a higher avige than avigg ( avige / avigg ratio > 1 ; data not shown ) , a fact that does not rule out opposite findings if we would have available affinity studies with known allergens . whereas all immunoglobulin isotypes are known to be lower in cu+ than in gaa , a fact we could also confirm for specific igg in our study , avidities could also be interpreted when analysing the time interval between parasitism and obtaining of the serum sample . likewise , regression analysis showed that , in gaa , time interval was the main explaining factor for ige avidity . affinity is overall expected to rise in time after infection , but this probably applies to only a few relevant allergens or epitopes . a possible explanation for our results could be drawn from the correlation studies depicted in figures 2 and 3 . polyclonal stimulation after an acute parasitic episode leads to high immunoglobulin levels , and in the case of ige , most ige does not recognize anisakis proteins [ 2 , 13 ] . even if we only focus on specific ige production , a mixture of high - affinity and low - affinity antibodies is to be expected . as antibody levels continuously fall again after a peak at about one month , low - affinity ige antibodies seem here to turn up over high - affinity antibodies resulting in overall lower avidity . there is still controversy about the beneficial role of low - affinity ige antibodies . according to xiong et al . these can compete with high - affinity ige for binding to high - affinity ige receptors and prevent anaphylaxis in atopic allergy . otherwise this possibility has been stated unlikely because very high levels of ige are needed to adequately saturate ige receptors . also in this case we could speculate that , once a sensitization process has occurred , following continuous contact with anisakis proteins of other specificities than those leading to the allergic episode , leads to maintaining lower affinity antibodies . this would be an explanation to the fact that patients sensitized to anisakis do not react with acute type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in provocation tests with non viable anisakis larvae [ 28 , 29 ] . furthermore , blocking antibodies', 'median avige in all patients was 80.3 ( interquartile range 73.291.8 ) , while median avigg was 53.9 ( 37.491.8 ) . igg avidity was higher in gaa than in cu+ ( p = 0.035 ) , whereas there was a tendency to lower ige avidity in gaa ( p = 0.095 ) . when analysing all patients , avigg was positively correlated with specific ige , igg , and igg4 as well as total ige ( rho between 0.66 and 0.71 ; p < 0.002 ) , but avige was negatively correlated with specific ige ( rho 0.57 ; p < 0.001 ) , specific igg4 ( rho 0.38 ; p < 0.05 ) , and total ige ( rho 0.66 ; p < 0.001 ) . this divergent correlation depending on avige or avigg was mainly maintained when patients with gaa were analysed ( figures 1 and 2 ) . here , a further negative correlation between avige and time interval could be stated ( rho 0.71 ; p = 0.02 ) . also , in gaa weekly fish consumption was positively associated with avige ( rho 0.51 ; p = 0.05 ) . linear regression showed that time interval ( p = 0.015 ) was the main explaining factor for avige in gaa ( table 2 and figure 3 ) . overall , we show high avidities for specific ige and moderate avidities for specific igg against a. simplex in both studied groups . most avidity studies have been performed in order to search for differentiating recent versus chronic infections [ 1719 ] . when analysing our patients , we have to take into account that the positive skin prick test or the presence of specific ige denotes a past infection by the parasite , which is always self - limiting and therefore acute . moreover , in order to have an allergic reaction accompanying the acute gastric parasitism , as in the case of our gaa patients , they obligatorily had a previous sensitizing episode . in our cu+ , we do not know the time of the last parasitic episode , but lower ige values as demonstrated in the present as well as previous studies indicate a longer time interval to the last episode [ 8 , 24 ] . thus , it is to be expected that relevant antibodies had sufficient time to affinity', 'of the last parasitic episode , but lower ige values as demonstrated in the present as well as previous studies indicate a longer time interval to the last episode [ 8 , 24 ] . thus , it is to be expected that relevant antibodies had sufficient time to affinity maturation . whereas in chronic infection , such as by toxocara or toxoplasma , the continuous contact with antigens facilitates affinity maturation [ 18 , 23 ] , there remains however the question about the source of antigen or allergen for affinity maturation in the case of rarely occurring acute episodes of parasitism such as by a. simplex . in a previous a. simplex infection model in rats , previous studies showed that most patients with cu+ really had a past infection with a. simplex , which is supported also by high ige avidities . we have no data on avidities after a primary infection with a. simplex in humans , as these are expected to behave subclinically or induce only gastrointestinal , but no allergic symptoms . it may be argued that in gaa at least two episodes , as proposed above , would be sufficient to induce in the second episode a higher maturation of antibodies in the context of a secondary response , but the otherwise longer time interval in cu+ could be responsible for the slightly higher ige avidities . whereas avidity describes the overall strength of the interaction between antibodies and their antigens , it would therefore be interesting to perform a similar study analysing affinities to already known anisakis proteins or allergens . our avidity results could be interpreted as a subset of clinically relevant ige for the acute parasitism and a set of ige antibodies induced by continuous fish intake ( and therefore anisakis contact ) with possibly different avidities . in this respect , a previous study in peanut allergic subjects showed ige : igg avidity ratios to be higher than 1 for a total antigenic source , whereas the opposite ratio was found when analysing avidity to a major allergen ara h2 . in our present study all but one patient showed a higher avige than avigg ( avige / avigg ratio > 1 ;

affinity and low - affinity antibodies is to be expected . as antibody levels continuously fall again after a peak at about one month , low - affinity ige antibodies seem here to turn up over high - affinity antibodies resulting in overall lower avidity . there is still controversy about the beneficial role of low - affinity ige antibodies . according to xiong et al . these can compete with high - affinity ige for binding to high - affinity ige receptors and prevent anaphylaxis in atopic allergy . otherwise this possibility has been stated unlikely because very high levels of ige are needed to adequately saturate ige receptors . also in this case we could speculate that , once a sensitization process has occurred , following continuous contact with anisakis proteins of other specificities than those leading to the allergic episode , leads to maintaining lower affinity antibodies . this would be an explanation to the fact that patients sensitized to anisakis do not react with acute type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in provocation tests with non viable anisakis larvae [ 28 , 29 ] . furthermore , blocking antibodies']"

image [ 6 , 7 ] . although these dental implant studies did not focus on postmenopausal women , esthetics would seem an important parameter for this cohort . investigations by cosmetic surgeons , which do focus on postmenopausal women , confirm that as women age the focus of esthetic procedures tends towards the lower third of their face as opposed to younger counterparts who focus on skin and nose . traditionally , dental investigations are concerned with treatment efficacy involving clinical parameters rather than individual patient perspective . in contrast , the world health organization ( who ) recognizes the importance of oral - health - related qol within this framework through campaigns which portray not only images of pain - free living but also aesthetic images using attractive smiles as an image of enhanced well - being . as a result of this difference , recent research is refocused to consider how oral health affects far reaching aspects of life such as psychosocial interaction , self - esteem , intimacy , overall health , and performance at work . in spite of the seemingly high importance of comfort , function , and esthetics', 'the tooth versus implant supported prosthesis in a partially edentulous patient . in light of inconclusive and contradictory review papers , we note that subjective patient - related factors and major determinants of qol may be easier to investigate when the study is limited to specific cohorts . as such , focusing future qol investigation on a more homogenous sample , such as ours , may be productive . additionally , specifically validated instruments for homogenous cohorts , such as the utian survey in postmenopausal women , may be useful to study qol . the use of a survey validated specifically for a target population separates the methodology used in the current study from previous ones . previous studies used measurement instruments , such as oral health impact profile ( ohip ) , or a shorted version of that survey , which are generally applicable for generalizable groups . in order to make decisions about the most appropriate treatment option in rehabilitation a dentist must understand not only the prosthetic therapeutic specifics such as chewing function and orofacial esthetics but also the patient - centered specifics of psychosocial and overall well - being . the results of the current investigation indicate that implant retained oral rehabilitation of missing teeth has a statistically significant impact over nonimplant and traditional fixed restorations , removable restorations , and no restoration of missing teeth in far reaching areas including occupational , health , emotional , sexual , and overall qol . within the limited diagnostic accuracy of the methods used for the identification of onj used in the present work , the incidence of bisphosphonate related onj seems to be very low and supports the rate cited in the most current literature .', 'dental college , bangalore , with forwardly placed front teeth . on examination , on the class 1 skeletal base , she had proclined maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth with spacing , deep bite , crowding in the posterior segment with scissor bite . on soft tissue examination , they diagnosed her to be having chronic localized periodontitis compounded with trauma from occlusion . on clinical examination , grade iii mobility of maxillary anterior teeth preoperative photographs and opg after inter departmental discussion on the treatment plan , it was decided to proceed with following steps in this case : phase i therapy comprising of scaling and root planing before orthodontic treatment.alignment of the teeth with light forces using copper niti wires after extraction of 15 , 24 , 34 , and 44.continuous monitoring of periodontal health with periodic scaling and root planing and administration of gengigel ( 0.8% hyaluronic acid ) to improve the attachment was coordinated by the periodontist . alignment of the teeth with light forces using copper niti wires after extraction of 15 , 24 , 34 , and 44 . continuous monitoring of periodontal health with periodic scaling and root planing and administration of gengigel ( 0.8% hyaluronic acid ) to improve the attachment was coordinated by the periodontist . after evaluation , regenerative periodontal therapy comprising of gtr and bone graft for the osseous defect . after the initial prophylactic treatment for the next phase of retraction and space closure in the mandibular arch , we used 1925 ss wires and the same was achieved [ figure 3 ] . mid treatment photographs and opg , retraction and space closure continuous periodontal follow -

814 ) in accordance with the helsinki declaration . all participants completed the study questionnaire freely and informed consent was implicit on agreeing to complete the written survey . participant charts were obtained from the case / cleveland clinic postmenopausal wellness collaboration ( cccpw ) database of over 900 samples with dates of examination between january 2002 and october 2014 completed by trained panel of experts . the selection criteria included otherwise healthy , partially edentulous , postmenopausal women having osteoporosis . for this study , partially edentulous participant is defined as missing more than one tooth in adjacent sites , other than a premolars or third molars , at the time of examination for entry to the database . menopause is defined by the absence of menses for at least 1 year either naturally or surgically . osteoporosis is defined through dual x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) scan t - score < 2.0 at either hip or spine within the last 5 years . the score is the patient 's bone density compared with a standard norm expected in a healthy 30-year - old woman . the t - score is the number of standard deviations away from the standard ( figure 1 ) . exclusion criteria included validated qol confounders and are noted in the following list . after a complete cccpw database search , 237 met inclusion , did not get excluded , and fully completed the survey ( figure 2 ) . ad hoc analysis shows that power of the study is 80% to detect a 2.1 difference in qol outcome . exclusion criteria included the following"", 'as the proportion of people over the age of 55 increases in the united states , so does the uncertainty of age related changes which may impact dental treatment . osteoporosis is said to increase the risk of tooth loss in postmenopausal women , but the mechanism remains unclear . otherwise healthy , vibrant postmenopausal women take steps ranging from lifestyle changes ( such as improved diet and exercise ) to medications ( hormone replacement therapy and bone sparing medications ) to prevent and treat osteoporosis . both the effects of postmenopausal osteoporosis and the risks associated with the medications used to treat it have complicated decision making during the planning phase of dental implant therapy [ 24 ] . drugs from a class of bone sparing medications , the bisphosphonates , have been associated with a condition called osteonecrosis of the jaws ( onj ) . even though the incidence of onj is recognized to be less than 0.1% the cases are considered questionable because they have abnormal features relating to the jaws but no visible necrotic bone ( pathognomonic of onj ) such that the condition can not be fully adjudicated . studies suggest that dental implant therapy improves esthetics and self - image [ 6 , 7 ] . although these dental implant studies did not focus on postmenopausal women , esthetics would seem an important parameter for this cohort . investigations by cosmetic surgeons , which do focus on postmenopausal women , confirm that as women age the focus of esthetic procedures tends towards the lower third of their face as opposed to younger counterparts who focus on skin and nose . traditionally , dental investigations are concerned with treatment efficacy involving clinical parameters rather than individual patient perspective . in contrast , the world health organization ( who ) recognizes the importance of oral - health - related qol within this framework through campaigns which portray not only images of pain - free living but also aesthetic images using attractive smiles as an image of enhanced well - being . as a result of this difference , recent research is refocused to consider how oral health affects far reaching aspects of life such as psychosocial interaction , self - esteem , intimacy , overall health , and performance at work . in spite of the seemingly high importance of comfort , function , and esthetics', 'participants were employees of the tokyo gas company that supplies natural gas to the tokyo area . all employees received annual health checkups and completed a health questionnaire in accordance with the industrial safety and health law . the participants for this study were 5,984 male employees who had participated in an annual health checkup and annual submaximal exercise tests in 1985 . among these men , 335 were excluded because they were found at the health checkup to have at least one of the following : diabetes ( n = 102 ) , cardiovascular disease including hypertension ( n = 228 ) , tuberculosis ( n = 3 ) , or gastrointestinal disease ( n = 9 ) . for the present study , we also required participants to have at least four submaximal exercise tests in the previous 7 years ( 19791985 ) . this excluded 1,462 men , leaving 4,187 men , who were followed until june 1999 for the development of type 2 diabetes . the initial exercise loads were 600 , 525 , and 450 kilopond meter / min for participants aged 2029 , 3039 , and 4049 years , respectively . heart rate was calculated from the r -

Why are fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery considered challenging to treat?,"The treatment of fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery is challenging due to the presence of perforating vessels, the proximity to the brain stem and exiting cranial nerves, and the surgical approaches needed to access the basilar artery.","Fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery are considered challenging to treat due to several reasons including the presence of perforating vessels, the proximity to the brain stem and the exiting cranial nerves, and the surgical approaches necessary to access the basilar artery.","[""dolichoectatic and fusiform aneurysms represent a small subset of cerebral aneurysms and are among the most difficult to treat . the pathophysiology of fusiform cerebral aneurysms includes a disrupted internal elastic lamina and muscle layer that might be susceptible to mechanical injury by hemodynamic strain , causing progressive attenuation of the arterial wall . the treatment of fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery is challenging for several reasons , including the presence of perforating vessels , the proximity to the brain stem and the exiting cranial nerves , and the surgical approaches necessary to access the basilar artery . we present the case of a patient with acute brain stem ischemic stroke who had a fusiform basilar artery aneurysm complicated by a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage . our objective is to discuss the difficulties in the acute management of this disease , its potential treatments and complications . a 53-year - old man with a previous history of hypertension and obesity was admitted to our emergency department with sudden right hemiplegia , hemianopsia , and dysarthria within 2 h from symptom onset . his national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) score at admission was 19 , and he had no previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks . the patient 's neurological symptoms progressively improved during the first hour after admission , with only a right facial palsy ( nihss 2 ) remaining . a head ct at admission showed a hyperdense basilar artery , and a ct angiography ( cta ) confirmed a basilar fusiform aneurysm with a thrombus within the vessel and no signs of acute dissection ( fig . he was treated with antiplatelets and transferred to our intensive care unit . due to his clinical improvement a head ct revealed an extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and posterior fossa ( fisher grade 3 ;

What were the NIHSS score and remaining symptoms of the patient after initial improvement?,"After initial improvement, the patient's NIHSS score was 2, with only a right facial palsy remaining.",I dont know.,"[', physical performance , nonverbal reasoning , and fluid intelligence were often impaired but all of them had fair to good response to training . on the contrary , problems such as the patient s short attention span were frustrating . because cognitive recovery was significantly impaired despite recovery in other neurological deficits , compensating cognitive deficits might be a core concept for late - phase rehabilitation.6 family education about rational goals and the importance of strictly carrying out cognitive - behavioral therapy at home might also be helpful . moreover , an individualized education program to address a child s distraction , delayed information interpretation speed , and learning difficulty is also suggested to be executed in school.6 most articles about anti -

loss of the retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) function and the hyperpermeability of retinal vessels consequent to the retinochoroidal concussion injury may be the important contributing factors . vertical scan through the macula on optical coherence tomography at presentation showing discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium and a full - thickness macular hole - associated retinal detachment horizontal scan through the macula on optical coherence tomography at presentation showing discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium and a full - thickness macular hole - associated retinal detachment the mechanisms responsible for the spontaneous closure of a traumatic mh include proliferating glial cells and rpe cells from the edges that fill the hole ; formation of an epiretinal membrane that constricts the hole ; and reattachment of the operculum to the mh . there was no operculum or membrane formation in our case but we expect the proliferating potential of the recovering glial and rpe cells to be high in our patient , considering his young age , which eventually led to the closure of the mh . this mechanism is consistent with the histopathologic study of a surgically treated mh', 'discussion on the complications associated with the management of anesthesia during laparoscopic surgery . pneumothorax is one of the serious complications , although it rarely occurs in association with laparoscopic surgery . yet in cases of laparoscopic tep hernia repair , surgical procedures such as the insufflation of co2 or the insertion of laparoscopic ports themselves are restricted to the extraperitoneal space . however , its prevalence is likely to increase as the procedure continues to gain popularity . a few cases in the anesthesia literature describes that laparoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repair having been complicated by pneumothorax without hemodynamic instability and/or subcutaneous emphysema [ 5 - 8 ] . in our case , the patient developed intraoperatively pneumothorax with hemodynamic instability . in cases of pneumothorax occurring during general anesthesia , such non - surgically related complications as barotrauma , damage to the bronchus during endotracheal intubation , rupture of congenital bulla or blebs , and side effects due to the insertion of a central venous catheter a central venous catheter was not inserted and an excessive extent of positive pressure ventilation was not performed . accordingly , the complications of this case were assumed to have occurred in association with the surgical procedure . based on the findings that the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters improved when the insufflation of co2 gas was discontinued , the occurrence of pneumothorax due to a non - surgical cause could be ruled out . for the current case , the first was that co2 entered the retroperitoneal space and then it entered the pleural space and mediastinum along the tissue plane . this might be consistent with the pathway for which the subcutaneous emphysema occurred in the neck and upper chest area in the current case . chien et al . reported on three patients who developed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and laryngopharyngeal areas . a hypothesis for the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema is that co2 enters the retroperitoneal space through a myopectineal dissection and then it reaches the neck . accordingly , it has been reported that setting the insufflation pressure of co2 below 10 mmhg and keeping the insufflation time below 2 hours are helpful for preventing pneumothorax . shim et al . reported that pneumothorax was occurred during retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy because insufflations pressures were over 15 mmhg . in the current case , the insufflation pressure was 12', ""the unselected upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage cohort . in the sa group , 88 patients were receiving warfarin as stroke prophylaxis because of atrial fibrillation , 17 for a prosthetic heart valve , 16 for a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation , 4 for venous thromboembolism , and 3 for other reasons . there was a trend toward more benign endoscopic diagnoses in the sa group . in the patients with peptic ulceration , there was no significant difference in forrest classification between the two groups ( sa group : 10 of 42 class i , 5 of 42 class iia , 7 of 42 class iib ;

csl ltd , broadmeadows , australia ) , fresh frozen plasma , and platelet and packed red cell transfusion were obtained from a national transfusion database . all patients taking warfarin who had an inr of 3 or higher were included in a supratherapeutic anticoagulation ( sa ) group . the optmatch package in r 8 was used to match these patients to a control group of patients taken from the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage database who were not taking warfarin at presentation . patients were matched for age , sex , pre - endoscopy rockall score , year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage , inpatient or outpatient status , and the presence of disseminated cancer at presentation . the year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was analysed as a dichotomous variable , with patients recorded as having had an episode of bleeding in either the first or the second half of the study period . patients were matched for year of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to ensure that changes in referral patterns or in clinical management over the study period did not contribute bias to the outcome . patients were not well matched on age and presence of disseminated cancer at presentation if the rockall score alone was used as a', 'bleeding were higher for all of these agents when compared with warfarin ; however , mortality from bleeding was lower primarily because of a reduced rate of fatal intracranial hemorrhage . as clinical experience accumulates for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with the use of factor x inhibitors or direct thrombin inhibitors , the outcome of these patients will become clearer . because it is retrospective in nature , this analysis is subject to potential sources of bias . the most important of these is that the inclusion of patients in the study was subject to the performance of endoscopy , and the threshold for performing endoscopy may have differed between patients taking warfarin and those not taking warfarin . however , the proportion of patients receiving blood transfusion , and the clinical and laboratory parameters suggestive of heavy bleeding at presentation ( serum urea and hemoglobin levels , pulse rate , and blood pressure ) , were similar between the sa patients and those in the control group , suggesting that the severity of bleeding was similar in the two groups . despite high levels of comorbidity , which are known to predict a poor outcome , a supratherapeutic inr at presentation due to warfarin use was associated with reduced mortality in patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage . reduced mortality may have been due to the effect of warfarin anticoagulation inducing bleeding from lesser mucosal lesions , with such bleeding more effectively controlled by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to endoscopic therapy and proton pump inhibitor infusion . alternatively , the lower mortality rate may have been due to a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction during episodes of bleeding as a result of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin .', ""of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to ensure that changes in referral patterns or in clinical management over the study period did not contribute bias to the outcome . patients were not well matched on age and presence of disseminated cancer at presentation if the rockall score alone was used as a representative matching variable . we elected to control confounding by using the rockall score , and not the glasgow- blatchford score , although both are validated as predictors of death in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 9 . patients were considered to have had an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage if they had hematemesis or coffee ground vomitus , or if they passed melena per rectum . a rebleeding event was defined as further fresh hematemesis , melena with associated hemodynamic instability ( defined as pulse rate > 100 beats / min or systolic blood pressure < 100 mmhg ) , or a drop in the hemoglobin level of 20 points or greater and hemodynamic instability subsequent to endoscopy . the r statistical programming environment 8 was used for statistical analysis . demographics , baseline characteristics , endoscopic findings , and treatment administered were compared between the two groups to assess the adequacy of matching and potentially confounding factors . student 's t test was used to compare continuous variables , and a chi - square test was used to compare categorical variables . a p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant with the use of two - tailed testing . the need for surgery , occurrence of rebleeding , and need for transfusion were analysed as secondary outcomes . a total of 1603 patients met the inclusion criteria , 128 of whom were taking warfarin with an inr at admission of 3 or higher ( the sa group ) . the baseline characteristics , with the clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation , are listed in table 1 for the two groups and compared with those of all patients in the upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage database . the rate of comorbidity in the sa and control groups was significantly higher than in the unselected upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage cohort . in the sa group , 88 patients were receiving warfarin as stroke prophylaxis because of atrial fibrillation , 17 for a prosthetic heart valve , 16 for a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation , 4 for venous thromboembolism , and 3 for""]"

and , second , the utilitarian argument that punishment , as a prima facie evil , can only be justified by countervailing good consequences , achieved through specific or general deterrence , incapacitation , rehabilitation , restitution or moral education ( an argument most rigorously worked out by bentham ) . the ideas that punishment is in some deep sense retribution for a blameworthy act or an institutionalised expression of affective blame , and that an offender s blameworthy conduct is what justifies punishment , have deep historical roots . yet the fortunes of retributive theories of punishment based on culpability blameworthiness in the sense of responsibility for wrongful conduct have been mixed , particularly since the development of consequentialist justifications for punishment , from the writings of cesar beccaria and jeremy bentham to the present day . but', 'criminal process was not , of course , restricted to proponents of just deserts , it also characterised theories which seek to combine backward - looking and forward - looking considerations in the justification of punishment . but the justice model successfully presented itself as the approach best able to generate an account of punishment compatible with both full respect for offenders as agents and the modern ambition to achieve even - handedness , constrained discretion and most important to our argument in this paper limits on state punishment . the limiting principles celebrated by the justice model are underpinned by the further claim that a certain proportionality can be built in to the quantum of punishment ; and that this in turn is guaranteed by the backward - looking orientation of punishment s justification . the idea that punishment is conditioned on , and responds to , blameworthiness implies that the punishment must be proportionate to it . it was therefore widely assumed and hoped that the proportionality implied by desert would provide clear limits on punishment . by linking not only the justification but the distribution and quantum of punishment to the offender s desert , in the sense of the level of blameworthiness appropriately to be attached to the offence , the justice model appeared to offer a clear limit on the extent of the state s right to punish , and presented itself as a progressive , humane and liberal approach . this aspiration is , however , very far from having been universally realised in practice . thirty years on , the practical impact of the justice model presents a mixed picture , and in liberal market countries such as england and wales , scotland , australia , new zealand and most spectacularly the united states , the scale of punishment has increased relentlessly . this penal grade inflation has a number of different dimensions , of which we here mention only the most obvious . the imprisonment rate per hundred thousand of the population has soared , as a result of both increasing flows of defendants through the criminal courts and a rise in sentence levels , particularly for certain categories of offence . mandatory sentencing systems have become a common feature of these liberal market systems , and many of the sentencing guideline systems designed to foster the determinacy sought by the justice', 'only from the middle of the 18 century that this self - evidence of punishment seems to have been under challenge . they include the emergence of more egalitarian and democratic ideas in europe and north america ;

to reflect on the theoretical and practical resources which resonate with modern moral and political discourse ; and to ponder how best they may be institutionalised under particular conditions . both moral commonality and the sense of a real relationship between victim and offender as fellow members of a society have doubtless been attenuated by the increasing heterogeneity and moral pluralisation of social orders , especially in the more individualistic , competitive , liberal market countries . those countries in which the retributive revival appears to have had the most baleful effect in eroding the institutional counterpart to reconciliatory dispositions in the criminal process are those in which inequality , conflict and heterogeneity are highest . conversely , scholarship on punishment in the nordic countries associates their penal moderation with their relative homogeneity , their relatively small size and hence sense of social interdependence , solidarity , and trust , their consensus - oriented political systems , and their relative levels of equality all factors which foster conditions for the institutional counterpart of forgivingness and enhance expected associational value . the lesson for the more punitive and less equal liberal market countries is that avoiding polarisation and reducing inequality is likely to be as important as the effort to reconstruct the criminal process to effectively foster repentance and reconciliation ;

modern , part of the ancien rgime . in the process of modernisation , those symbolic systems were either fully rejected as irrational or uncivilised , or demoted in political importance . but if they were indeed important in calibrating , legitimising and stabilising punishment , efforts at penal reform may have been hindered by a failure to appreciate their role or to acknowledge the impossibility of reviving them by an act of political will . the neoclassical aspiration was to create modern mechanisms for fixing cardinal as well as ordinal proportionality ; but the impact as well as the shape of such mechanisms has varied decisively even among otherwise comparable countries . this raises questions about the implications of the value pluralism and heterogeneity typical of individualistic and secularised western democracies , and particularly in the competitive political systems of the liberal market economies such as the united kingdom and the united states , for our efforts to garner consensus about appropriate limits on punishment under contemporary conditions . a useful goal is therefore to work towards an understanding of the institutional conditions and broader social arrangements under which a successful orientation to limited punishment and to reconciliation may be stabilised . in this section we begin this task , arguing that this capacity is greatest where by broad analogy', 'the cultural and institutional arrangements which can make the metaphor of proportionality meaningful , and punishment accordingly limited in real terms . in addressing these questions , a useful place to start is by looking at certain features of the penal systems which predated the modern push towards consequentialism in punishment , or which continue to exist in parts of the world whose penal practices were less decisively affected by the processes of modernisation and democratisation which swept europe and the united states in the 18 and 19 centuries . in many of their earlier forms , retributive ideas related to wider frameworks of social and ethical meaning which underpinned prevailing social and political systems and institutional practices an environment which had fundamentally changed by the time attempts were made , in the 1970s , to revive and realise retributive ideas . an effort to understand the nature of the lost cosmology which leant meaning to early modern punishments impressionistic as it must be within the confines of a single paper may , we suggest , help to explain such capacity as they enjoyed to institutionalise a practice of retributive punishments within clear limits , the very distance of the examples helping us to think more imaginatively about how the legitimation of penal practices is shaped by prevailing interests , institutions and ideas . both the historical and the conceptual foundations of retributivism are generally associated with the lex talionis . taking this as our core example therefore while bearing in mind the analogies with other systems such as the corporal penalties typical of the early modern criminal justice systems of europe and the system of penalties prescribed by sharia law we would suggest that early systems of retributivism had at least three distinctive features key to their legitimation and stability . the first was a social ontology of status hierarchy which rendered the legitimation of punishment a far less pressing issue than it is in liberal societies which place a high value on individual autonomy , and which prescribed different forms of penalty calibrated with social class and oriented to widely understood marks of degradation . this was manifested in either religious doctrines of damnation , expiation , atonement , penitence and so on , or a vision of political authority marked by symbols of supra - human or highly particular human authority such as the divinity or majesty', '. yet the fortunes of retributive theories of punishment based on culpability blameworthiness in the sense of responsibility for wrongful conduct have been mixed , particularly since the development of consequentialist justifications for punishment , from the writings of cesar beccaria and jeremy bentham to the present day . but a brief review of the relative fortunes of retributive and consequentialist rationales is useful in identifying the precise misunderstandings about the concept of proportionality as the modern expression of the retributive ethic , and about its capacity to anchor punishment within clear limits , to which we want to draw attention . until the 18 century , what we might call a retributivism of symbolic equivalence dominated both the theory and practice of punishment in most of europe . to focus on england as an example , a panoply of ( to our eyes ) harsh corporal and social penalties branding , maiming , whipping , pillorying , the use of the branks or scold s bridle and , ultimately , capital punishment were deemed equivalent to the relevant offence , and inflicted in public , hence reinforcing spectators apprehension of that equivalence . in a pre - democratic world , the moral logic of the lex talionis an eye for an eye appears to have struck a deep chord , not least because of the resonance between penal authority and various christian doctrines . indeed the idea that penalties should be measured and proportionate finds its origins in the ecclesiastical law practice of imposing graduated fines a practice in stark contrast to princely , secular early modern penalties , in which the monarch s power to punish or to pardon through an exercise of grace was the antithesis of the classical aspiration to mete out even - handedly a just measure of pain. a robust form of retributivism the idea that the application of a deserved penalty is , a priori , a self - evident good barely requiring justification , indeed something which is morally required appears not to have posed significant problems of legitimation . it is only from the middle of the 18 century that this self - evidence of punishment seems to have been under challenge . they include the emergence of more egalitarian and democratic ideas in europe and north america ; the growth of sentiments opposed to the public display of violence ;']"

the newgate ordinary s widely read reports on the spiritual condition and conduct of the condemned in the run - up to execution ; and the street ballads and pamphlets which were preoccupied with not only the drama of justice being done but also the condemned offender s reception of the punishment . often and , within this literary genre , ideally such reception included scaffold speeches that consisted of confession and penitence , transforming execution into a potential scene of redemption within christian cosmology . indeed , many historians accounts of the behaviour of the scaffold crowd and of the choreography of the procession and execution process suggest that the offender s confession was key to the successful enactment of what amounted to a highly ritualised and cathartic with which punishment was meted out , all the participants had a part to play in the script . the vision of legitimate power and authority which underpinned the early modern english penal system did not , of course , consist only or even primarily in christian doctrines : here as in other early ( and some existing ) systems , social codes of honour and status were also important . but there can be little doubt that this world of widely shared deference to authority , and vision of authority as vested with , broadly , sacred significance majesty made a certain sense of penal practices , constituting penality as one among many social rituals in which that', 'to widely understood marks of degradation . this was manifested in either religious doctrines of damnation , expiation , atonement , penitence and so on , or a vision of political authority marked by symbols of supra - human or highly particular human authority such as the divinity or majesty , implying the princely power not only to punish but to pardon through the exercise of grace. the third was what we will call a shared symbolism of equivalence . of course , few systems have attempted to enact literally the symbols of cardinal proportionality contained in the lex talionis . but the fact is that , to contemporaries , prescribed punishments in many early modern systems related in some intuitively meaningful way to the wrong done ( and typically did so independently of any psychological judgments of responsibility which complicate assessment of culpability in modern desert theory , and which emerge alongside modern , psychological conceptions of selfhood ) . each of these conditions made it possible to coordinate the expectations of the relevant actors so that they were in agreement on not only the need for a penal response , but equally the appropriate shape which that response might take . if we look back to the early modern english penalties which seem so cruel , horrifying and indeed disproportionate today , we can nonetheless acknowledge that they found their form , and took their place , within a composite view of political authority which itself drew on symbols , doctrines and common values , as well as being stabilised by a rigid status hierarchy and an authoritarian system of governance conditions which also applied , of course , to the church , whose panoply of graduated fines represents a fascinating precursor to modern conceptions of proportionality . this was , of course , by our standards an unduly hierarchical and undemocratic world ; and the rituals which elaborated different forms of capital penalty , as well as the different forms of corporal penalty such as branding , pillorying and so on , strike us , for good reason , as deeply inhumane . moreover the idea of punishment before the public gaze a key condition for the diffusion of shared perceptions of symbolic equivalence is now regarded as fundamentally uncivilised . but it is worth remembering that the world view from which these penal practices proceeded was']"

to reflect on the theoretical and practical resources which resonate with modern moral and political discourse ; and to ponder how best they may be institutionalised under particular conditions . both moral commonality and the sense of a real relationship between victim and offender as fellow members of a society have doubtless been attenuated by the increasing heterogeneity and moral pluralisation of social orders , especially in the more individualistic , competitive , liberal market countries . those countries in which the retributive revival appears to have had the most baleful effect in eroding the institutional counterpart to reconciliatory dispositions in the criminal process are those in which inequality , conflict and heterogeneity are highest . conversely , scholarship on punishment in the nordic countries associates their penal moderation with their relative homogeneity , their relatively small size and hence sense of social interdependence , solidarity , and trust , their consensus - oriented political systems , and their relative levels of equality all factors which foster conditions for the institutional counterpart of forgivingness and enhance expected associational value . the lesson for the more punitive and less equal liberal market countries is that avoiding polarisation and reducing inequality is likely to be as important as the effort to reconstruct the criminal process to effectively foster repentance and reconciliation ;

What are the three categories of malignant tumors of thyroid follicular cell origin?,"Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and undifferentiated/anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).","The three categories of malignant tumors of thyroid follicular cell origin are well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDT), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and undifferentiated/anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).","['malignant tumors of thyroid follicular cell origin are categorized as well - differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( wdtc ) , consisting the majority of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( ptc ) and follicular thyroid carcinoma , poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( pdtc ) , and undifferentiated / anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( atc ) . the 5-year , 10-year and 15-year survival rates are considerably lower in patients with pdtc ( 50% , 34% , and 0 , respectively ) than those in patients with wdtc ( 95% , 86% , and 81% , respectively ) . it is important to recognize this entity . at present , ultrasound is the most important imaging method used for the preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules , which focuses on the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions . as most thyroid carcinomas are ptcs , pdtc accounts for only about 1% of all thyroid cancers , and the malignant ultrasonographic features reported in the literature have mainly been based on ptc . nonetheless , no study has reported on the diagnosis of suspicious pdtc based on integrating clinical and ultrasonographic features . herein , we retrospectively analyzed our hospital database to study the differences between pdtc and ptc with the aim to provide more possibilities for recognizing pdtc earlier . this study was approved by the ethics committee of peking union medical college hospital , and written informed consents were obtained from all patients to use their data in this study . a total of 29 patients with primary pdtc were treated at peking union medical college hospital from november 2003 to december 2013 . six cases with incomplete clinical data , 2 cases without surgical treatment , 3 cases with initial surgery at another hospital , and 3 cases with no ultrasound reports were excluded . finally , 13 patients ( 10 women and 3 men ) with 16 nodules ( three patients had two nodules each ) were included in this study . the age of all 13 patients of pdtc ranged from 30 to 77 years , with a mean age of 48.1 14.8 years . five patients underwent fine needle biopsy ( fna ) , of whom 3 were suggested ptc , 1 was suggested finding carcinoma cells , and only one was suggested pdtc . in the database during the corresponding period , 39 gender- and age - matched cases pathologically', ""of other tumors can also increase the risk of thyroid carcinoma . however , due to the limited sample size in this study , this will require validation in a larger patient cohort . the results of this study suggest that patients with nodular goiter or hashimoto thyroiditis have a higher risk of pdtc than ptc ; thus , close clinical observation and follow - up are recommended . the proliferation of follicular cells in the nodular goiter may be associated with a greater possibility of atypical hyperplasia and vascular proliferation . the reason may be that hashimoto thyroiditis increases the patient 's immune response , leading to hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells through stimulation of lymphocytes and results in the occurrence of atypical hyperplasia at the focus transitional zone . owing to the low incidence but high malignant potential , pdtc is not well recognized and is often discovered incidentally during treatment when it has metastasized to lymph nodes or distant organs . as it is reported in the literature , pdtc is characterized by rapid , invasive growth , and higher mortality rate than ptc and is prone to lymphatic and other remote metastases . accurate preoperative diagnosis , clinical staging , and risk assessment are very important to help make the treatment protocol and establish prognosis . ultrasound is a valid method for diagnosis and follow - up of thyroid carcinoma . with the help of ultrasound - guided fna biopsy , thyroid carcinoma at an early stage however , there are many reports of the misdiagnosis of pdtc ; fna may reveal a follicular tumor , follicular variant of ptc , adenomatous nodule , or ptc . this may be related to the larger size , rapid invasive growth , limited amount of sample , and necrosis of the interested area of pdtc . if we do not take positive and effective intervention for the above cases , we may miss the best time for treatment and improving the prognosis . our study showed that pdtc and ptc have a variety of ultrasound features in common , such as irregular shape , taller - than - wide , hypoechoic , heterogeneous , solid mass , and micro - calcification , and these characters are the indicators of suspicious malignant tumor . in addition , three following features suggest that the lesion may be pdtc :"", 'histological image of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma with large areas of necrosis and peripheral fibrosis . tumor cells were relatively uniform in size , with round nuclei , vacuolar -

activated protein kinase ) and pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ) signaling pathways . its mitogenic actions are mainly mediated by camp , which in turn activates protein kinase a ( pka ) dependent and independent pathways . activating mutations of the tsh receptor ( tshr ) or of the gene encoding the gs subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein that couples tshr to adenylyl cyclase ( gsp ) have been described in 30% of autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas while they are rare in thyroid carcinomas [ 2 , 3 ] . tsh , however , has a well - known promoting role for thyroid cancer metastases , and tsh suppressive therapy with l - thyroxine is a well - established therapy in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer . to exert its maximal mitogenic effects studies carried out in thyroid cell cultures have especially highlighted the importance of the igf system in regulating thyroid cell growth in response to tsh [ 5 , 6 ] . tsh makes the cells competent to progress into the g1 phase in response to insulin', '14.8 years . five patients underwent fine needle biopsy ( fna ) , of whom 3 were suggested ptc , 1 was suggested finding carcinoma cells , and only one was suggested pdtc . in the database during the corresponding period , 39 gender- and age -

What imaging method is currently most important for the preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules?,Ultrasound is the most important imaging method used for the preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules.,Ultrasound,"[""a total of 51 nodules ( 12 patients had two nodules each ) . twenty ptc patients underwent fna , 14 were suggested ptc , 2 were found suspicious tumor cell , 3 were suggested follicular lesion , and 1 was suggested not finding enough cells to make a diagnosis . age , gender , family history of carcinoma , complication with other thyroid lesions , single / multiple nodules , single / multi focal carcinoma , lymph node metastases , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , distant metastases , tumor , node , metastasis stage , and survival rate were recorded . all patients underwent routine thyroid ultrasound examinations with gelogic7 , gelogic9 , or philipsiu22 before surgery with transducer frequencies of 815 mhz and 512 mhz . in particular , standard ultrasound features were analyzed , including shape ( regular or irregular : regular shapes refer to all round and oval shapes while irregular shapes refer to all other shapes , such as large lobular , small lobular , and nodular ) , margin ( clear or unclear ) , anteroposterior to transverse diameter ratio ( < 1 or 1 ) , echogenicity ( isoechoic or hypoechoic ) , echotexture ( homogeneous or heterogeneous ) , cystic features ( solid -

than - wide , hypoechoic , heterogeneous , solid mass , and micro - calcification , and these characters are the indicators of suspicious malignant tumor . in addition , three following features suggest that the lesion may be pdtc : size larger than 3 cm , clear margin , and irregular / rich blood signals . in this study , 92.3% of pdtc had clear margins ( 12/13 ) by ultrasonography , which was significantly higher than that of ptc ( p < 0.05 ) . in general , a tumor having margin echoes with a smooth and complete appearance can be considered have an intact capsule . most nodules without margin echoes or with an indistinct and irregular shape are noncapsulated malignant lesions . as the foci of tumor cells in ptc is not clearly separated from the surrounding thyroid tissues , with common interstitial infiltration in the surrounding thyroid parenchyma , the margin is unclear , and the edge shows spiculated infiltration by ultrasonography . however , the classical pathological feature of pdtc is an island structure , which is a distinct nest of tumor cells surrounded by a thin layer of fibrovascular stroma . the area between tumor foci and the fibrovascular core often forms an artificial fracture lacking either typical papilla or a follicular structure . about half of ptc showed sparse blood flow or no blood flow signal while 92.3% of pdtc displayed rich and prominent blood flow probably because of the higher malignant potential of pdtc , which is accompanied by stimulation of angiogenesis by tumor cells . in this regard , most blood vessels consist of arteries with irregular distribution . in summary , pdtc is more aggressive , and its mortality rate is higher than ptc . accordingly , more attention should be given to thyroid cancer nodules that show large size , regular shape , and rich blood flow signals on ultrasound to exclude the possibility of pdtc .', ""of other tumors can also increase the risk of thyroid carcinoma . however , due to the limited sample size in this study , this will require validation in a larger patient cohort . the results of this study suggest that patients with nodular goiter or hashimoto thyroiditis have a higher risk of pdtc than ptc ; thus , close clinical observation and follow - up are recommended . the proliferation of follicular cells in the nodular goiter may be associated with a greater possibility of atypical hyperplasia and vascular proliferation . the reason may be that hashimoto thyroiditis increases the patient 's immune response , leading to hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells through stimulation of lymphocytes and results in the occurrence of atypical hyperplasia at the focus transitional zone . owing to the low incidence but high malignant potential , pdtc is not well recognized and is often discovered incidentally during treatment when it has metastasized to lymph nodes or distant organs . as it is reported in the literature , pdtc is characterized by rapid , invasive growth , and higher mortality rate than ptc and is prone to lymphatic and other remote metastases . accurate preoperative diagnosis , clinical staging , and risk assessment are very important to help make the treatment protocol and establish prognosis . ultrasound is a valid method for diagnosis and follow - up of thyroid carcinoma . with the help of ultrasound - guided fna biopsy , thyroid carcinoma at an early stage however , there are many reports of the misdiagnosis of pdtc ; fna may reveal a follicular tumor , follicular variant of ptc , adenomatous nodule , or ptc . this may be related to the larger size , rapid invasive growth , limited amount of sample , and necrosis of the interested area of pdtc . if we do not take positive and effective intervention for the above cases , we may miss the best time for treatment and improving the prognosis . our study showed that pdtc and ptc have a variety of ultrasound features in common , such as irregular shape , taller -

differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( wdtc ) , consisting the majority of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( ptc ) and follicular thyroid carcinoma , poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( pdtc ) , and undifferentiated / anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( atc ) . the 5-year , 10-year and 15-year survival rates are considerably lower in patients with pdtc ( 50% , 34% , and 0 , respectively ) than those in patients with wdtc ( 95% , 86% , and 81% , respectively ) . it is important to recognize this entity . at present , ultrasound is the most important imaging method used for the preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules , which focuses on the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions . as most thyroid carcinomas are ptcs , pdtc accounts for only about 1% of all thyroid cancers , and the malignant ultrasonographic features reported in the literature have mainly been based on ptc . nonetheless , no study has reported on the diagnosis of suspicious pdtc based on integrating clinical and ultrasonographic features . herein , we retrospectively analyzed our hospital database to study the differences between pdtc and ptc with the aim to provide more possibilities for recognizing pdtc earlier . this study was approved by the ethics committee of peking union medical college hospital , and written informed consents were obtained from all patients to use their data in this study . a total of 29 patients with primary pdtc were treated at peking union medical college hospital from november 2003 to december 2013 . six cases with incomplete clinical data , 2 cases without surgical treatment , 3 cases with initial surgery at another hospital , and 3 cases with no ultrasound reports were excluded . finally , 13 patients ( 10 women and 3 men ) with 16 nodules ( three patients had two nodules each ) were included in this study . the age of all 13 patients of pdtc ranged from 30 to 77 years , with a mean age of 48.1 14.8 years . five patients underwent fine needle biopsy ( fna ) , of whom 3 were suggested ptc , 1 was suggested finding carcinoma cells , and only one was suggested pdtc . in the database during the corresponding period , 39 gender- and age -

What alternative service was introduced by the University of Miyazaki Hospital to assist in emergency situations when helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) is not available?,The University of

treatment strategy has been recommended in the guidelines of the eastern association for the surgery of trauma . if injury occurs at a location that is distant from an emergency medical facility , there is a risk of a sudden deterioration in a patient s condition during transportation , as happened in this case . treatment for hemorrhagic shock includes resuscitation , blood transfusion , and hemostasis , and transporting the patient to a facility that can perform early - stage definitive treatment is essential . in this case , we administered approximately 3000 ml of fluid to resuscitate him from his state of shock . recent studies have shown that restricting pre - hospital fluid infusion for hemorrhagic shock patients reduces blood transfusion volumes . however , fluid restriction is not amenable during long - distance transport to proper facilities . therefore , carrying blood products such as packed red blood cells in doctor cars is prudent for remote traumas . miyazaki prefecture has employed a hems since 2012 . however , because helicopters are restricted to visual flight in japan , our hospital initiated a doctor car system as an alternative to the hems in 2014 . in the case presented herein , more than 2 h passed before the patient reached the hospital . for an emergency occurring at a location that is distant from the doctor car base hospital , early - stage medical intervention is accomplished by transporting the patient to a local medical facility before the arrival of the doctor car . had the examination and treatment commenced only in the doctor car , medical intervention would have been delayed by a further 17 min , with possible detrimental consequences . consistent with the american college of surgeons guidelines on trauma , the japan

center ( hereinafter referred to as our center ) commenced its rapid response - type doctor car services ( hereinafter referred to as doctor car ) in april 2014 . doctor cars have been introduced as alternatives in situations where a helicopter emergency medical service ( hems ) can not be dispatched owing to poor visual flight conditions . a doctor car is presumed to be ineffective for emergencies occurring far from a base hospital because of delayed medical intervention . in this report , we present a case of severe trauma that occurred at a remote location , in which the patient s life was saved by close coordination between the dispatched doctor car and a physician from a local medical facility . a 31-year - old man was logging trees in the westernmost mountains of the prefecture in june 2014 when a tree collapsed and injured his left femur . he sought first aid at the nearby fire station , but because the trauma was suspected to be severe , the station requested a hems from our center , which was approximately 56 km away . however , the hems could not be dispatched because of bad weather , and a doctor car was sent instead . soon after the doctor car was dispatched to the scene , the same fire station also requested kobayashi municipal hospital , which was the nearest hospital from the scene , to send a physician to the scene ( figure 1figure 1a map of miyazaki prefecture , located in southwest japan . the scene of the accident ( closed circle ) is in the mountains , remote from the university of miyazaki hospital ( open circle ) which is the base hospital of the doctor car . the general hospital closest to the scene of the accident is kobayashi municipal hospital ( open box ) . the doctor car traveled on the highway shown in gray lines to reach the patient . the docking point ( closed box ) is almost halfway between kobayashi', 'the doctor car . had the examination and treatment commenced only in the doctor car , medical intervention would have been delayed by a further 17 min , with possible detrimental consequences . consistent with the american college of surgeons guidelines on trauma , the japan prehospital trauma evaluation and care program also recommends transporting the patient to a higher - level facility while bypassing the nearest emergency medical facility for the sake of a definitive diagnosis during the golden hour ( within 1 h after injury ) . as the prefecture s jurisdiction is large , trauma bypass alone may not always save lives . in fact , a systematic review conducted by hill et al . revealed no difference in the mortality rate of trauma patients transferred directly to the trauma center compared with that of patients temporarily hospitalized in a non - trauma center before transfer . however , since a nearby emergency medical facility may not be able to adequately treat patients with severe external wounds , it is critical to inform the higher - level emergency medical facility of the patient s condition at an early stage . a doctor car with an emergency physician dispatched simultaneously while the patient is being transported to a nearby emergency medical facility can serve this purpose . however , a doctor car requires time to arrive at locations that are remote from the base hospital . therefore , it is essential that fire stations recognize patients with serious illnesses and promptly request a doctor car . according to the guidelines published by american college of surgeons committee on trauma in 2014 , the undertriaging rate should be restricted to 5% of cases or less , whereas an overtriaging rate of 2535% is permitted . however , when the accident occurs in a location that is remote from the trauma center , a greater overtriaging rate for the doctor car ought to be permitted . in our case , the doctor car and the ambulance arrived at the docking point almost simultaneously . in a doctor car , the dispatched physician usually coordinates the docking

the injured and proximal areas , respectively , to achieve hemostasis . the physician from kobayashi municipal hospital arrived at the accident scene 49 min after the accident and established a peripheral intravenous line . the doctor car from our center docked at the halfway point between the scene of the accident and the municipal hospital at 1 h 6 min after the accident . although pressure hemostasis was achieved with gauze , the patient subsequently went into hemorrhagic shock . he was transported to our center for resuscitation via blood transfusion , as emergency blood transfusion was not possible and complete hemostasis was not obtained at the municipal hospital . because his state of shock was prolonged , tracheal intubation was performed en route . during that time , the wound began hemorrhaging again , suggesting coagulopathy , and pressure hemostasis using gauze continued to be applied . photographs of the injury were transmitted to our center , along with the patient s information , through the image transmission system to prepare blood transfusions and summon the surgeons . upon arrival at our hospital', 'dispatched physician usually coordinates the docking point with the fire station and the dispatched emergency response team ; to reduce the waiting time , it is important to choose a safe docking location that is accessible to both vehicles . to achieve successful docking of the doctor car and ambulance car , the dispatched physician needs to skillfully handle communication tools such as a cell phone or radio . in miyazaki prefecture , if the expected docking point was located in the area controlled by another fire station , the fire station that controlled the expected docking area must support the communication between doctor car and ambulance car by relaying the radio transmissions . to arrive at the destination facility as early as possible , the doctor should minimize the time spent at the docking point , because medical intervention is not difficult while traveling to the destination facility . in our case , 2 min elapsed between making patient contact and leaving the docking point , and tracheal intubation was performed in the ambulance en route . owing to its speedy departure from the site , the ambulance was able to reach the hospital earlier while communicating the patient s condition to the destination facility for adequate preparation of blood transfusions and surgical personnel . we reemphasize that an early request for a doctor car , reducing the time to reach the docking point , and sending all relevant information to the destination institute are essential for taking full advantage of the abilities of doctor cars . the patient s life was saved despite the accident occurring at a location distant from the doctor car base hospital . this case , in which an emergency physician was dispatched with the doctor car , illustrates an additional use for doctor cars aside from their effectiveness in early - stage medical intervention .']"

type doctor car services ( hereinafter referred to as doctor car ) in april 2014 . doctor cars have been introduced as alternatives in situations where a helicopter emergency medical service ( hems ) can not be dispatched owing to poor visual flight conditions . a doctor car is presumed to be ineffective for emergencies occurring far from a base hospital because of delayed medical intervention . in this report , we present a case of severe trauma that occurred at a remote location , in which the patient s life was saved by close coordination between the dispatched doctor car and a physician from a local medical facility . a 31-year - old man was logging trees in the westernmost mountains of the prefecture in june 2014 when a tree collapsed and injured his left femur . he sought first aid at the nearby fire station , but because the trauma was suspected to be severe , the station requested a hems from our center , which was approximately 56 km away . however , the hems could not be dispatched because of bad weather , and a doctor car was sent instead . soon after the doctor car was dispatched to the scene , the same fire station also requested kobayashi municipal hospital , which was the nearest hospital from the scene , to send a physician to the scene ( figure 1figure 1a map of miyazaki prefecture , located in southwest japan . the scene of the accident ( closed circle ) is in the mountains , remote from the university of miyazaki hospital ( open circle ) which is the base hospital of the doctor car . the general hospital closest to the scene of the accident is kobayashi municipal hospital ( open box ) . the doctor car traveled on the highway shown in gray lines to reach the patient . the docking point ( closed box ) is almost halfway between kobayashi', 'the doctor car . had the examination and treatment commenced only in the doctor car , medical intervention would have been delayed by a further 17 min , with possible detrimental consequences . consistent with the american college of surgeons guidelines on trauma , the japan prehospital trauma evaluation and care program also recommends transporting the patient to a higher - level facility while bypassing the nearest emergency medical facility for the sake of a definitive diagnosis during the golden hour ( within 1 h after injury ) . as the prefecture s jurisdiction is large , trauma bypass alone may not always save lives . in fact , a systematic review conducted by hill et al . revealed no difference in the mortality rate of trauma patients transferred directly to the trauma center compared with that of patients temporarily hospitalized in a non - trauma center before transfer . however , since a nearby emergency medical facility may not be able to adequately treat patients with severe external wounds , it is critical to inform the higher - level emergency medical facility of the patient s condition at an early stage . a doctor car with an emergency physician dispatched simultaneously while the patient is being transported to a nearby emergency medical facility can serve this purpose . however , a doctor car requires time to arrive at locations that are remote from the base hospital . therefore , it is essential that fire stations recognize patients with serious illnesses and promptly request a doctor car . according to the guidelines published by american college of surgeons committee on trauma in 2014 , the undertriaging rate should be restricted to 5% of cases or less , whereas an overtriaging rate of 2535% is permitted . however , when the accident occurs in a location that is remote from the trauma center , a greater overtriaging rate for the doctor car ought to be permitted . in our case , the doctor car and the ambulance arrived at the docking point almost simultaneously . in a doctor car , the dispatched physician usually coordinates the docking point with the fire station and the dispatched emergency response team ; to reduce the waiting time , it is important to choose a safe docking location that is accessible to both vehicles . to achieve successful docking of the doctor car and ambulance', 'dispatched physician usually coordinates the docking point with the fire station and the dispatched emergency response team ; to reduce the waiting time , it is important to choose a safe docking location that is accessible to both vehicles . to achieve successful docking of the doctor car and ambulance car , the dispatched physician needs to skillfully handle communication tools such as a cell phone or radio . in miyazaki prefecture , if the expected docking point was located in the area controlled by another fire station , the fire station that controlled the expected docking area must support the communication between doctor car and ambulance car by relaying the radio transmissions . to arrive at the destination facility as early as possible , the doctor should minimize the time spent at the docking point , because medical intervention is not difficult while traveling to the destination facility . in our case , 2 min elapsed between making patient contact and leaving the docking point , and tracheal intubation was performed in the ambulance en route . owing to its speedy departure from the site , the ambulance was able to reach the hospital earlier while communicating the patient s condition to the destination facility for adequate preparation of blood transfusions and surgical personnel . we reemphasize that an early request for a doctor car , reducing the time to reach the docking point , and sending all relevant information to the destination institute are essential for taking full advantage of the abilities of doctor cars . the patient s life was saved despite the accident occurring at a location distant from the doctor car base hospital . this case , in which an emergency physician was dispatched with the doctor car , illustrates an additional use for doctor cars aside from their effectiveness in early -

for some , however , the risk of thromboembolism was perceived to be high , and warfarin or intravenous heparin was commenced within this period . a possible explanation for the observed difference in mortality is that supratherapeutic anticoagulation produces clinically significant bleeding from lower - risk mucosal lesions . patients can be readily treated by reversal of anticoagulation in addition to standard management ( endoscopic therapy and intravenous infusion of omeprazole ) . a higher proportion of patients in the sa group with only gastric or duodenal erosions seen at endoscopy supports this hypothesis . a trend toward an increased rate of surgery in the control group is also supportive . the small number of deaths in this study precludes statistical analysis of the causes of death in a meaningful way . it is biologically plausible that there may be a beneficial effect of anticoagulation on the cardiac circulation during a time of physiologic stress , such as', 'less was considered significant with the use of two - tailed testing . the need for surgery , occurrence of rebleeding , and need for transfusion were analysed as secondary outcomes . the study was conducted in a single regional hospital ( waikato hospital , hamilton , new zealand ) between 23rd february 2001 and 12 october 2010 . for all patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at presentation to the hospital or during an admission for a different condition , the following were recorded prospectively in a dedicated upper gastrointestinal bleed database : presenting features , endoscopic diagnosis , presence of stigmata of recent hemorrhage ( including forrest classification of peptic ulceration ) 6 7 and administered treatment . those patients with evidence of variceal bleeding were excluded from the analysis . when a patient had more than one episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage during the study period , only the first event was included . additional clinical and laboratory data at presentation were retrospectively collected through review of the clinical record . data regarding the use of prothrombinex ( pooled purified human coagulation factors ii , ix , and x ;

equipped graduates if complete redesigning is not undertaken . the core of the system is the encounter between people who need services and those who have been entrusted to deliver them . the charter of medical professionalism states that , to focus on primacy of patient welfare , doctor self - care is necessary for the doctors to meet the professional obligations expected of them . empathy can be threatened by doctor 's distress , which is seen at all levels of medical training . clinical teaching brings together the learning triad of patient , student and clinician / teacher in a particular clinical environment . direct contact with patients is important for the development of clinical reasoning , communication skills , professional attitudes and empathy [ annexure diagram 1 ] . it is generally observed that patients do not know about anaesthesia - related procedures and are anxious about surgery resulting in an overall excessively painful post - operative experience . pain , modulate the neurobiology towards more excruciating post - operative pain . overall goal of our study was to teach the learning anaesthesiologists to communicate effectively with the patients . the aim was to teach them to build a rapport with patients , so as to assure them a smooth intra and less painful post - operative course . the teaching was expected to be effective enough to obtain a calm and cooperative patient for spinal anaesthesia on table . the positive modulation of the neurobiology of patients was tested post - operatively by asking them both positively as well as negatively valenced questions . the questionnaires were either oriented towards pain ( pain group ) or towards comfort ( comfort group ) . the questions in both groups were serially comparable"", 'useful . comparison of the analgesic requirement in our study shows group c patients more comfortable than group p. dauphinee described the outcome of current education policies in health professions . he referred to the need of a common framework to find out the impact of education programs at advance levels of training . he suggested studying patient outcomes like improved survival , fewer complications and fewer side - effects from the hospital records and patient feedbacks about the quality of life reported after the treatment from patient records . though post - operative questions were oriented towards either pain or comfort , number of patients without pain was found to be more in c - group than in p - group . pain at rest and botheration due to wound was found to be comparable with less requirement of analgesics in c - group . we , therefore , conclude that the pain mechanism was effectively modulated pre -

centered care . lack of empathy is associated with suboptimal patient care behaviours and more recently as important clinical outcomes such as blood glucose and lipid control in diabetic patients . smith and mishra stated that in any doctor - patient encounter , fact - finding and information gathering is the agenda of a doctor , whereas exploring hopes and fears rather than precisely giving information about symptoms is seen on the part of the patient . communication should not be a mere exchange of words ; in anaesthesia teams , it should be directed towards co - ordinated and safe progress of the patient into anaesthesia . communications by the anaesthetist can elicit subconscious patient responses in mood resulting in anxiolysis and analgesia . for example , calling the sensation of a local anaesthetic injection a numbing sensation rather than a sting may result in quite different perceptions . pain being an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage ; therefore a nocebo or negative suggestion will elicit a subconscious change that might be expected to adversely affect the post - operative experience . senior faculty members were involved in training and teaching as follows : lectures were taken to create a background that patients are fearful about anaesthesia . students were informed about their involvement in patient interaction and the need for effective communication . students were explained the pathophysiology of pain and the need to adopt the practice of sympathetic listening to alleviate patients anxiety about anaesthesia and surgery . need for attitudinal change to impart the understanding about behavioural modification in future practice was taught . students were informed about the questionnaires [ annexures 1 and 2 ] that they will be required to ask to the patients . students were not aware as to which teacher is evaluating his / her performance at the time of giving spinal anaesthesia . the teachers were blinded about the type of questionnaire that the student will receive post -

however , there was no reaction during conventional daylight periods when light was suddenly switched off . that is why eeg from recording subjects with closed eyes in quiet wakefulness during daytime is methodically reasonable . this software calculates equivalent dipole source coordinates ( hereafter referred to simply as dipoles ) from eegs . the algorithm is based on solving a reverse electroencephalography task and is limited to a mathematical procedure of detecting sources of electrical activity , which are located in a three - dimensional brain space , from integral scalp - recorded potentials ( eeg ) . lately , a method of three - dimensional localization of eeg dipole sources is being successfully used in both applied and', 'pregnancy induced hypertension , coagulation disorders , placenta previa , heart disease and multiple pregnancies were excluded . totally 100 patients were studied with the indications for lscs being : previous lscs-24 , previous 2 lscs-11 , oligohydramnios-10 , post - dated pregnancy-7 , cephalo - pelvic disproportion-18 , intrauterine growth restriction-17 , failure of induction-5 and breech presentation-8 . the questions that were asked to patients in each group were comparable as shown in table 1 . comparison of number of patients responding to question 1 showed that , out of 50 patients in group p , 33 ( 66% ) did not complain of pain while 17 ( 34% ) had pain . in group c , 47 ( 94% ) patients felt that they were recovering and 3 ( 6% ) felt they were not . for comparison of question 2 in group p 27 ( 54% ) said yes , 23 ( 46% ) said no ; and in group c 40 out of 50 patients ( 80% ) said yes , 10 ( 20% ) said no . this shows that number of patients not having pain is more in c - group than in p - group . comparison of questions in both groups comparison of questions with results in both groups median visual analogue scale ( vas ) in group p was 3 , and in group c it was 8 . whitney test was used ; ( p < 0.01 ) significant difference in groups p and c was noted . lower vas score in group p means lesser pain scores in the group and higher vas score in group c means more comfort . comparison of number of patients responding to question 3 , when pain on movement was asked showed that in group p , 29 ( 58% ) had pain and 21 ( 42% ) had no pain . in group c , 24 ( 48% ) had pain , 26 ( 52% ) had no pain . p = 0.423 indicates , more patients complained of pain in group p ;

the difference in bmi was not dependent on maternal age ( table 1(a ) ) . there was a higher incidence of a history of miscarriage among the cases but the groups did not differ with respect to smoking habits , primiparity , previous stillbirth , severe illness or pregnancy complications , hb at admission to maternity health care centre , and sex of the infant or delivery method ( i.e. , caesarean section or vaginal delivery , table 1(a ) ) . the rate of labour induction was , not surprisingly , different between the groups ( table 1(a ) ) since induction is routine in cases of stillbirth in sweden . 21.4% was sga , while only 2.9% was sga in the control group ( table 1(a ) ) . similarly , the stillborn group showed lower absolute placental weight and a higher amount of small placental weight versus gestational age ( < 10th percentile ) when compared to the controls ( table 1(b ) ) . in the histological evaluation , several significant differences were noted ;

as the child died and in other , the family opted for alternative medical treatment , both families refused to complete the interview and were excluded from the study , hence 23 interviews were completed and analyzed . majority of the families had shown the negative response related to delivery of diagnostic information to child ( 65% , 15/23 ) , though it was encouraging to see at least 35% had been open to informing the child about their diagnosis figure 1 . though almost all ( 96% , 22/23 ) felt the child should not make any decision about the treatment figure 2 . majority ( 61% , 14/23 ) felt the child should not even be informed about side effects of therapy , and especially about long - term effects figure 3 . if the diagnosis , prognosis , and other information was to be told to the child , 100% preferred that the doctors to give the information to the child . though they all approved of the amount and content of information given to the child , only 21% ( 5/23 ) were satisfied with the timing or manner it was delivered"", 'ward , we record the patient history by questioning both the patients and their family members depending on their awareness of patient s condition , patients and their family members were sometimes willing to participate in the clinical judgment process . my father has allergy to salbutamol. she informed the doctor and the doctor prescribed an alternative medication . a shift supervisor said , to improve nurses clinical judgment skills , we held joint morning report sessions . we tried to involve physicians , nurse educators , and nursing students in these sessions . our participating nurses were willing to make independent nursing interventions , practice an independent profession , and create a distinctive professional identity . one of their strategies was to develop a specialized curriculum both for the theoretical and clinical nursing education . they believed that such a curriculum could help them make independent clinical judgments and hence , gain autonomy . a nurse said , after completing specialized trainings in intensive care , i acquired better clinical judgment skills and now i can make more accurate clinical judgments . nurses also noted that gaining more autonomy from medicine , in terms of nursing interventions , would help them make independent clinical judgments . accordingly , they had adopted strategies such as providing patient care based on nursing models and theories as well as clinical practice guidelines to enhance their autonomy . a practicing nurse said , providing care to patients based on orem s model helped us make autonomy independently from physicians . we , based on clinical practice guidelines , could judge whether the patient needed suprapubic bladder massage or any other intervention . nurses proficiency in using their own clinical knowledge , experience , and critical thinking skills as well as clinical evidence also helped them make independent clinical judgments . our participants were also striving for creating a culture for independent presence of nurses in clinical judgment . in an attending physician s words , in my tv talks , i tried to present nurses autonomy in clinical judgment . the participating nurses strived to use different clinical judgment skills based on patients condition and the immediate situation . for example , in emergency situations , if there was a lack of clinical guidelines , experienced nurses integrated their knowledge and experience for making accurate clinical judgments . a practicing nurse said ,', 'useful . comparison of the analgesic requirement in our study shows group c patients more comfortable than group p. dauphinee described the outcome of current education policies in health professions . he referred to the need of a common framework to find out the impact of education programs at advance levels of training . he suggested studying patient outcomes like improved survival , fewer complications and fewer side - effects from the hospital records and patient feedbacks about the quality of life reported after the treatment from patient records . though post - operative questions were oriented towards either pain or comfort , number of patients without pain was found to be more in c - group than in p - group . pain at rest and botheration due to wound was found to be comparable with less requirement of analgesics in c - group . we , therefore , conclude that the pain mechanism was effectively modulated pre - operatively with the soothing pre - operative dialogue .']"
What is the role of the periodontal ligament in orthodontic tooth movement?,"Tooth movement is primarily a periodontal ligament phenomenon, as it is mediated by the periodontal ligament when prolonged pressure is applied to a tooth.",The periodontal ligament is responsible for mediating the tooth movement during orthodontic treatment.

risk populations . in addition , most of the data have been in caucasian subjects . type 2 diabetes is a global problem ; thus , data are needed not only in high - risk populations but also in low - risk populations and in other racial / ethnic groups . one limitation of the present study is that subjects may not be representative of the entire japanese population and women were not included . another limitation is that possible changes in fitness levels were taken into account between 1979 and 1985 but not during the follow - up period , 19851999 . however , not accounting for changes during the latter period would probably dilute the true association between fitness and the risk of developing diabetes . in conclusion , this cohort study showed a strong inverse relationship between long - term trends in fitness and the development of type 2 diabetes in japanese men . this relationship was independent of age , initial fitness level , bmi , systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , and a family history of diabetes . thus , regular physical activity , which is associated with an increase or preservation of fitness , should be promoted by health professionals , because it decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes , in addition to decreasing the risks of many chronic diseases ( 17 ) .', 'rambaud found an incidence of 1% for all neonatal infections [ 8 , 9 ] . the variations in incidence between developing countries could be due to variations in the technical advancements of the health facilities , study designs and diagnostic criteria . the low incidences in the developed countries reflect higher standards of the health care in these countries , with neonates less exposed to infections . our results reflect those observed in morocco and madagascar , but differ from those of shresta et al in nepal , who observed that behavioral ( 42.7% ) , thermal ( 41.7% ) and muco - cutaneous signs ( 41.7% ) were most frequent . the most frequent risk factors found in our study are not different from those described by other authors . we found that the most frequent risk factors for infection were unexplained prematurity with gestational age < 35 weeks and prom . in other studies , the most frequent factors were foul - smelling vaginal discharge and prom , or prematurity and cervico - vaginal infections . in developed countries especially in france , abnormal amniotic fluid and prom were most frequent . according to the french national agency for accreditation and health , prom , premature gestation and perinatal maternal fever above 38c are major factors in neonatal infection . early - onset neonatal sepsis was by far the most frequent clinical presentation in 87.61% of the neonates , and is comparable to the rates from other african studies[16 , 17 ] and developing countries studies . this finding could imply that contamination occurred before or during delivery therefore highlighting the importance of good antenatal and perinatal care in order to prevent neonatal infections . the bacterial ecology was dominated by gram negative bacilli in both the early and late neonatal periods , although we had only 42 neonates with positive cultures . from all the germs this high prevalence of gram negative bacteria compared to gram positive has also been found in many other studies in other developing countries [ 14 , 18 , 19 ] . the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis in developing countries differ from those in developed countries . overall , gram negative pathogens are more common and group streptococcus , is generally rare . the small number of positive cultures reflects the difficulties neonatologists encounter when investigating babies with patent clinical', ', such growth conditions do not mimic the natural bacterial growth condition , which is affected by simultaneous actions and interaction of the growth factors . therefore , in the present study , we used a central composite design ( ccd ) and a response surface methodology ( rsm ) to examine the main and/or interactive effects of a factorial combination of ph , temperature , and agitation treatment factors on the growth of hib and biomass production . response surface methodology enabled the identification of optimum levels of growth factors in maximizing hib biomass , and more prp production as a direct result ( 10 , 13 ) . response surface methodology guides the plan of the experiments and the parsimonious analysis of data to gain a maximum amount of information most efficiently ( 14 , 15 ) . a strain of haemophilus influenzae type b , atcc 10211 , was used in all the experiments . the culture medium was prepared according to the method explained by maitre -

How can orthodontic treatment influence periodontal health in cases of malocclusion?,"A well-aligned dentition can be more conducive to periodontal health than a crowded dentition, which can lead to trauma from occlusion and aggravate the deterioration of the dentition.","Orthodontic treatment can improve periodontal health in cases of malocclusion by aligning the teeth and improving occlusion, which can enhance oral hygiene and reduce the risk of gingival inflammation. Additionally, orthodontic treatment can facilitate tooth movement and bone remodeling, leading to shallower pockets and improved periodontal conditions.","['multidisciplinary approach is often necessary to treat complex dental problems in our patients and there can not be a better example than ortho perio interaction . orthodontic treatment is based on the principle that if prolonged pressure is applied to a tooth , it will move as the surrounding bone remodels . in essence , the tooth moves through the bone carrying its attachment apparatus with it , as the socket of the tooth migrates . since this response is mediated by the periodontal ligament , tooth movement is primarily a periodontal ligament phenomenon . this being the situation , it is mandatory to see that good periodontal health prevails before , during , and after orthodontic treatment . it could be an oral prophylactic procedure in adolescent patients or advanced periodontal treatment in adults so as to eliminate the presence of inflammation in the presence of which carrying out orthodontic treatment will have deleterious effect . the orthodontic literature has presented different treatment modalities for the management of adult orthodontic patients with mild to moderate bone loss . however , the management of adult orthodontic patients with severe bone loss continues to present a challenge . all the experienced clinicians would agree that a well aligned dentition may be more conducive to periodontal health than a crowded dentition . the most important factor in the initiation , progression , and recurrence of periodontal problems is the presence of microbial plaque . inadequate maintenance of oral hygiene during orthodontic treatment increases the risk of developing gingival inflammation . many adult patients seek orthodontic treatment for aesthetic improvement due to the mal - alignment of the anterior teeth secondary to periodontal breakdown . but the aesthetics may not be the only concern for the clinician as malocclusion more often than not leads to trauma from occlusion , which would aggravate the deterioration of the dentition . in a follow - up study on 22 patients with up righted mandibular molars after an average of 3.5 years , it was reported that pockets on the mesial surfaces were shallower on the up righted teeth than on the control teeth . some case reports have reported that a reduction of probing depths in bony defects following tooth extrusion can also be achieved . the combination of orthodontic intrusion and periodontal treatment has also been shown to improve periodontal conditions in animals provided oral', 'light elastic chain to simultaneously intrude and retract the anterior teeth . at this juncture , we decided to do intentional root canal treatment for maxillary anterior teeth to avoid any endo - perio cross infection [ figure 5 ] . root canal therapy done with maxillary incisors as the desired movements were achieved , we shifted to 1925 stainless steel wire incorporated with curve of spee design . this helped us to intrude and retract the anterior segment as well as to convert the horizontal bone defect to a vertical defect which can receive and retain graft material [ figure 6 ] . post orthodontic treatment on achieving the short term orthodontic objectives such as alignment , good contacts , absence of rotations , class i occlusion with good cusp to fosse relation and good facial balance ; periodontal regenerative surgery was performed for 1221 . gtr with bone graft [ duopackcollagen membrane and reinforced tri calcium phosphate bone graft ] in region of vertical defect 12 - 11 [ figure 7 ] .

however , radiologic findings have not yet been described in precise detail . here , we report mammographic , ultrasound ( us ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings of primary breast mca in two patients , and review the literature focusing on imaging findings . a 59-year - old woman presented with a mass in her left breast detected on screening mammography . she was postmenopausal and did not have a family history of breast cancer or other malignancy according to her medical records . physical examination revealed a 1.5 cm mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast , 5 cm from the nipple . mammography showed a lobular - shaped circumscribed hyperdense mass , containing round or punctate microcalcifications ( figure 1a ) . on us , the mass was located at the far periphery of the left upper outer breast and appeared as a circumscribed complex cystic and solid mass . the solid portion of the mass showed an irregular shape and isoechogenicity , with multiple echogenic dots corresponding to the microcalcifications seen on mammography ( figure 1b ) . the solid portion showed low signal intensity ( si ) on t1 weighted imaging ( wi ) ( figure 1c ) and intermediate si on t2 wi ( figure 1d ) . on dynamic contrast - enhanced images , the mass showed rim enhancement and nodular enhancement of the solid portion with persistent enhancement kinetics ( figure 1e ) . the result of percutaneous core needle biopsy using a 14-gauge gun was intraductal carcinoma with mucin spillage . the differential diagnosis based on the percutaneous biopsy result was mucocele - like lesions with ductal carcinoma in situ or mucinous carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ . after partial mastectomy , a 2.0 cm mca with bloom - richardson grade i was diagnosed . most nuclei were basally located and somewhat bland ; however , some nuclei showed more atypia ( figure 1f ) . the tumor cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors but were positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ;', 'figure 2e ) , and heterogeneous enhancement with persistent enhancement kinetics ( figure 2f ) . percutaneous core needle biopsy using a 14-gauge gun found cystically dilated atypical mucinous glands , and mca was suspected . after a left partial mastectomy , a 2.2 cm mca with bloom - richardson grade iii was diagnosed ( figure 2 g , h ) . multiple variable sized cysts were filled with mucin . in this case , the mucinous epithelium showed marked atypia and pleomorphism . the tumor cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and were also negative for her2 . mca is characterized by cystic lesion containing mucin lined by columnar cells with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin or mucin - depleted columnar cells , while mucinous carcinoma is characterized by clusters of generally small and uniform cells floating in large amount of extracellular mucin . previous reports have mostly focused on pathologic findings , with only a few reports briefly describing radiologic findings , providing few details . mammographic findings of mca have been described in several case reports , and the most common finding was a well - defined multilobular mass with medium to high density . our cases showed lobular shaped masses with relatively circumscribed margins and round to punctate internal microcalcifications . reported us findings of primary breast mca are mostly circumscribed isoechoic to hypoechoic masses ; occasionally , irregular masses or cystic and solid masses have also been reported . one case showed a circumscribed complex cystic mass with a small solid portion , whereas the other showed a more solid portion with an irregular shape and indistinct margins . mri findings have not been described previously . in our cases , both tumors showed cystic and solid masses and the cystic portion of the masses showed a circumscribed margin and thin rim enhancement . the intracystic solid portion of the tumor showed nodular enhancement and a large irregular solid mass with heterogeneous enhancement . both showed persistent enhancement kinetics on dynamic enhancement images and intermediate si on t2 wi . in our cases , from the us findings of a complex cystic and solid mass , we considered the possibility of papillary neoplasm first . however , a vascular stalk or increased vascularity , which is a characteristic finding of papillary neoplasm , was not detected . on mri , our cases also showed a', '( figure 1a ) . on us , the mass was located at the far periphery of the left upper outer breast and appeared as a circumscribed complex cystic and solid mass . the solid portion of the mass showed an irregular shape and isoechogenicity , with multiple echogenic dots corresponding to the microcalcifications seen on mammography ( figure 1b ) . the solid portion showed low signal intensity ( si ) on t1 weighted imaging ( wi ) ( figure 1c ) and intermediate si on t2 wi ( figure 1d ) . on dynamic contrast - enhanced images , the mass showed rim enhancement and nodular enhancement of the solid portion with persistent enhancement kinetics ( figure 1e ) . the result of percutaneous core needle biopsy using a 14-gauge gun was intraductal carcinoma with mucin spillage . the differential diagnosis based on the percutaneous biopsy result was mucocele - like lesions with ductal carcinoma in situ or mucinous carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ . after partial mastectomy , a 2.0 cm mca with bloom - richardson grade i was diagnosed . most nuclei were basally located and somewhat bland ;

based image analysis tool that enabled us to acquire objective semi - quantitative scores of cd20 expression levels based on intensity and completeness of cd20-immunostaining of the ffpet sections . as indicated by the previous investigations using fcm analysis of fresh tissue samples , the levels of cd20 expression assessed by semi - quantitative immunohistochemistry were quite heterogeneous among the patients , with scores spread over a wide and linear range . by correlating the expression level of cd20 with the clinical outcomes , we were able to identify a subgroup of dlbcl patients with cd20 expression levels below the cut - off score , who showed poor efs and os independent of other known clinical and pathologic parameters . further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic role of the relative abundance of cd20 expression in a larger cohort . interestingly , shimizu et al . recently reported that histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitors augment cytotoxic effect of rituximab by increasing the level of cd20 in the cell lines of dlbcl . accordingly , the patients with lower levels of cd20 expression who could be less amenable to rituximab therapy could probably benefit from pretreatment of hdac inhibitors such as valproic acid prior to the standard r - chop treatment . alternatively , they could more likely benefit from the treatment with novel anti - cd20 monoclonal antibodies which show more anti - cancer activity in cd20 low - expression b - cell lymphomas . for example , ofatumumab ( a fully human anti - cd20 monoclonal antibody ) and obinutuzumab ( a humanized type ii antibody targeted against cd20 ) have been shown to be active and safe in clinical trials that had included patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia which is known to have relatively lower levels of cd20 expression . in conclusion , a level of cd20 expression is heterogeneous in dlbcl and lower level of cd20 expression is a poor prognostic marker for survival in patients with dlbcl who are treated with r -

patient encounter , fact - finding and information gathering is the agenda of a doctor , whereas exploring hopes and fears rather than precisely giving information about symptoms is seen on the part of the patient . communication should not be a mere exchange of words ; in anaesthesia teams , it should be directed towards co - ordinated and safe progress of the patient into anaesthesia . communications by the anaesthetist can elicit subconscious patient responses in mood resulting in anxiolysis and analgesia . for example , calling the sensation of a local anaesthetic injection a numbing sensation rather than a sting may result in quite different perceptions . pain being an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage ; therefore a nocebo or negative suggestion will elicit a subconscious change that might be expected to adversely affect the post - operative experience . senior faculty members were involved in training and teaching as follows : lectures were taken to create a background that patients are fearful about anaesthesia . students were informed about their involvement in patient interaction and the need for effective communication . students were explained the pathophysiology of pain and the need to adopt the practice of sympathetic listening to alleviate patients anxiety about anaesthesia and surgery . need for attitudinal change to impart the understanding about behavioural modification in future practice was taught . students were informed about the questionnaires [ annexures 1 and 2 ] that they will be required to ask to the patients . students were not aware as to which teacher is evaluating his / her performance at the time of giving spinal anaesthesia . the teachers were blinded about the type of questionnaire that the student will receive post -

( 25 ) reported a significant correlation between residents skillfulness and their ability to make accurate clinical judgments . our participating nurses tried to provide patient care based on nursing models and theories and clinical practice guidelines . gampel ( 26 ) reported that independent interventions can result in accurate clinical judgment only when they are designed and implemented based on professional standards . the study findings also revealed that nurses used clinical evidence as well as their own clinical knowledge , experience , and critical thinking skills to gain autonomy in clinical judgments . ( 24 ) noted that evidence - based practice and experience - based intuition improve nurses autonomy in clinical judgment . they also found that nurses struggled with organizational authorities for maintaining their professional autonomy ( 24 ) . our participants were also striving for developing a culture for improving nurses autonomy in clinical judgment . wang et al . ( 27 ) found that socio - cultural factors interfered with nurses professional autonomy in clinical judgment . we found that another strategy used by nurses for becoming professional was the integration of different clinical judgment skills in different situations . in case of limited access to clinical guidelines , more experienced nurses were able to use their intuition and critical thinking skills to make accurate clinical judgments and handle the situation . dickson ( 28 ) described how the nurses integrated different knowledge and skills to make decisions in the medication administration process . clarke ( 29 ) found that surgical residents who were able to use their clinical skills according to patient s conditions made clinical judgments that were more accurate .

judgment skills based on patients condition and the immediate situation . for example , in emergency situations , if there was a lack of clinical guidelines , experienced nurses integrated their knowledge and experience for making accurate clinical judgments . a practicing nurse said , immediately after delivery , the mother developed pulmonary emboli . as we had foreseen this problem based on our previous experiences , we immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and she revived . in emergency situations , inexperienced nurses had no option but to rely on physicians knowledge and experience to make clinical judgment . a practicing nurse affirmed this reliance on physicians when she said , at the emergency department , we had no guideline for making clinical judgment about patients needing computerized tomography ( ct ) scan . consequently , we were compelled to make judgment based on the attending physician s experience . in emergency situations , if nurses had access to guidelines , they made clinical judgments by integrating guidelines and their own knowledge and experience . a practicing nurse said , based on cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) guidelines , our judgment was that the patient needed cardio version . our previous experience also confirmed this . in normal conditions , however , nurses approach to integrating their clinical judgment skills

collection methods and appropriate analysis . on the other hand , the sincere cooperation of the participants was a strong point of this study .', 'nurses use these skills to assess patients and the environment and to process and interpret patient information in order identify and fulfill patient needs ( 5 ) . this process results in the establishment of nursing diagnoses , effective clinical decision - making , problem solving and the improvement of care quality ( 6 ) . such a structured approach to patient care is an important characteristic of structured professional judgment ( 7 ) . professionalization ( 8) in clinical judgment is a major challenge of modern nursing ( 7 ) and despite its critical importance , it is still poorly understood . previous studies have explored and identified some of the main characteristics of nurses professional practice , clinical judgment , and clinical decision - making . these characteristics included using knowledge and conceptual models in practice ( 9 , 10 ) , adopting an interdisciplinary collaborative decision - making approach ( 9 ) , including clinical judgment in nursing educational programs ( 11 , 12 ) , and using evidence , intuition and autonomy ( 13 ) . ( 11 ) noted that nurses skillfulness is one of the main characteristics of professional nursing practice . nurses skillfulness pertains to their ability to use their skills in different situations . in other words , nurses ability to use knowledge , experience and evidence , as well as their critical thinking skills in daily practice reflects their skillfulness in clinical judgment . professional autonomy is nurses ability to establish relationships and interact with others and to use knowledge and wisdom in daily clinical practice ( 14 ) . gillet et al . ( 15 ) conducted a survey study on 500 french nurses and reported that procedural justice and supervisors autonomy support , positively affects nurses satisfaction and perceived organizational support . implementing educational programs for improving nurses clinical judgment is another characteristic of professional nursing practice . kantar and alexander ( 16 ) integrated clinical judgment into nursing curriculum and reported that education enhances nurses clinical judgment skills ( 17 ) . other educational interventions such as conceptualizing ( 18 ) and simulation ( 19 ) as well as teaching critical thinking skills ( 20 ) can also improve nurses clinical judgment ability . 21 ) reported that nurses collaboration with other healthcare providers plays an important role in their professionalization . moreover , interdisciplinary collaboration between clinical']"

( 25 ) reported a significant correlation between residents skillfulness and their ability to make accurate clinical judgments . our participating nurses tried to provide patient care based on nursing models and theories and clinical practice guidelines . gampel ( 26 ) reported that independent interventions can result in accurate clinical judgment only when they are designed and implemented based on professional standards . the study findings also revealed that nurses used clinical evidence as well as their own clinical knowledge , experience , and critical thinking skills to gain autonomy in clinical judgments . ( 24 ) noted that evidence - based practice and experience - based intuition improve nurses autonomy in clinical judgment . they also found that nurses struggled with organizational authorities for maintaining their professional autonomy ( 24 ) . our participants were also striving for developing a culture for improving nurses autonomy in clinical judgment . wang et al . ( 27 ) found that socio - cultural factors interfered with nurses professional autonomy in clinical judgment . we found that another strategy used by nurses for becoming professional was the integration of different clinical judgment skills in different situations . in case of limited access to clinical guidelines , more experienced nurses were able to use their intuition and critical thinking skills to make accurate clinical judgments and handle the situation . dickson ( 28 ) described how the nurses integrated different knowledge and skills to make decisions in the medication administration process . clarke ( 29 ) found that surgical residents who were able to use their clinical skills according to patient s conditions made clinical judgments that were more accurate . ( 30 ) also found that nurses with higher ability in integrating different skills were more able to recognize and manage uncertainties in their practice . in a study aimed at evaluating implicit', 'use their clinical skills according to patient s conditions made clinical judgments that were more accurate . ( 30 ) also found that nurses with higher ability in integrating different skills were more able to recognize and manage uncertainties in their practice . in a study aimed at evaluating implicit clinical judgment , nakash and alegria ( 31 ) found that clinical judgment based on experience and knowledge could lead to the integration of information . our participating nurses were also scrambling to make effective educational interventions ( such as including the concept of clinical judgment in the nursing curriculum as well as continuing education , patient education , and self - learning programs ) to develop their clinical judgment ability . lasater ( 32 ) noted that the patterns of clinical judgment need to be integrated in students professional conduct . in previous studies , different educational interventions including clinical simulation ( 33 ) , concept mapping ( 11 ) , and continuing education programs ( 34 ) were developed and implemented for promoting clinical judgment . nielsen ( 35 ) reported that concept - based learning activities designed based on the tanner clinical judgment model enhanced students clinical judgment skills and helped them move form novice to experts . lasater ( 32 ) reported that to maximize the effectiveness of simulation in developing students clinical judgment skills , simulation - based educational programs need to be integrated into clinical education and practice . lasater and nielsen ( 36 ) , banning ( 37 ) also noted that incorporating experienced nurses and nurse educators into clinical judgment educational interventions helps expand students understanding of clinical judgment . striving for professional and inter professional collaboration was another strategy adopted by our participants for clinical judgment development . the collaboration was among all parties involved in patient care including physicians , nurses , patients , and their family members . ( 38 ) noted that collaboration between nurses and other staff could lead to avoid errors . according to legare et al . ( 9 ) , interdisciplinary collaboration and interpersonal interaction in the process of clinical decision - making and clinical judgment are the key attributes of nurses professionalism . interdisciplinary collaboration among nurses , specialists , nurse educators , and nursing students is an absolute prerequisite for developing critical thinking and clinical judgment skills ( 39 , 40 )', 'of the study findings , we performed data analysis concurrently with data collection and employed the constant comparison analysis , active listening , prolonged engagement and immersion techniques , as well as member - checking . moreover , we documented and kept a record regarding all of our analytic activities for the purpose of dependability . to ensure dependability we employed the triangulation technique . in triangulation , we collected the study data by using both the interview and the observation methods . to ensure the confirmability of the study findings , we employed the peer - check method . finally , we recruited a maximum variation sample to improve the transferability of the study findings . the study participants main concern was being non - professional in clinical judgment development . in response to this concern , they were struggling for becoming professional. this was the study s core category encompassing and linking all the other categories . when nurses were supported professionally , they were able to develop their professional clinical judgment . however , in case of growing presence of non professional factors , they were unable to openly practice their clinical judgment skills ( figure 1 ) . the properties or sub - categories of the study core category were striving for gaining professional autonomy , striving for integrating clinical judgment skills , scrambling to make effective educational interventions , and striving for professional and inter professional collaboration ( table 3 ) . our participating nurses were willing to make independent nursing interventions , practice an independent profession , and create a distinctive professional identity . one of their strategies was to develop a specialized curriculum both for the theoretical and clinical nursing education . they believed that such a curriculum could help them make independent clinical judgments and hence , gain autonomy . a nurse said , after completing specialized trainings in intensive care , i acquired better clinical judgment skills and now i can make more accurate clinical judgments . nurses also noted that gaining more autonomy from medicine , in terms of nursing interventions , would help them make independent clinical judgments . accordingly , they had adopted strategies such as providing patient care based on nursing models and theories as well as clinical practice guidelines to enhance their autonomy . a practicing nurse said , providing care to patients based on orem']"

it is located on the first anterior rib or the anterior tubercle of the c7 transverse process . the sympathetic fibers of the lower face , cervical , and upper limbs cross the stellate ganglion ; therefore , these fibers can be blocked with sgb . sgb is used in the differential diagnosis and treatment of autonomous nervous system disorders of the head , neck , and upper limbs . sgb increases the blood flow rate without altering the blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output , and stabilizes hypertonic conditions of the sympathetic nerves , thereby blocking the pain associated with visceral afferents . a skin biopsy performed on a seborrheic dermatitis patient 's lesion revealed increased counts of inflammatory mediators ( interleukin-1 , [ il-1 ] , il-2 , il-4 , il-6 , il-10 , il-12 , gamma interferon , tnf - a ) . liu et al . conducted a study on severe trauma patients and reported that the concentrations of il - b , il-6 , and tnf - a decreased 24 to 72 hours after a sgb . park et al . successfully treated an acne vulgaris patient with over 50 trials of sgb , and wajima et al . these results indicate that sgb is effective in reducing hyper inflammations caused by seborrheic dermatitis , and"", ""a 31-year - old male patient ( height 173 cm , weight 70 kg ) with no medical history of particular significance had been receiving treatment at a dermatology clinic for ten years for erythematous patches accompanied by non - painful itching in both nasal alar creases , both perioral areas , and both posterior auricular folds ( fig . 1 ) . a topical steroid treatment was chosen , as he had tested negative on the koh test . it was notable that even on the steroid treatment , skin lesions appeared when he consumed alcohol or was dehydrated . the patient was on the topical steroid treatment when he visited our hospital , and erythematous patches were visible in the nasal alar creases and perioral areas . as a previous study had reported a case of acne vulgaris treatment with sgb , and the mechanisms of acne vulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis the patient was positioned with the anterior spine extended , so that the transverse process of the c6 vertebra ( chassaignac 's tubercle ) could be easily detected . a needle was vertically inserted at the anterior tubercle and was placed on the transverse process . five ml of 1% mepivacaine were injected after fixing the needle in position and confirming that there were no abnormal sensations in the upper limb or blood aspiration . after administration of the injection on one side , ipsilateral ptosis and nasal obstruction occurred but faded about two hours later . the skin lesions disappeared within three days , after which the patient wished to stop the treatment for personal reasons . however , the patient revisited the hospital two months later due to a relapse . during the follow - up , the patient noted that there had been no symptoms up to one week before the revisit . we initiated the same treatment procedure and the patient 's skin lesions disappeared after five trials ( fig . fifty more trials were performed , and the patient has not seen a relapse of the symptoms or side effects since . although the fundamental cause of seborrheic dermatitis has not yet been identified , increased sebaceous gland secretions , the proliferation of malassezia spp , m. globose , and m. restricta and subsequent inflammation increase , as well as changes in the host immune function , are presumed to be some"", '- a decreased 24 to 72 hours after a sgb . park et al . successfully treated an acne vulgaris patient with over 50 trials of sgb , and wajima et al . these results indicate that sgb is effective in reducing hyper inflammations caused by seborrheic dermatitis , and thus in mitigating the related symptoms . according to a previous study by wakusugi , sgb improves the blood flow in the brain and influences hormone secretions , effectively improving the symptoms of diseases responsive to steroids ; hence , sgb can also be applied to seborrheic dermatitis . furthermore , sgb affects the neural and immune systems . the sympathetic nervous system , which stems from the nucleus ceruleus of the brainstem , plays an important role in the neural and immune systems . the post - ganglionic sympathetic nerves , which travel along the paravertebral ganglia and prevertebral ganglia , release norepinephrine into various tissues . the concentrations of brain norepinephrine and serum cortisol are proportionately raised to maintain the reflex circuit of the hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal and sympathetic nerve systems . under physiological conditions , the immune organs are innervated by the sympathetic nerves , and adrenergic receptors are expressed on the surface of most granulocytes . sgbs regulate the neuroendocrine - immune network and restore homeostasis within the body by blocking the sympathetic nervous system . this in turn is presumed to contribute to the restoration of unbalanced statuses , such as seborrheic dermatitis . from a different perspective , uchida et al . suggested that a chronic increase in sympathetic tone undermines the pinealocyte functions . subsequently , the plasma melatonin level is reduced , resulting in sleep deprivation , which in turn causes an increase in sympathetic tone . sgbs block this sympathetic cycle and restore a normal melatonin rhythm , ultimately helping patients to maintain a normal sympathetic tone . this restoration of a normal rhythm also contributes to the effective regulation of the neuroendocrine - immune network . in conclusion , seborrheic dermatitis patients are treated with antifungals and steroids . in cases in which the patients are unresponsive to these traditional treatment modalities sgbs can also be useful in the treatment of other cutaneous disorders with similar mechanisms .', 'the right and left periorbital areas , on the nose root ( fig . 1 ) , and on the neck . the right forearm had a unique , dry , non - scaly , round and well - delimited purple plaque . histological features consisted of an inflammatory neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding the deep part of the eccrine glands and edema of the dermis ( fig . another skin specimen was sent for culture and was negative for bacteria , mycobacteria , mycoses and virus . following the confirmed diagnosis , symptomatic treatment with potent corticosteroid cream was enforced . the neutrophil count normalized without filgrastim after 3 weeks . as for the neh , it slowly resolved with topical corticosteroid treatment , leaving faint , post - inflammatory erythematous plaques in the areas described above . a preventive treatment with oral dapsone was recommended for a possible consolidation chemotherapy step involving cytarabine . it is associated with an adult population diagnosed with leukemia and receiving chemotherapy . a computerized literature review by bachmeyer and aractingi analyzed 51 patients from 1982 to 1998 . from 1998 until may 2013 , several articles are mentioned below . while considering this diagnosis , one must first rule out an infection . tissue cultures for bacteria , mycobacteria , fungi and viruses must be considered and are generally negative . in this case , the patient presented erythematous and edematous plaques in the periorbital region , mimicking orbital cellulitis . six patients receiving induction chemotherapy with cytarabine for acute myelogenous leukemia presented facial plaques with similar descriptions [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . however , observations regarding the evolution of the plaques are poor except for 3 of the cases in whom the lesions slowly extended across the face [ 5 , 7 ] or neck - trunk region . finally , all of the 6 patients presented with febrile neutropenia . interestingly , we found one article describing a patient with periorbital , violaceous patches to acetaminophen . ultimately , facial neh was also described in 1 healthy patient with no medical history . the lesions are dark , erythematous , violaceous , or purpuric compared to cellulitis , where erythema with poorly defined margins ( or sharp borders in erysipelas ) is described . clinical cases have described neh with tender and painful lesions . also ,', 'the diagnosis is made histologically and usually refers to a neutrophilic infiltration around the eccrine sweat glands and mostly around the proximal portion coils . neh is usually described in relation to other neutrophilic dermatoses , a group of skin diseases characterized by an infiltration of the skin by normal polymorphonuclear neutrophils no infectious or other causes are identified ;

What has been the observed trend in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Korea?,The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Korea has been markedly increasing in recent years.,The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Korea has been markedly increasing in recent years.,"['the incidence of colorectal cancer ( crc ) in korea has been markedly increasing in recent years . this epidemiologic change in korea requires an increasing number of colonoscopies , which are highly effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of crc.1,2,3 colonoscopy is currently regarded as the gold standard and preferred screening method for crc . however , evidence suggests that colonoscopy is not as sensitive for the detection of neoplasia as previously believed , as demonstrated in studies analyzing the effectiveness of tandem colonoscopy and ct colonography.4,5 a systemic review of six studies on tandem colonoscopy showed that the pooled miss rate for polyps of any size was 22%.4 using ct colonography as a reference standard , the miss rate of conventional colonoscopy for a large adenoma ( 10 mm ) was 12%.5 as a result , a significant number of colorectal neoplasias , including cancers , may be missed , even by experienced endoscopists . moreover , results from the national polyp study and several other studies6,7,8 suggested that colonoscopy is associated with only a 37 - 65% reduction in mortality from crc , which is much lower than that reported previously . this could be attributed to the limited effectiveness of colonoscopic prevention of crc , especially in the right - sided colon . therefore , the role and limitations of colonoscopic screening must be carefully reconsidered . the problem of the so - called interval cancers or missed cancers has been highlighted recently.9,10,11,12 crcs detected in patients who have received colonoscopies within the surveillance interval are called interval cancers , and if they arise from missed lesions , they are also called missed cancers.13 this raises a question regarding the precise prevalence of interval cancer . early studies have shown that 4 - 5% of crcs may be missed on a single colonoscopic examination . 9,10 however , recent studies reported an increase in the prevalence of interval cancers of up to 8%.11,12 table 1 summarizes the major findings of studies conducted since 2006 reflecting the prevalence of interval cancers.8,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 based on 57,839 patients from the surveillance , epidemiology , and end results - medicare database , 7.2% of patients developed interval cancers.11 in a manitoba cancer registry database , approximately 7.9% ( approximately 1 in 13 ) of 4,833 crcs were classified as missed cancers.12 in korea , the prevalence of interval cancer was', 'interval cancers ( 3 - 5 years vs. 10 years ) , the use of data ( claims - based administrative vs. clinical data ) , differences in the study population ( screening vs. diagnostic indications ) , and differences in endoscopist specialty.27 however , most studies have shown that colonoscopy offers suboptimal protection against crc , especially in the right colon . we could estimate the magnitude of this risk in our routine practice in korea . assuming that proximately 20,588 new cases of crc were diagnosed ( data in 2007 ) based on the korea national cancer incidence database28,29 and considering an average risk scenario ( e.g. , 4 - 8% of diagnosed crcs are interval cancers ) , approximately 823 - 1,647 interval cancers might be expected to occur annually in korea . considering the increasing age of the general population and the number of colonoscopies performed in korea , the incidence of interval cancer is expected to increase . regardless of the magnitude of this problem , the medical and social impact of the failure of colonoscopy to prevent crcs may be devastating.27 therefore , prompt elucidation of the factors implicated in interval cancers is necessary . although the exact etiology of interval cancer is unknown , there are several potential explanations for such interval cancers . first , precancerous or cancerous lesions may have been missed at the time of colonoscopy.30 withdrawal time and technique deserve special consideration in this context , as the detection rate of colorectal neoplasia depends on the withdrawal time during colonoscopy . barclay et al.31 demonstrated that a withdrawal time 6 min is strongly correlated with an increased adenoma detection rate ( adr ) . in addition , careful inspection of the oral side of the mucosal folds is more important than simple adherence to a standard withdrawal time , especially in the proximal colon.32,33 the adr itself is also an important quality indicator for predicting the risk of interval cancers after screening colonoscopy . kaminski et al.17 demonstrated that the adr of endoscopist was significantly associated with the risk of interval cancer ( p=0.008 ) . endoscopies with an adr of less than 11.0% were associated with a 10.94-fold ( 95% ci , 1.37 - 87.01 ) higher risk of interval cancer than endoscopies with an adr of 20.0% or higher . complete colonoscopy , another quality indicator of', 'the surveillance , epidemiology , and end results - medicare database , 7.2% of patients developed interval cancers.11 in a manitoba cancer registry database , approximately 7.9% ( approximately 1 in 13 ) of 4,833 crcs were classified as missed cancers.12 in korea , the prevalence of interval cancer was reported to be 6.2% by kim et al.24 ; however , this study was limited by referral bias , selection bias , and recall bias , as it was based on data obtained by telephone calls from a single tertiary referral center . therefore , well - designed population studies are necessary to determine the prevalence of interval cancer in korea . in a population - based study from a danish group,25 interval cancer ( colonoscopies performed 1 - 5 years before diagnosis ) was 2.6% among 38,064 crc cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 . in a population - based study conducted in utah,26 6% of all patients with crc had interval cancers ( colonoscopies performed 6 - 60 months before diagnosis ) among 2,659 crcs diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 . most previous studies on interval cancers may be limited , as they relied on registry or administrative data , which frequently lack detail and might be less appropriate for the identification of underlying causes . previous studies were also limited by the fact that definitions of interval cancer were restricted to the initial 3 - 5 years after colonoscopy and did not specifically focus on a complete negative colonoscopy ( i.e. , a colonoscopy with no detection of adenoma ) . to overcome these limitations , a population - based study was performed in germany using the definition of interval cancer as a crc occurring within 10 years after a complete negative colonoscopy.21 using this 10-year definition , 4.0% of interval cancers were identified among 1,945 crc cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 . to interpret the large variation in the prevalence of interval cancer , several factors should be considered : differences in the study design ( retrospective vs. prospective ) , the different definitions of interval cancers ( 3 - 5 years vs. 10 years ) , the use of data ( claims - based administrative vs. clinical data ) , differences in the study population ( screening vs. diagnostic indications ) , and differences in endoscopist specialty.27 however , most studies have shown that', 'of interval cancer ) . in korea , a review of malpractice claims reported from the korea consumer agency ( database queried between 2009 and 2011 ) determined an increase of 205% in total claim consultations.52 in addition , the rate of diagnostic error for crcs was 6.8% of all cases of cancers associated with diagnostic errors . these data do not provide detailed information about interval cancer ; however , out anecdotal impression is that lawsuits alleging missed cancers are increasing . given the increased use of colonoscopy , the number of medicolegal litigation related to interval cancers would be logically expected to increase . colonoscopists are encouraged to reduce their risk by documenting the limitations of colonoscopy in the informed consent process and their data of colonoscopy quality ( e.g. , cecal intubation , bowel preparation , and withdrawal time ) . colonoscopists commonly discuss the complications of the procedure ; however , they seldom discuss the possibility of missed lesions and failure to prevent interval cancers.16 colonoscopy is not considered a perfect method by colonoscopists or by patients . informed consent may shift the burden of this reality from the colonoscopists to the patients . maintenance of an adequate level of colonoscopy quality indicators and detection of non - polypoid lesions , including ssas , especially in the right colon , may minimize the risk of medicolegal litigation related with interval cancer . considering the significant number of interval cancers that are encountered in daily clinical practice , the importance of adequate training and improvement of colonoscopy quality as causative factors in interval cancers should be highlighted . continuous monitoring of colonoscopy quality , which is amenable to improvement , can not be overstated to prevent the occurrence of interval cancers .', 'cancers were 0.92 and 1.0 after 1 years and 5 years , respectively.25 finally , cases of missed cancer are more common when the colonoscopy is performed by non - gastroenterologists.12,48 a recent canadian registry study12 showed that endoscopist specialty remains a significant predictor of missed cancers despite adjustment for procedural volume . rabeneck et al.48 also showed that non - gastroenterologists have a significantly higher rate of missed cancers than gastroenterologists , independent of procedural volume . the lack of an association between colonoscopy volume and missed cancers may indicate that even non - gastroenterologists who handle a high volume of procedures continue to miss more crcs than gastroenterologists . it may also indicate that formal endoscopic training generally leads to competency in colonoscopy , whereas providers who do not receive formal training are unable to achieve competence despite the volume of procedures they perform.12,47,48 a higher rate of interval cancers associated with index colonoscopies performed by general practice physicians was also found in studies from ontario and indiana.15,49 emerging evidence suggests a link between endoscopist specialty and colonoscopy quality in korea.50 to the best of our knowledge , there is no formal curriculum or guidelines in colonoscopy training for general practice physicians in korea . therefore , more stringent standards for training and assessment of colonoscopy quality are necessary to cope with the risk of interval cancer . generally , plaintiffs often allege inadequate performance of colonoscopy as the proximate cause of the interval cancer . to date , there is no published data on malpractice claims related with interval cancer . a review of malpractice claims filed with the physicians insurers association of america ( database queried between 1985 and 2008 ) determined that colonoscopy represents the highest frequency ( 41.5% ) of closed claims and the highest total indemnities ( $ 54,093,000 ) among gastrointestinal endoscopy claims.51 indeed , there was an average increase of 15.5% per year in total claim payments associated with colonoscopy , and the majority resulted from inadequate performance of an endoscopic procedure , followed by diagnosis error ( may include cases of interval cancer ) . in korea , a review of malpractice claims reported from the korea consumer agency ( database queried between 2009 and 2011 ) determined an increase of 205% in total claim consultations.52 in addition , the rate of diagnostic error for crcs was 6.8% of all']"

polypoid lesions , which have a subtle endoscopic appearance , may be more easily missed , especially by endoscopists with lower adr and in inadequate bowel preparations.13 previous several studies showed that non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers share some common features:15,19,35,36 both lesions are common in the proximal colon,15,19,35 and interval cancers have a flat appearance.36 although the relationship between non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers has not yet been clarified , endoscopists should be careful not to miss non - polypoid lesions during colonoscopy , especially in the right - sided colon . second , interval cancers may develop from the incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 the recent complete adenoma resection study showed that complete resection of neoplasia is far less common than previously thought.37 in the complete adenoma resection study , the incomplete resection rate varied broadly ( 6.5 - 22.7% ) among endoscopists , and was significantly higher in large and sessile lesions . robertson et al.38 showed that 26% of interval cancers occur in the same anatomic segments as those of a previous polypectomy , suggesting a possible role for incomplete polypectomy in the development of interval cancers . a dietary polyp prevention trial showed a similar rate of interval cancers after incomplete polypectomy.36 in this trial , in 4 of 13 patients , interval cancers were associated with incomplete polypectomy . lieberman et al.39 showed that the 5-year interval cancer rate after a normal colonoscopy without polypectomy is 0.17% , whereas', 'cancers were 0.92 and 1.0 after 1 years and 5 years , respectively.25 finally , cases of missed cancer are more common when the colonoscopy is performed by non -

high phenotype.44 in a multicenter study involving 32 endoscopy centers,45 the detection of proximal serrated lesions varied greatly among endoscopy centers ( p<0.0001 ) , and there was also substantial variation among pathologists in the identification of sessile , serrated lesions . fortunately , clinically significantly serrated polyps may be easier to detect with longer withdrawal times.46 the new hampshire colonoscopy registry study showed that a withdrawal time of 9 min resulted in a nearly 30% relative increase in serrated polyp detection.46 therefore , systemic education programs on serrated lesions as well as colonoscopy quality may improve the recognition and diagnosis of serrated lesions . recent evidence suggests that interval cancers are caused by a deficiency in the quality of colonoscopy rather than accelerated tumor biology.12,19 this is good news , as most interval cancers may be prevented by improving colonoscopy quality . first , as described above , interval cancers may develop from suboptimal quality indicators such as withdrawal time , adr , complete colonoscopy , and bowel preparation , as well as incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 in addition , the identification of serrated lesions may be improved with longer withdrawal time.46 second , the grade , stage , histology , and survival patterns do not differ between patients with interval cancer and those with non - interval cancer , which does not suggest an aggressive biology , but rather that the majority represent missed lesions.25,47 in a danish population - based registry,25 982 danish individuals with interval cancers were compared to two reference groups , namely , 358 individuals with crc identified more than 10 years after a colonoscopy and 35,707 individuals with crc but no prior colonoscopy . in this study , no significant differences were found in the characteristics of patients and tumors or survival between interval cancers and cancers arising more than 10 years after colonoscopy.25 the adjusted mortality rate ratios of interval cancers to non - interval cancers were 0.92 and 1.0 after 1 years and 5 years , respectively.25 finally , cases of missed cancer are more common when the colonoscopy is performed by non - gastroenterologists.12,48 a recent canadian registry study12 showed that endoscopist specialty remains a significant predictor of missed cancers despite adjustment for', 'of interval cancer ( p=0.008 ) . endoscopies with an adr of less than 11.0% were associated with a 10.94-fold ( 95% ci , 1.37 - 87.01 ) higher risk of interval cancer than endoscopies with an adr of 20.0% or higher . complete colonoscopy , another quality indicator of colonoscopy , is also associated with the risk of interval cancer.9 in a previous study conducted in new zealand , 9 of 17 interval cancers occurred after an incomplete colonoscopy.34 brenner et al.21 also showed that 18% of interval cancers were associated with the completeness of the preceding negative colonoscopy . in this study , interestingly , incompleteness of colonoscopy was associated with distal interval cancers as well as proximal interval cancers , which was explained by a strong association between incompleteness and other aspects of colonoscopy quality , including the miss rate in the distal colon . non - polypoid lesions , which have a subtle endoscopic appearance , may be more easily missed , especially by endoscopists with lower adr and in inadequate bowel preparations.13 previous several studies showed that non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers share some common features:15,19,35,36 both lesions are common in the proximal colon,15,19,35 and interval cancers have a flat appearance.36 although the relationship between non - polypoid lesions and interval cancers has not yet been clarified , endoscopists should be careful not to miss non - polypoid lesions during colonoscopy , especially in the right - sided colon . second , interval cancers may develop from the incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions.37,38,39 the recent complete adenoma resection study showed that complete resection of neoplasia is far less common than previously thought.37 in the complete adenoma resection study , the incomplete resection rate varied broadly ( 6.5 - 22.7% ) among endoscopists , and was significantly higher in large and sessile lesions . robertson et al.38 showed that 26% of interval cancers occur in the same anatomic segments as those of a previous polypectomy , suggesting a possible role for incomplete polypectomy in the development of interval cancers . a dietary polyp prevention trial showed a similar rate of interval cancers after incomplete polypectomy.36 in this trial , in 4 of 13 patients , interval cancers were associated with incomplete polypectomy . lieberman et al.39 showed that the 5-year interval cancer rate after a normal colonoscopy without polypectomy is 0.17% , whereas', 'interval cancers ( 3 - 5 years vs. 10 years ) , the use of data ( claims - based administrative vs. clinical data ) , differences in the study population ( screening vs. diagnostic indications ) , and differences in endoscopist specialty.27 however , most studies have shown that colonoscopy offers suboptimal protection against crc , especially in the right colon . we could estimate the magnitude of this risk in our routine practice in korea . assuming that proximately 20,588 new cases of crc were diagnosed ( data in 2007 ) based on the korea national cancer incidence database28,29 and considering an average risk scenario ( e.g. , 4 - 8% of diagnosed crcs are interval cancers ) , approximately 823 - 1,647 interval cancers might be expected to occur annually in korea . considering the increasing age of the general population and the number of colonoscopies performed in korea , the incidence of interval cancer is expected to increase . regardless of the magnitude of this problem , the medical and social impact of the failure of colonoscopy to prevent crcs may be devastating.27 therefore , prompt elucidation of the factors implicated in interval cancers is necessary . although the exact etiology of interval cancer is unknown , there are several potential explanations for such interval cancers . first , precancerous or cancerous lesions may have been missed at the time of colonoscopy.30 withdrawal time and technique deserve special consideration in this context , as the detection rate of colorectal neoplasia depends on the withdrawal time during colonoscopy . barclay et al.31 demonstrated that a withdrawal time 6 min is strongly correlated with an increased adenoma detection rate ( adr ) . in addition , careful inspection of the oral side of the mucosal folds is more important than simple adherence to a standard withdrawal time , especially in the proximal colon.32,33 the adr itself is also an important quality indicator for predicting the risk of interval cancers after screening colonoscopy . kaminski et al.17 demonstrated that the adr of endoscopist was significantly associated with the risk of interval cancer ( p=0.008 ) . endoscopies with an adr of less than 11.0% were associated with a 10.94-fold ( 95% ci , 1.37 - 87.01 ) higher risk of interval cancer than endoscopies with an adr of 20.0% or higher . complete colonoscopy , another quality indicator of']"

What are some of the autoimmune diseases that TNF antagonists have been effective in treating?,"TNF antagonists have been effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis.","rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis","[""tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf ) antagonists are an effective treatment for a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases , and they are commonly administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis . however , in some cases , treatment with tnf antagonists induces the onset of a new autoimmune disease . as these agents are being used for an expanding number of diseases and for longer periods , this phenomenon has also been increasingly noticed . these agents have been reported to induce lupus , vasculitis , interstitial lung disease , psoriasis , sarcoidosis , autoimmune hepatitis and myopathy [ 1 , 2 ] . sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas , and although it primarily affects the lungs and lymph nodes , any organ may be involved . induced sarcoidosis has been reported in association with infliximab , etanercept and adalimumab [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] . certolizumab is a new tnf antagonist which has been proven to be effective in the treatment of ra . a review of the literature revealed no previous occurrence of sarcoidosis induced by this agent . we report the first case of certolizumab - induced uveitis , highly suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis , and review the literature relevant to the pathogenesis of this adverse effect . a 64-year - old woman was referred to our clinic due to bilateral reduced visual acuity ( va ) , mainly in her left eye . the patient 's medical history was significant for seropositive ra , which had been well controlled for the previous 3 years under treatment with methotrexate and certolizumab ( cimzia ) . the patient complained of a mild reduction in va in both eyes during the previous year and noticed a significant reduction in her left eye ( which occurred 1 week prior to her presentation ) . initial examination revealed a va of 20/32 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye . anterior segment examination revealed no corneal keratic precipitates , mild ( + 1 ) flare in the anterior chambers and posterior synechiae bilaterally ( fig . dilated fundus examination revealed vitreal cells and haze , which were present bilaterally , but more distinct in the left eye . 1c , d ) and peripheral retinal punched - out lesions were visible ( fig . intraocular"", 'treatment of refractory sarcoidosis . it is therefore paradoxical that such agents would also induce sarcoidosis , but this complication has been previously documented [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] . tnf-induced sarcoidosis may not demonstrate all the systemic manifestations of the disease and may involve only 1 organ . several case reports have been published describing pulmonary [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] or cutaneous [ 10 , 11 ] sarcoidosis following treatment with tnf antagonists . it is a recombinant , polyethylene glycolylated , antigen - binding fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets and neutralizes tnf . infliximab and adalimumab are monoclonal antibodies directed toward tnf , and etanercept is a tnf - receptor - fusion protein conjugated to the fc portion of human igg . certolizumab is essentially different from these other tnf antagonists since it is not a full antibody and does not include an fc portion that may be immunogenic . our patient had no previous history of sarcoidosis and had not received any other tnf antagonists that may have induced it . the patient presented with 4 ocular signs of sarcoidosis ( synechiae , vitreous opacities , multiple peripheral chorioretinal lesions and a bilaterality of involvement ) , associated with a mildly elevated ace . according to the international criteria for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis , 3 suggestive intraocular signs and 2 positive investigational tests are required to diagnose a probable ocular sarcoidosis . since our patient had no other typical signs and only 1 positive test , a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis could not be made with any certainty , but it was evident that significant bilateral uveitis was present and the constellation of ocular findings and elevated ace are suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis . the fact that the onset of ocular involvement followed the initiation of certolizumab supports the observation that the uveitis was induced by this agent and improved after its cessation . although uveitis is a possible complication of ra , the ocular findings in this case are not typical for ra , but instead are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis . it is worthwhile to note that the simultaneous occurrence of ra and sarcoidosis is extremely rare . these facts further imply certolizumab as the cause of induced uveitis in this patient . following cessation of certolizumab , the macular edema', 'instead are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis . it is worthwhile to note that the simultaneous occurrence of ra and sarcoidosis is extremely rare . these facts further imply certolizumab as the cause of induced uveitis in this patient . following cessation of certolizumab , the macular edema did not resolve completely ; however , residual edema may persist after the inflammatory process is stopped , and in this patient , it is also possible that the presence of an epiretinal membrane precluded its complete resorption . the patient had a normal chest x - ray and pulmonary function ; only her eyes were involved in the induced inflammation . for this reason , there was also no way to perform a biopsy to pathologically demonstrate the diagnosis of sarcoidosis . it should be noted that sarcoidosis may involve any organ or it can be limited to the eyes only . the same is true for induced sarcoidosis , which may be limited to 1 organ [ 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] . for example , it has been reported to present very atypically and involve just the hypopharynx . this is the first case report of induced uveitis , suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis , secondary to treatment with certolizumab . ocular involvement associated with autoimmune disease induced by tnf antagonists is relatively rare , and ocular involvement from tnf-induced sarcoidosis has only been reported once . cessation of certolizumab resulted in gradual improvement and should be recommended in similar cases ; its use caused a new autoimmune disease . it should be noted that the patient required additional topical treatment as well as periorbital injections of steroids ; extraocular involvement may have required systemic therapy . rheumatologists and ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility of induced uveitis by tnf antagonists , and this case report demonstrates that this complication may also occur with certolizumab . rheumatologists should also be aware that it may only involve 1 organ and inquire about changes in va . they should refer their patients for an ophthalmic examination if any ocular involvement is suspected .', ""in the anterior chambers and posterior synechiae bilaterally ( fig . dilated fundus examination revealed vitreal cells and haze , which were present bilaterally , but more distinct in the left eye . 1c , d ) and peripheral retinal punched -

ir is expressed in various human thyroid cancer cell lines and in normal and neoplastic human thyroid tissues , including surgical specimens of papillary and anaplastic carcinomas . igf - ir antibody a12 was able to significantly inhibit the proliferation of cultured anaplastic cancer cells by downregulating the igf - ir signaling pathway . moreover , administration of a12 also reduced tumor volume in an orthotopic anaplastic cancer nude mouse model and prolonged survival ( table 2 ) . the ppar agonists thiazolidinediones and biguanides ( metformin ) are used as antidiabetic drugs for their insulin - sensitizing effect achieved by different mechanisms . because of these effects , both these classes of drugs lower circulating insulin levels , and , in principle , they may have favorable effects in patients with ir - overexpressing tumors . moreover , both thiazolidinediones and metformin have direct and pleiotropic anti - igf effects in cultured cancer cells . in particular , in anaplastic thyroid cancer ( atc ) cells , rosiglitazone antagonized the biological effects of igf -

dependent and -independent growth and migration , increased apoptosis rate , and induced partial redifferentiation in these cancer cells . recently , chen et al . evaluated the effects of metformin , in atc cell lines and in thyroid cancer stem cells . they found that metformin antagonized the growth - stimulatory effect of insulin in thyroid cancer cell lines . specifically , metformin inhibited cell cycle progression , inhibited clonal cell growth , and reduced thyroid cancer sphere formation . moreover , the metformin potentiated the antimitogenic effect of chemotherapeutic agents , such as doxorubicin and cisplatin , in atc cells ( table 2 ) . may produce glucocorticoids , androgens , mineralocorticoids , estrogens , and combinations thereof . the vast majority of adrenocortical tumors are benign , while']"

ray and pulmonary function ; only her eyes were involved in the induced inflammation . for this reason , there was also no way to perform a biopsy to pathologically demonstrate the diagnosis of sarcoidosis . it should be noted that sarcoidosis may involve any organ or it can be limited to the eyes only . the same is true for induced sarcoidosis , which may be limited to 1 organ [ 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] . for example , it has been reported to present very atypically and involve just the hypopharynx . this is the first case report of induced uveitis , suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis , secondary to treatment with certolizumab . ocular involvement associated with autoimmune disease induced by tnf antagonists is relatively rare , and ocular involvement from tnf-induced sarcoidosis has only been reported once . cessation of certolizumab resulted in gradual improvement and should be recommended in similar cases ; its use caused a new autoimmune disease . it should be noted that the patient required additional topical treatment as well as periorbital injections of steroids ; extraocular involvement may have required systemic therapy . rheumatologists and ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility of induced uveitis by tnf antagonists , and this case report demonstrates that this complication may also occur with certolizumab . rheumatologists should also be aware that it may only involve 1 organ and inquire about changes in va . they should refer their patients for an ophthalmic examination if any ocular involvement is suspected .', 'treatment of refractory sarcoidosis . it is therefore paradoxical that such agents would also induce sarcoidosis , but this complication has been previously documented [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] . tnf-induced sarcoidosis may not demonstrate all the systemic manifestations of the disease and may involve only 1 organ . several case reports have been published describing pulmonary [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] or cutaneous [ 10 , 11 ] sarcoidosis following treatment with tnf antagonists . it is a recombinant , polyethylene glycolylated , antigen -

fusion protein conjugated to the fc portion of human igg . certolizumab is essentially different from these other tnf antagonists since it is not a full antibody and does not include an fc portion that may be immunogenic . our patient had no previous history of sarcoidosis and had not received any other tnf antagonists that may have induced it . the patient presented with 4 ocular signs of sarcoidosis ( synechiae , vitreous opacities , multiple peripheral chorioretinal lesions and a bilaterality of involvement ) , associated with a mildly elevated ace . according to the international criteria for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis , 3 suggestive intraocular signs and 2 positive investigational tests are required to diagnose a probable ocular sarcoidosis . since our patient had no other typical signs and only 1 positive test , a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis could not be made with any certainty , but it was evident that significant bilateral uveitis was present and the constellation of ocular findings and elevated ace are suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis . the fact that the onset of ocular involvement followed the initiation of certolizumab supports the observation that the uveitis was induced by this agent and improved after its cessation . although uveitis is a possible complication of ra , the ocular findings in this case are not typical for ra , but instead are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis . it is worthwhile to note that the simultaneous occurrence of ra and sarcoidosis is extremely rare . these facts further imply certolizumab as the cause of induced uveitis in this patient . following cessation of certolizumab , the macular edema', ""a 31-year -

What is the role of determining a biomolecule's three-dimensional structure?,Determining a biomolecule's three-dimensional structure provides information about the molecule's function and how that function might be modulated.,The role of determining a biomolecule's three-dimensional structure is to provide invaluable information about the molecule's function and how that function can be modulated.,"[""the determination of a biomolecule 's complete three - dimensional structure provides invaluable information about the molecule 's function , and how that function might be modulated . unfortunately , determining protein or nucleic - acid structures from the molecules themselves is difficult owing to physical impediments . likewise , accurate computational prediction of such structures from physical principles remains computationally intractable owing to the overwhelming number of degrees of freedom in the system . techniques that can determine constraints on the potential molecular conformations can dramatically improve the chances of determining structures with both measured and predictive methods . one possible method for predicting physical proximity is to examine large families of sequences that have presumably similar structures , and to catalog positional pairs that show correlation between the identities of the residues occupying them . this calculation produces a four - dimensional matrix of positions , identities , related positions and strengths of relationship . for a small rna molecule of 80 nt , this 4d matrix contains 160 000 values , while a small protein of 300 amino acids produces a cross - correlation matrix containing 39 690 000 values . since there is no single value or distinctly definable pattern amongst these values that signals a structural relationship , an abstraction that allows the expert researcher to visualize , interpret and query the matrix is clearly necessary ( ) . mavl / stickwrld was developed to visualize interpositional dependencies within nucleic acid and amino acid sequence alignments ( 1,2 ) . in this representation , a positional weight matrix representing the alignment is wrapped around a cylinder by placing spheres for each identity and position . the diameters of the spheres are proportional to the percentage frequency of the corresponding identity . the diameter of the sticks is based on the over - representation or under - representation of sequences sharing these identities as compared with a weight - matrix - based expectation for the sequences as a family . this visualization method allows the researcher to detect patterns of pairwise positional dependencies easily , and comment on possible structural implications of these observations . in this paper , we present a complete rewrite of mavl / stickwrld in java3d ( ) . the new implementation has three significant areas of improvement over the vrml version : enhanced real - time user interaction ;

f and f0 are the fluorescence intensities of bsa in the presence of and in the absence of quencher , respectively ; r0 is the critical energy transfer distance when the transfer efficiency is 50% . k is a factor describing the spatial orientation factor related to the geometry of the donor and acceptor of dipoles ; n is the refractive index of medium ; is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor ; j is the effect of spectra overlap between the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor and the uv - vis absorption spectrum of the acceptor , and j can be calculated by ( 6 ) : ( 6)j = f()()4f() , where f( ) is the corrected fluorescence intensity of the donor in the wavelength range from to + and ( ) is the molar absorption coefficient of the acceptor at wavelength . in the present case , k = 2/3 , n = 1.311 , and = 0.118 for bsa molecules , respectively . and then , the values of j , e , r0 , and r were calculated and shown in table 6 . the binding distance is shorter than 8 nm which indicates that the energy could transfer from bsa to nabp with high possibility . in this work , we have presented the synthesis of novel benzamides related to schiff base in good yield and their spectroscopic characterization by"", ""acidic , and do not capture the sequence or property requirements , or suggest their involvement in stabilizing the hairpin . it is clear that the positively charged arginine and negatively charged glutamate are brought together by the hairpin , and can act in concert to stabilize the hairpin with the support of other polar and non - polar residues . while crystal or solution structures are not available for any non - proline - motif integrin alpha domains , we predict that the alternative positive residues at 8 and 10 , and negative residues at 11 and 15 will be found to interact similarly to stabilize the domain structure . mavl / stickwrld 's new java interface provides rapid exploration of alignment properties and insight into potential structural requirements that are embedded in the sequence identities . the analysis and visualization method has proven both intuitive and accurate for predicting likely structural features in protein and nucleic acid families for which representative crystal or solution structures are known . we are developing additional utilities to assist the researcher by providing automatic suggested partitions of sequence families into subgroups , and are actively extending our pre - computed analysis database so that researchers may mine other interesting structural features from the pfam families database . stickwrld graph representations of the integrin alpha cytoplasmic domain family alignments , and a corresponding domain solution structure .
