"although the basic principles of resuscitation were described by versalius more than 500 years ago , the practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in its modern form only starts 50 years ago .
despite advances in the understanding and practices of airway management , ventilatory support , external cardiac compression and drug therapy the outcome of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation remained poor .
patients may have spontaneous circulation restored and admitted to the intensive care unit , but then developed complications related to ischaemic insult to the brain as well as to the rest of the body .
the term post - resuscitation disease was coined by the russian resuscitologist vladimir a. negovsky in 1972 to describe the constellation of pathological processes caused by ischaemia and reperfusion associated with cardiac arrest and the subsequent resuscitation .
this is more recently renamed post - cardiac arrest syndrome   because "" the term resuscitation is now used more broadly to include treatment of various shock states in which circulation has not ceased ...
(and ) the term postresuscitation implies that the act of resuscitation has ended ... "" 4 key components contribute to the development of this syndrome : 1 ) post - cardiac arrest brain injury ; 2 ) post - cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction ; 3 ) systemic ischaemia / reperfusion response ; and 4 ) persistent precipitating pathology .
there is evidence to support that proper management in the post - resuscitation phase can improve outcome of these patients   and therapeutic hypothermia is one important component of such management . to avoid confusion , there is a need to define terminology used in relation to manipulation of body temperature : 
 hypothermia is defined as core body temperature of less then 36 regardless of the cause.induced hypothermia is defined as an intentional reduction of a patient 's core temperature below 36.therapeutic hypothermia is defined as controlled induced hypothermia ; i.e. induced hypothermia with the potentially deleterious effects such a shivering , being controlled or suppressed.controlled or therapeutic normothermia is defined as bringing down core temperature in a patient with fever , and maintaining temperature within a range of 36 - 37.5 , with the potentially deleterious effects such a shivering , being controlled or suppressed . 
 
hypothermia is defined as core body temperature of less then 36 regardless of the cause .
induced hypothermia is defined as an intentional reduction of a patient 's core temperature below 36. therapeutic hypothermia is defined as controlled induced hypothermia ; i.e. induced hypothermia with the potentially deleterious effects such a shivering , being controlled or suppressed . controlled or
therapeutic normothermia is defined as bringing down core temperature in a patient with fever , and maintaining temperature within a range of 36 - 37.5 , with the potentially deleterious effects such a shivering , being controlled or suppressed .
the degree of therapeutic hypothermia can mild ( 34.0 - 35.9 ) , moderate ( 32.0 - 33.9 ) , moderately deep ( 30.0 - 31.9 ) or deep (
early studies showed that induced hypothermia improved outcome in cardiac arrest patients . although both studies were small ( 12 patients had induced hypothermia in each study ) case series .
however , further progress was hindered by 1 ) lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology , 2 ) lack of reliable methods to control body temperature , and 3 ) lack of intensive care facilities to manage possible complications .
the early hypothesis that beneficial effect of hypothermia was due to reduction of metabolism leads to the adoption of more profound cooling ( around 30 ) .
the result was serious complications which can not be handled effectively without the support of intensive care , which was then only at its infancy .
further studies in the recent decades showed that the mechanism of cerebral protection by hypothermia is more complicated and neurological outcome can be improved by mild to moderate degree of hypothermia .
two studies published in 2002   provided the evidence basis that hypothermia can improve neurological outcome . coupled with advances in technology in hypothermia and intensive care in general ,
the study population of both the study by bernard et al .   and the haca study group   are patients suffering from out - of - hospital ventricular fibrillations .
there is evidence that cooling patients with presenting rhythms other than vf or vt following out - of - hospital arrests does no harm : 2 retrospective cohort studies found that the outcomes for patients presenting with pea / systole did not differ from those observed among the group presenting with vf or vt .
there is little published evidence to support the use of therapeutic hypothermia following in - hospital cardiac arrest .
an analysis of patients entered into arrich and erchacars group   found that 13% of procedures were performed post in - hospital cardiac arrest .
43% of these were cooled and although the initiation of hypothermia was faster than that for the out - of- hospital arrests , there was no difference in outcome between the patients treated with hypothermia and those with normothermia .
the haca in - hospital multi - center trial is currently investigating whether therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial for patients following in - hospital cardiac arrest . in both the haca and bernard studies , patients who are hypotensive ( map < 60 mmhg   or sbp < 90 mmhg despite adrenaline infusion ) were excluded .
the underlying reason being the possible deleterious effect of hypothermia on cardiovascular function and coagulation .
however , there are several publications suggesting that post - cardiac arrest patients in cardiogenic shock could actually also benefit from moderate therapeutic hypothermia .
reduction in platelet count and platelet dysfunction is noted when body temperature is dropped to < 35 ; and when temperature is below 33 , synthesis and kinetics of clotting enzymes and plasminogen activator inhibitors are also affected .
however , it was found in a recent study which assessed the risk and severity of bleeding during simultaneous use of mild hypothermia and thrombolysis that bleeding risks were similar to historical controls treated with thrombolytics alone , although there was a trend toward more red blood cell units being required to reach target hematocrit in hypothermic patients who developed bleeding complications and needed transfusions .
. the procedures of therapeutic hypothermia can be divided into 4 phases : induction , maintenance , de - cooling ( or rewarming ) and normothermia .
this is the initial phase during which the patient 's body temperature is lowered to the target of 32 - 34. continuous core temperature measurement should be started before induction of therapeutic hypothermia to ensure that the patient 's body temperature is within the target range and to avoid overshoot .
this is preferably achieved by bladder , rectal , central venous , or oesophageal measurement .
however , it should be noticed that bladder temperature may poorly reflect core temperature if the patient is oliguric , and other monitoring sites are preferred .
this phase is associated with many possible complications most of which can be minimized by rapid cooling .
rapid cooling can be achieved by rapid bolus administration of 30 to 40 ml / kg cold ( 4 ) isotonic resuscitation fluid over 1 hour . despite theoretical problems this method
when core temperature drops to 32 , metabolic rate decreases to 50 - 65% of normal .
the issue of how to interpret arterial blood gases in hypothermic patients ( alpha - stat versus ph - stat ) is a topic of some controversy and readers are referred to review articles for detailed discussion .
hypothermia can lead to hypokalaemia , hypophosphataemia and hypomagnesaemia as a result of intracellular shift as well as urinary loss because of tubular dysfunction .
it is particularly important to monitor and replace potassium in order to avoid arrhythmia . on the other hand ,
it is the result of increased fat metabolism , leading to an increase in the levels of glycerol , free fatty acids , ketonic acids , and lactate .
hyperglycaemia due to reduction of insulin secretion and insulin resistance should be controlled by close monitoring and insulin therapy .
the main sources of relevant data come from patients with hypothermia induced during cardiac surgery .
cardiac output decreased along with the heart rate ; however , the hypothermia - induced decrease in metabolic rate usually equaled or exceeded the decrease in cardiac output , so that the balance between supply and demand remained constant or improved . however , the actual cardiac output is also affected by the volume status and effect of sedation . systolic function of myocardium may actually be improved during mild to moderate hypothermia but diastolic function is usually impaired .
it is important to note that the effect of hypothermia on myocardial contractility is strongly dependent on heart rate . if the heart rate is allowed to decrease along with the temperature , myocardial contractility as measured by systolic function usually increases , although there may be a mild degree of diastolic dysfunction .
however , if the heart rate is artificially increased through administration of chronotropic drugs or a pacing wire , myocardial contractility decreases significantly .
this phenomenon has been demonstrated in animal studies and also in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery .
thus , the effect of hypothermia on myocardial function strongly depends on whether the heart rate is allowed to decrease [ 20 - 22 ] .
maintaining euvolemia is one important aspect of management during therapeutic hypothermia and one challenge is cold induced diuresis .
the underlying mechanisms leading to cold - induced diuresis include increased venous return caused by constriction of peripheral vessels ( particularly in the skin ) due to hypothermia - induced increases in plasma noradrenaline levels and activation of the sympathetic nerve system , activation of atrial natriuretic peptide , decreased levels of antidiuretic hormone and renal antidiuretic hormone receptor levels , and tubular dysfunction .
if uncorrected , diuresis can cause hypotension as well as electrolyte depletion and increase in blood viscosity .
the risk for hypovolemia increases significantly if the patient is simultaneously treated with diuretic agents such as mannitol .
however , hypotension can be quite easily prevented by avoiding or promptly correcting hypovolemia , and by avoiding excessive stimulation of heart rate .
while profound hypothermia of < 28 is associated with severe arrhythmia , mild to moderate hypothermia could stabilize membranes .
study in normal human showed that the threshold for vasoconstriction is about 36.5 and that for shivering is 35.5. the threshold is slightly higher in female but the difference is < 0.5 .
shivering of postoperative patients may lead to increased risk of morbid cardiac events especially in older patients with heart disease : the result of increased rate of metabolism and oxygen consumption , leading to excess work of breathing and tachycardia .
however , the situation may be different in sedated patients . while hypothermia in an awake patient causes tachycardia , inducing hypothermia intentionally in sedated patients
shivering will increase oxygen consumption , but as the patient is on mechanical ventilation , there will be no increase in the work of breathing . nevertheless , it is important to prevent or aggressively treat shivering because it significantly complicates hypothermia induction , and leads to an undesirable increase in metabolic rate and oxygen consumption .
shivering may be controlled by one and more of the following methods : 1 ) drugs lowering shivering threshold , e.g. acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) , aspirin , and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ; 2 ) drugs suppressing shivering response paralyzing agents , sedatives , opiates , and others ; and/or 3 ) skin counterwarming .
drugs lowering shivering threshold are not quite effective in general . of the drugs which suppress shivering
, it was found that there is significant variation in sedation protocols amongst the 68 icus included in the selected studies . midazolam
( 5 mg / h to 0.3 mg / kg / h ) being most commonly used , followed by propofol ( up to 6 mg / kg / h ) .
a quarter of icus do not use any analgesic , the rest use either fentanyl ( 0.5 - 10 mcg / kg / h ) or morphine .
use of neuromuscular blocking agents , however , is associated with several disadvantages some of which can be reduced by adequate sedation : 1 ) attempts of the brain to generate a shivering response will not cease ; 2 ) they can mask seizure ; 3 ) they lack of vasodilating effect of sedatives ; and 4 ) their use is associated with development of critical illness polyneuromyopathy .
the importance of adequate sedation and suppression of hypothermia - induced stress responses is underscored by observations from animal experiments suggesting that some or all of hypothermia 's neuroprotective effects can be lost if cooling is used in non - sedated animals .
it was found that 4 increase in skin temperature could "" compensate "" for 1 drop in core temperature to prevent a shivering response .
some areas of the body ( hands , feet and face ) have a higher concentration of "" temperature sensors "" and warming of those areas could have a greater effect on suppressing shivering . by reducing shivering , counterwarming can reduce metabolic rate and oxygen consumption of hypothermic patients .
during this phase , the goal is to maintain core temperature at 32 - 34 for 12 - 24 hours .
the patient is usually more stable during this phase with fewer disturbances in their haemodynamic , volume or electrolyte status , as well as less shivering .
however , the patient is subjected to other hazards including changes in pharmacokinetics , nosocomial infections and bedsores .
conventionally , patients are maintained cool by surface cooling through exposure , placing ice packs to the neck , groins and axillae , and/or spraying with water .
rubber cooling blankets can also be used but should be placed over the patient . placing those blankets under the patient can lead to skin damage due to vasoconstriction in already pressurized areas .
although widely available and inexpensive , conventional surface cooling is difficult to control as there is no internal feedback mechanism .
these may be classified as non - invasive surface cooling devices such as hydrogel - coated water circulating pads or water - circulating wrapping garments , and invasive core cooling devices using intravascular catheters .
a problem with surface cooling is that 40 - 90% the patient 's surface area needs to be covered and carries a risk of skin lesions .
but they can be started immediately using nurse - driven protocols without direct physician intervention .
core - cooling methods , on the other hand , are highly reliable once the catheter is in place , with a cooling rate of 2.0 - 4.5/hour .
however , insertion of catheter is required and it can lead to complications such as thrombosis and infection .
even short duration of hypothermia during perioperative period for intracranial aneurysm increase the risk of postoperative bacteraemia .
a study has shown that 3 days of prophylaxis with ampicillin - sulbactam can reduce early onset nosocomial pneumonia but not the incidence of late - onset nosocomial pneumonia .
after 12 - 24 hours of cooling , patient can be allowed to warm up slowly . the goal should be 0.2 - 0.33 per hour until the patient is 36.5 - 37.0. more rapid warming must be prevented to avoid electrolyte disturbance due to transcellular shift , hypoglycaemia due to increased insulin sensitivity , as well as aggravated brain destruction .
this can be prevented by slow rewarming , allowing the kidneys to excrete the excess potassium .
however , this should not be a reason to accept hypokalaemia in the induction or maintenance phase . for patients with renal dysfunction , renal replacement therapy
this may be the result of nosocomial infection or part of the post - cardiac arrest syndrome .
furthermore , cerebrovascular reactivity may be impaired following hypothermia treatment and thus increase the potential harmful effects of fever even more .
there was a case report in which a post - cardiac arrest patient who initially improved after rewarming deteriorated after development of fever and subsequently died .
it is recommended that patients should be maintained normothermic after decooling until 72 hours have elapsed since restoration of spontaneous circulation .
current evidence supports that induction of therapeutic hypothermia in selected patients after cardiac arrest can improve neurological outcome .
lack of familiarity and lack of a concrete protocol are the most important amongst the list of perceived barriers .
it is hoped that by summarizing the current state of knowledge on the subject and highlighting issues on clinical management will enable more patients to benefit from the therapy .","Introduction

"there is a pressing need for obesity interventions to address the growing prevalence of excess weight in the usa , especially among hispanics , one of the fastest growing racial / ethnic groups in america .
obesity is a common condition with associated risks of morbidity and mortality . according to data from the texas department of state health
, 68.3% of the hispanic population in the el paso region had a body mass index ( bmi ) of 25 or greater and 33.5% had a bmi of greater than 30 .
these numbers are greater than both the 2010 national ( 64.3% and 28.9% , respectively ) and texas averages ( 66.6% and 31.8% , respectively ) .
effective physician - centered obesity interventions could provide the solution to our nation s obesity epidemic and improve people s overall health .
physician centered counseling and intervention is associated with improved diet , physical activity , readiness for lifestyle change , and short - term weight loss .
studies have shown that even modest reductions in body weight of 5 - 10% , as opposed to achieving ideal weight , are associated with clinically significant improvements in health risk factors [ 5 , 6 ] .
while we know that obesity interventions can bring about positive results , many studies have shown physicians often do not provide adequate counsel to obese patients about their weight [ 7 , 8 ] .
previous attempts to understand why weight loss interventions are lacking have identified barriers reported by physicians such as lack of time for counseling , lack of resources for referral , limited training and competence , concerns about reimbursement , and beliefs about futility of treatment .
nguyen et al s study revealed that less educated , obese spanish speaking patients without comorbid conditions were less likely to receive weight loss advice .
this could indicate other possible barriers of language and time that physicians might face when working with hispanics .
while these studies provide some insight into physician perceptions about weight loss counseling , they offer little information about what weight management advice patients actually want or need from their physicians . to date , only a few studies have explored how patients in general perceive physician attempts at obesity intervention [ 9 - 11 ] .
potter et al found that patients believed that primary care physicians could help them lose weight and wanted more help than they were getting .
yet this study focused on the general population as a whole and only included hispanics that could read english .
brown et al s study found that some patients were reluctant to seek medical help due to their own personal sense of responsibility with their weight .
this study however was conducted in the uk and did not include any minority groups .
the results of their study highlighted the need for physicians to be culturally aware of potentially offensive techniques and terminology used to counsel african americans about obesity .
only recently have studies emerged gathering information on what hispanics think and believe when it comes to obesity management .
they have shown that hispanic immigrants expressed desire for weight loss programs that incorporate traditional foods , support cultural traditions , and include a family focus [ 12 - 14 ] .
common barriers to making long - term dietary changes were the social and family pressures to eat like others and partake in food - centered celebrations .
many of the studies also found a significant lack of information and a great deal of misinformation regarding nutrition and health among hispanics [ 12 - 16 ] .
these studies however did not focus on the health care system and how physicians could educate and facilitate weight loss . to our knowledge
, no study has focused specifically on obese hispanic patients perceptions regarding physician - guided obesity management .
whether physician - guided weight management treatments are effective and accepted by hispanic patients will depend on whether physicians are culturally compatible with patient needs and preferences .
this has been demonstrated in the past few years by studies implementing culturally appropriate lifestyle interventions among hispanics [ 13 , 18 ] .
the purpose of this study was to describe attitudes of hispanic patients towards weight loss , understand their prior experiences with their doctors , what they believe their doctor s role should be and exactly how they believe their doctor should help them to lose weight .
the assessment will be made through brief semi - structured interviews conducted in various health clinics throughout el paso .
once gathered , the information could prove invaluable to primary physicians as they work to effectively address the issue of obesity among their hispanic patients .
a cross - sectional study combining qualitative and quantitative methods was conducted to describe hispanic patients attitudes and beliefs about obesity and the role of their physician .
ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board ( e13030 ) .
participants were hispanic men and women , 18 - 75 years of age , overweight or obese ( bmi greater than 25.0 based on self - reported height and weight ) , who presented for a primary care visit for any reason .
a semi - structured interview guide was used to conduct an interview with each participant .
this interview guide was based on questions used in prior studies that have been used to identify thoughts , beliefs , and attitudes of patients regarding weight loss [ 9 - 11 , 19 - 21 ] .
four questions covered attitudes about weight loss [ 19 , 21 ] , six questions covered the role of physicians in weight loss [ 11 , 20 , 21 ] , three questions covered patients past experiences with a physician [ 10 , 19 , 21 ] and two questions elicited what patients wanted regarding weight loss counseling [ 10 , 11 ] .
two de novo questions regarding knowledge of and awareness of bmi were developed and included .
patients medical history , health status and demographic information were also collected by self - report .
participants were recruited by personal invitation from a trained bilingual research assistant during regularly scheduled clinic visits .
participants were approached in the waiting area of the clinic and asked if they were interested in participating , eligibility was then determined and if eligible they were taken to a private room where informed consent was obtained and the interview was conducted .
the interviewer took contemporaneous short notes and all interviews were recorded , transcribed and then translated into english by two separate translators and cross - checked for accuracy .
the free recall listing technique determines participants understanding of the definition and boundaries of a topic or domain of interest .
it is an open - ended interviewing technique in which participants , as a group , generate a list of responses in their own words .
free - recall lists have some important cognitive properties . in particular , items that are most salient to participants
are mentioned at the beginning of individual lists and also occur more often across interviews .
items that are not mentioned on the lists are not as salient as items that appear on the lists . interviewing more participants may increase the number of items , but the list itself becomes stable , and the order of items does not change as new items are added by each new person .
the interviews generate many items per participant , maximizing the amount of information collected per individual and allowing for a smaller sample size .
the interviewer and the observer recorded comments and phrases contemporaneously , in written format using the participant s own words .
the free - recall listing technique lends itself particularly well to transcribing verbatim because the responses are in list format and consist of short phrases or brief sentences .
we conducted a semantic thematic analysis   using a theoretical framework that was informed by prior work in this area [ 9 - 11 , 19 - 21 ] .
the coding and data analysis was done by the team on an ongoing basis throughout .
emerging themes were identified by separately reviewing responses to each question and listing unique themes mentioned by the participant .
data were summarized by tabulating the frequency with which themes were mentioned ; this is a method of presenting data obtained from the free - recall listing technique .

data were summarized by tabulating the frequency with which themes were mentioned ; this is a method of presenting data obtained from the free - recall listing technique .
the income level was primarily under $ 10,000 a year , with 65% of the group meeting this category ( table 1 ) .
very few mentioned that it affected medical conditions such as diabetes , hypertension , or cholesterol .
thirty percent knew what a bmi was and 95% reported that had never been told their bmi by their doctor .
most patients agreed that they thought their doctor should be involved weight loss but with varied roles .
some were not sure how the doctor could help since they themselves already knew what they needed to do or thought they knew what their doctor would say or do .
most agreed that their doctors did have the necessary knowledge and if they did not , they should
. about half of the patients replied that their doctors did not prioritize weight loss or were unsure of the priority because their doctor had never discussed weight loss with them .
nearly all patients said they had attempted to lose weight with either diet and/or exercise , and a few had undergone gastric bypass operations .
prominent obstacles to losing weight were identified as perceived high costs of a healthy diet , eating a bad diet , using food to cope with emotion or life changes , a lack of mobility , low energy and poor weight loss knowledge .
all of the patients were comfortable discussing their weight loss with their doctor and the healthcare team but had never broached the subject with their doctor .
a few mentioned that they only wanted their weight addressed if they were asked permission .
sixty percent of the patients remarked that their doctor had never discussed their weight with them .
participants reported that if their physician did mention weight loss , they gave very general tips such as eating less and being more active .
the most common preferences for physician assistance were specific information such as nutritional advice and specific weight loss goals , encouragement to continue progress , and referrals to nutritionists and weight loss experts .
common weight loss motivators and facilitators identified were encouragement from the healthcare team as well as having a support group or partners to join them in weight loss .

our data show that hispanic patients in this study want to lose weight and have tried in the past but have been unsuccessful due to a variety of barriers .
these findings are similar to those identified in past studies in other groups [ 9 , 12 , 14 , 23 ] .
while most hispanics in our group realized that excess weight played a role in decreased mobility and energy , not many were aware of the implications of excess weight on their current medical problems or overall health .
only a few patients realized that their excess weight had a direct impact on their medical issues .
regardless , it is worrisome that the majority of participants did not know the implications of weight on their direct health .
our findings are consistent with other studies in the overall lack of awareness of the health consequences of obesity in the hispanic population [ 15 , 16 , 23 ] .
this observation is important , since diabetes , hypertension , and coronary heart disease are highly prevalent among the hispanic population [ 1 , 24 ] .
so it is especially important for the physician and healthcare team to discuss weight management with patients with these conditions .
many of the patients interviewed had little understanding of what their ideal or healthy weight should be .
when asked to define bmi , only a third knew what it was while almost none had been notified about it by their doctor .
using bmi as a teaching tool could demonstrate clearly to patients how much excess weight they have .
interestingly , throughout our interviews many patients admitted they were  heavy  or  overweight  when in fact the majority fit the bmi criteria for being obese .
similar findings from another study showed that us - born obese hispanics were more likely to perceive themselves as overweight and desire to weigh less than their foreign - born counterparts . using bmi
could provide patients a clear view of where they currently are in their weight status while also providing goal oriented steps to gain a healthy weight .
overall , participants felt comfortable talking about their weight with their doctors or any member of the healthcare team .
we found that hispanic patients trust their doctors and believed they had the knowledge necessary for the health problems they faced .
they believed that if weight did affect health , a doctor has a responsibility to bring it up .
however , for 60% of our interviewees , the topic of weight loss had never been discussed by their physicians .
this lack of weight loss discussion made about 50% of our interviewees believe that their doctors did not put weight loss as a priority in their health .
some studies have shown that when physician interventions are done , they focus only on those morbidly obese or those with comorbidities [ 8 , 9 ] . from our results , we believe that if doctors made weight loss intervention a priority in their exam regardless of the lack of comorbidities , patients would understand the importance of maintaining a healthy weight allowing prevention of further weight gain . in our study , we found that similar to patients from other races / ethnicities , hispanic patients want detailed information such as specific nutritional advice and need specific goals to help them achieve their proper weight .
when physicians do not have the time or the knowledge to discuss weight loss intervention , patients want referrals to nutritionists and weight loss experts .
we were able to obtain a fair amount of responses to our open - ended surveys to the point that responses became saturated with similar themes .
while we are aware that such a small sample size could not possibly represent the variety of views found in the hispanic population , it does provide a good basis for future study .
it is possible that the results obtained could very well be one - sided as they represent a specific demographic that frequents the local health clinic .
looking forward we will need to administer the next phase of our study to a much larger sample size to adequately asses the attitudes , experiences , and desires of the hispanic population concerning weight loss .
the results of our study demonstrate that the attitudes , experiences , and desires of the hispanic population concerning weight loss intervention with physicians , resemble those observed among other groups .
our findings highlight the need for physicians to specifically educate and provide resources to their patients not only concerning the effects of excess weight on health but also where their patients currently stand in their bmi .
the hispanic patients in our study wanted more help and advice from their doctors in the form of dietician referrals , specific weight loss goals , and encouragement throughout the process .
we strongly believe that continued research into understanding how hispanic patients can be helped by their physicians will lead to improved weight loss management and overall healthcare of the hispanic community .

"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by relentless loss of motor neuron function .
the selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons results in progressive weakness of the limb , bulbar , abdominal , and thoracic muscles . the reported annual prevalence and incidence rates of als were only 9.9 and 2.3 per 100,000 people per year respectively in asian country , japan .
however , the importance of als should not be underestimated since there are more than one in 500 people who will die of the disease in the industrialized world . without mechanical ventilation , most patients die within 2 to 5 years after symptom onset because of respiratory failure , although 5% to 10% of patients may live more than 10 years . up to now , riluzole was the only drug approved by the food and drug administration as neuroprotective treatment / disease - modifying treatment for als that has been shown to slightly slow the course of als .
oral administration of riluzole 100  mg daily for als patients is reasonably safe and prolongs a limited lengthening of median survival by 2 to 3 months after 18 months treatment . to our knowledge ,
other than riluzole , there are no other new treatment that can halt or reverse the progressive loss of neurons , leading to an increase of the als life expectancy . given
the fatalness of the illness and lack of effective neuroprotective treatment / disease - modifying agents , complementary and/or alternative medicine ( cam ) is thus increasingly sought to treat als worldwide .
traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) is a main form of cam originating in ancient china and has been practiced for a history of 3000 years .
accordingly , chinese herbal medicines ( chms ) are frequently used in the treatment of als .
studies in vivo and in vitro showed that chms have a great potential for treatment of als , with neuroprotective function against excitatory amino acid toxicity , oxidative stress , calcium cytotoxicity , and neuroinflammation . during song dynasty ( 9601279 ad ) , the tcm prescription book shengji zonglu
( complete record of sacred benevolence ) compiled by zhao ji who was the eighth emperor of song dynasty of china in 1111 to 1117 ad .
this book lists 20,000 tcm prescriptions and describes the causes , symptoms , and cures for different diseases .
dihuang yinzi ( dhyz ) , a classical tcm prescription for neurological disorders yinfei syndrome that centered on the symptoms of the speech and language disorders such as aphasis and logopathy ( yin syndrome ) and disorders of motility such as motor paralysis and difficulty in walking ( fei syndrome ) , was first recorded in this book with the name dihuang yin .
it is composed of 12 kinds of chms : ( a ) radix rehmanniae preparata 15  g ; prepared rehmannia root ( shudihuang ) , the dried roots of radix rehmanniae recens ; ( b ) fructus corni 15  g ; asiatic cornelian cherry fruit ( shanzhuyu ) , the dried ripe pulp of cornus officinalis sieb .
( c ) herba cistanches 15  g ; desertliving cistanche ( rousongrong ) , the dried roots of cistanche deserticola y. c. ma ; ( d ) radix morindae officinalis 15  g ; morinda root ( bajitian ) , the dried roots of morinda officinalis how . ;
( e ) radix aconiti lateralis preparata 15  g ; prepared common monkshood branched root ( fuzi ) , the processed root of aconitum carmichaeli debx . ;
( f ) cortex cinnamomi 15  g ; cassia bark ( rougui ) , the dried bark of cinnamomum cassia presl ; ( g ) herba dendrobii 15  g ; dendrobium ( shihu ) , the dried roots of dendrobium loddigesli rolfe . or dendrobium fimbriatum hook
. var . oculatum hook . or dendrobium chrysanthum wall . or dendrobium officinale kimra et migo or dendrobium nobile lindl .
; ( h ) radix ophiopogonis 15  g ; dwarf lilyturf tuber ( maidong ) , the dried roots of ophiopogon japonicus ( thunb . ) ker - gawl . ;
( i ) fructus schisandrae chinensis 15  g ; chinese magnoliavine fruit ( wuweizi ) , the dried ripe fruit of s chinensis ( turcz . ) baill . ; ( j ) rhizoma acori tatarinowii 15  g ; grassleaf sweetflag rhizome ( shichangpu ) , the dried roots of acorus tatarinowii schott . ;
( k ) radix polygalae 15  g ; milkwort root ( yuanzhi ) , the dried roots of polygala tenuifolia willd . or polygala sibirica l. ; ( l ) poria ; indian bread ( fuling ) 15  g , the dried sclerotia of poria cocos ( schw . ) wolf .
( table 1 ) . in modern times , dhyz is still used continuously and widely for treatment of neurological disorders such as stroke , parkinson disease dementia , and spinal cord injury . here
, we reported a case of als patient using modified dhyz who has survived 12 years with significant improvement in bulbar paralysis .
on 31 july 2004 , a 41-year - old chinese han nationality woman was admitted to the hospital with complaints of weakened bilateral grip , slurred speech , stumbling , and muscular twitchings for 3 years . the initial symptom , the intermittent weakness of right upper limb without numbness and pain , appeared in november 2001 .
after 6 months , uncontrollable twitching was observed in the right upper limb and the patient 's speech became slurred . on 5 march 2002 ,
the electromyography ( emg ) done at the huashan hospital affiliated to fudan university showed neurogenic injury in bilateral upper limbs and tongue ( table 2 ) . based on the revised el escorial criteria , clinically als was diagnosed .
the patient was orally administrated with riluzole ( 50  mg , twice a day ) for 10 months .
she stopped the riluzole by herself because symptoms continuously deteriorated and could not bear the economic burden . on 31 july 2004
, she was admitted to the hospital with weakness of limbs , dysarthria , dysphagia , and the clumsiness in daily activities . on examination ,
the four main vital signs , temperature , heart rate , blood pressure , and respiratory rate , were normal .
motor system examination showed widespread muscle wasting and fasciculation of the bilateral thenar and interosseous muscles .
strength in the distal muscle of the upper bilateral limbs was of grade 2/5 to 3/5 and muscle strength in the lower bilateral limbs was of grade 3/5 to 4/5 , graded on the medical research council muscle strength grading system .
the bilateral hoffman signs were present , whereas the bilateral babinski signs were not present .
tcm symptoms and signs were summarized as follows : sluggish speech , faint low voice , choke when drinking , weakness of limbs , muscle wasting of hands , muscular twitchings of upper limbs , pale facial complexion , soreness and weakness of waist and knees , excessive phlegm and saliva , constipation once every 3 days , pink tongue quality , tongue muscle atrophy and fibrillation , deep weak and thready pulse . the electromyography examination
atrophy and fasciculations , the onset symptom is insidiously developing asymmetric upper limb weakness and then bulbar muscle .
the clinical features are accompanied with the pathological signs : overactive tendon reflexes and clonus .
based on the revisited el escorial criteria , she was diagnosed with clinically definite als , depending on the clinical manifestations and consistent electrodiagnostic studies .
when the patient experienced bulbar paralysis with symptoms such as dysarthria and dysphagia , the clinical features were classified to yin syndrome in tcm .
the kidney meridian dominates feet , throat , and tongue according to meridian theory of tcm .
thus , the kidney deficiency leads to yinfei syndrome affecting both bulbar muscles and limbs muscles . following the tcm theory ,
the patient was diagnosed with yinfei syndrome because of kidney deficiency . once the patient was diagnosed with als firstly in 2002 ,
she was started on riluzole ( 50  mg , twice a day ) for 10 months . when she noted that the treatment can not arrest the disease condition and she can not bear the economic burden , the patient discontinued treatment because riluzole is not a cure for als . in that time

after 12-year treatment and follow - up , no obvious adverse event occurred during the treatment period .
in addition , the patient still survived with als and does not require permanent continuous ventilator till today ( figure 1 ) .

( a ) the patient 's appearance ; ( b ) the patient 's tongue muscle atrophy ; ( c ) the patient 's feet ; ( d ) the patient 's palms .
this is a long - term follow - up study on a case with als treated by tcm prescription .
a middle - aged woman was diagnosed with als based on the revised el escorial criteria . after consuming orally administrated riluzole 100  mg daily for 10 months
, she stopped this drug and then started dhyz that she has been using for 12 years .
the main findings were that dhyz therapy for als may potentially improve bulbar paralysis , delay use of ventilator support , and prolong survival time ; there were fewer adverse effects .
approximately 90% of als cases are sporadic , but the remaining 10% of the cases are familial .
the mean age of onset is 58 to 63 years in sporadic and 43 to 52 years in familial cases of als .
only 5% of the cases of als have an onset  < 30 years of age .
an increased risk in the sex incidence ratio was male : female  =  1.5:1 . in the present case ,
a female suffering from als was of age 38 years in sporadic who presented with limb onset and subsequently bulbar symptoms .
als is primarily a clinically diagnosed disease because of the lack of an established biological marker .
diagnosis of als is usually straightforward according to the progressive , generalized symptoms in the limb and bulbar regions .
this can result in a delay in diagnosis because als inclines to be focal in onset presented with few clinical signs in the early disease course .
the mean lag time between the onset of symptoms of als and confirmation of the diagnosis is 10 to 18 months . in 1994 ,
the el escorial criteria for diagnosing als clinically were published by a subcommittee on als of the world federation of neurology and the revisited criteria were revised in 1999 , which included the clinical neurophysiolgical measurements as diagnostic tools to exclude differential diagnosis . in 2006 ,
the awaji criteria placed equal emphasis on both electromyographic evidence of degeneration and clinical abnormalities , thereby potentially enabling an earlier secure diagnosis of als , and this criterion has successfully increased in sensitivity to detect patients with als but additionally showed that this is achieved without increasing the number of false - positives . in 2015 , an updated version of el escorial criteria for the diagnosis of als was published with the purpose of both clinical practice and clinical trial .
the new diagnostic criteria of als require at least one of the following : ( 1 ) progressive upper and lower motor neuron deficits in at least one limb or region of the human body ; that is , that is meeting the revised el escorial criteria for possible als ; ( 2 ) lower motor neuron deficits as defined by clinical examination ( one region ) and/or by emg in two body regions ( defined as bulbar , cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral ) .
the emg findings consist of neurogenic potentials and fibrillation potentials and/or sharp waves . in the present study ,
the patient was diagnosed with als according to revised el escorial criteria 2000 and confirmed both clinical and electrophysiological evidences during long - term follow - up .
repeated investigations were required and the diagnosis can be confirmed with disease progression over time . in the initial emg , the damages of different extents occurred in motor nerves which were controlled by neurogenic changed muscle of the patient .
motor conduction velocity in the upper and lower limbs was almost normal despite the amplitude decreased in the initial and repeated examination , because the primary abnormality of the peripheral nerve was axonal loss , rather than demyelination .
it is critical that tongue innervated by a cranial nerve demonstrated evidence of acute reinnervation confirmed the diagnosis for the positive changes of resting potential , for example , fibs and wave . from the repeated emg
, we can find motor conduction amplitude reducing gradually and velocity not changing more when compared with the initial emg . despite advances in the treatments and interventions ,
there are no medications that stop or reverse the progressive loss of motor neurons of als because of uncertainty on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying degeneration of motor neuron .
riluzole remains the only available neuroprotective / disease - modifying drug for als , with only marginal effects on disease survival .
although still incurable , als is not untreatable . over the past two decades , remarkable progression in integrative and aggressive supportive care
in addition , emphasis has been made in therapies that may even improve the disease course of als .
presently , als is considered as a complex disease with broad pathophysiological framework and numerous theories , including oxidative stress , glutamate and neuronal cytotoxicity , protein aggregation , mitochondrial impairment , cytoskeletal disruption , inflammation , apoptotic cell death , and altered regulation of gene expression .
thus , combined therapies that focus on more than one pathogenic pathway may slow disease progression in multiple targets / organs interactions .
impressively , the key to tcm prescription is to choose a combination of chms guided the combinatorial principle of sovereign - minister - assistant - envoy according to the patient 's syndrome in order to regain the balance state of body functions . over the past decades
, many experimental and clinical studies demonstrated tcm prescriptions ; herbal components may have multiple targets and exert neuroprotection or treatment of als .
for example , dhyz possesses neuroprotective and antidementia properties through preventing the loss of neural cells and synapses in rats of ischemic brain injury .
many studies have demonstrated that each ingredient or its active components of dhyz exerted potential neuroprotective functions ( table 1 ) .
rehmannia root and catalpol have antioxidation , antiapoptosis , antiinflammation , and other neuroprotective properties and act in neuroprotection of neurodegenerative diseases.p - coumaric acid , ursolic acid , and gallic acid from corni fructus exerted antioxidation , antiapoptosis , and antineuroinflammation against a-induced toxicity .
herba cistanches and its active components possess neuroprotective function , hormone regulation , immunomodulatory , antioxidative , antiapoptotic , and antiinflammatory activities , making them potential treatment for various neurodegenerative disorders .
- d - fructofuranosyl ( 22 ) -d - fructofuranosyl from radix morindae officinalis enhanced antioxidative activity , antiapoptotic activity , and energy metabolism against a-induced neurotoxicity .
cortex cinnamomi has a neuroprotective effect on glutamate - induced neuronal death through the inhibition of ca influx ; 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde has antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system by targeting lipoprotein receptor - related protein 1 .
an active compound from dendrobium and chrysotoxine exhibit antioxidant , antiapoptosis , and neuroprotective activities against neurotoxion - induced cell death.o japonicus displays antiinflammatory , antioxidative , and immunomodulative activities .
schisantherin a , schisandrin b , and schisandrin c from fructus schisandrae chinensis attenuate abnormal oxidative stress and modulate the apoptotic signal pathway , exhibiting their neuroprotective function on neurodegenerative diseases .
-asarone and eugenol , components of rhizoma acori tatarinowii , have neuroprotective function cells through inhibiting apoptosis against a- induced neurotoxicity .
polygalae radix has neuroprotective effects against toxin - induced neuronal death through its antioxidant and antiapoptotic activities ; its ethanol extracts as a novel autophagy inducer modulate neurodegenerative disorders via reducing toxicity and clearing of mutant proteins in the cellular level.p cocos water extract has neuroprotective action against a-induced neuronal injury through suppressing the oxidative stress and the apoptosis . in conclusion , we reinforce that tcm prescription , especially dhyz , can be potentially used in als patients because of its multitargeted neuroprotection and general safety , although als has not a cure .
in addition , we identified the area that is worthy of further study and dhyz as a promising candidate for further clinical application and als trials .","INTRODUCTION

"glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) is secreted from the enteroendocrine l cells of the intestinal mucosa and is released into the portal circulation in response to meal ingestion   through posttranslational processing of proglucagon by prohormone convertase-1 in its secretory cells .
glp-1 enhances insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon release in a glucose - dependent manner , prompting the development of glp-1-based therapies for the treatment of diabetes .
glp-1-based diabetes therapies affect glucose control through several mechanisms , including slowed gastric emptying , regulation of postprandial glucagon , reduction of food intake , and enhancement of glucose - dependent insulin secretion without the risk of hypoglycemia
. however , the clinical responsiveness to glp-1 analogues varies among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , which suggests that genetic factors may be crucial in the pharmacological responsiveness of these patients . in order to establish the correct treatment protocols in clinical practice and taking into consideration the high cost of these new drugs , it is important to clarify this critical issue in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . among genetic variants ,
the diabetes - associated variants in tcf7l2 ( rs7903146 ) and wfs1 ( rs10010131 ) have been shown to affect the response to exogenous glp-1 , while variants in kcnq1 ( rs151290 , rs2237892 , and rs2237895 ) have been reported to alter endogenous glp-1 secretion [ 68 ] .
however , a validation study showed no effect regarding variants in tcf7l2 , kcnq1 , and wfs1 on glp-1 concentrations after a standard 75  g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) or glp-1-induced insulin secretion in healthy subjects without diabetes .
the glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor ( glp1r ) specifically binds glp-1 and related peptides with a lower affinity such as the gastric inhibitory polypeptide and glucagon .
the glp1r is a member of the class b1 family of g protein - coupled receptors , and polar interactions ( hydrogen bonds or salt bridges ) between glp1r and agonists have recently been predicted .
some glp1r gene polymorphisms have been found to be related to the strength of these interactions .
however , the relationship between these polymorphisms and the responsiveness to glp-1 analogue treatment has yet to be explored .
pharmacogenetics has the potential to increase benefits and reduce side effects in patients whose drug responses are not average , and possibly to tailor treatments for these outliers .
a previous study reported that differences in the insulinotropic response to exogenous glp-1 in healthy volunteers depended on the presence or absence of two common polymorphisms of the glp1r gene .
however , the relationship between these single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) and the effect of glp-1 analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has not yet been established .
currently , glp-1 analogues are most often used for patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus .
however , the overall general control rate is not good which may be partially due to the complex etiology involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus .
furthermore , the lack of normal beta cell secretary function is emphasized in modern practice .
therefore , the effect of glp-1 analogues could be affected by various beta cell functions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . in order to study the effect of a glp-1 analogue in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus , we first optimized insulin therapy in this study
. continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( csii ) or an insulin pump is a viable choice for patients with diabetes mellitus who require close - to - physiologic insulin treatment . with insulin pump therapy provided during hospitalization
it is possible to standardize the sugar control profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a short period of time , thereby allowing for the further evaluation of the clinical response to glp-1 analogues . to investigate the relationship between the snps of glp1r and the effectiveness of glp-1 analogue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
, we performed exon resequencing of the glp1r gene in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus who were treated with a glp-1 analogue in this study .
thirty - six patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled into this study from 2011 to 2013 .
the inclusion criteria were ( a ) age > 20 years ; ( b ) diabetes mellitus diagnosed > 2 years ; ( c ) a1c level of 8% to 12% ; and ( d ) receiving premixed insulin twice daily with a total insulin daily dose of > 0.6  u / kg / day .
the exclusion criteria were ( a ) recent history of drug or alcohol abuse ; ( b ) sensitivity to analogous products ; ( c ) serious cardiovascular disorders ; ( d ) participation in another clinical investigation study ; ( e ) ongoing influenza , autoimmune disease , or other metabolic disorders ; and ( f ) pregnant or lactating women .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of the chang gung memorial hospital and registered with clinicaltrials.gov ( nct01473147 and nct02026024 ) . written informed consent was obtained from all subjects .
a finger - stick test was performed to examine premeal ( ac ) and 2-hour postmeal ( pc ) glucose levels after three meals in addition to bedtime and nocturnal glucose levels for a total of 8 measurements a day .
the glucose level was normalized in the first 3 days , and the patients received a combined therapy with exenatide 5  g twice daily for the remaining 3 days .
the responsiveness to the glp-1 analogue was evaluated by the standard deviation of plasma glucose ( sdpg ) , mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( mage ) , and mean glucose compared to the baseline .
the 75  g ogtt was performed at baseline and at the end of the study to assess the insulin sensitivity index and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance [ 16 , 17 ] .
we stopped pharmacological treatment for at least 12 hours ( premixed insulin after the evening dose ) before performing the 75  g ogtt at baseline . to eliminate the effect of ultra - short acting insulin , aspart , in the use of csii
, the 75  g ogtt was performed 2 hours after csii had been stopped ( end of the study ) .
the insulin regimen was switched from premixed insulin to csii according to a previously described hospital - based protocol [ 18 , 19 ] . in brief , the prepump total daily dose of insulin was used as the starting dose of csii .
half of the dose was infused continuously as the basal dose , and the other half was divided for each meal as the bolus dose .
the basal insulin dose was then titrated as precisely as 0.1  u per hour to maintain the blood glucose targets in the range of 90140  mg / dl from bedtime throughout the nocturnal period , and at 70140  mg / dl before each meal .
the bolus insulin dose was titrated up or down carefully by 1  u for a fixed amount of carbohydrates to maintain the postprandial glucose range between 70 and 180  mg / dl . we found that using 50% of the total daily dose as the basal insulin dose was usually an overestimation among our patients .
therefore , we focused on reducing the basal infusion rate to prevent hypoglycemia and increased the bolus dosage for a fixed amount of carbohydrates during meals .
all of the patients received an adequate adjustment based on this 3-day titration protocol . at the end of the study , the switch in treatment of twice - daily or multiple - daily injections in csii was equal to the divided total daily insulin dose or the total daily basal dose and respective premeal bolus dose according to a recommended protocol .
the medical team included diabetologists , educators , and dieticians , who were all on call to manage any unexpected occurrences during hospitalization .
genomic dna was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood from the 36 patients according to the manufacturer 's recommendations ( genomic dna extraction kit , rbc bioscience , taiwan ) .
pcr was performed to amplify the promoter , all 13 exons and intron - exon boundaries of the glp1r gene ( genbank accession number al035690 ) using specific primer sets and pcr conditions as described in supplementary table  1 , in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/176949 .
all of pcr products were confirmed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and directly sequenced using an automated sequencer abi 377 ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) to determine the dna sequences .
differences between groups with regard to continuous variables were tested using student 's t - test .
differences in proportions were assessed using a chi - square test or fisher 's exact test , as appropriate .
multiple linear regression analyses using additive genetic models were performed to adjust baseline variables and conducted with spss 20 ( ibm spss inc . ,
the level of statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05 or less .
all statistical analyses were conducted using the matlab program , version r2013a ( mathworks inc . ,
the mean age , gender , mean bmi , duration of diabetes mellitus , and a1c levels are shown in table 1 .
the mean glucose , sdpg , and mage were significantly decreased after glp-1 analogue treatment ( 180.2  5.4 versus 147.9  3.8  mg / dl , p < 0.001 ; 65.1  3.3 versus 50.7  3.0  mg / dl , p < 0.001 ; and 123.9  6.5 versus 98.8  6.4  mg / dl , p = 0.001 , resp . )
( homa - ir ) and insulin sensitivity index ( isi ) were not significantly different after glp-1 analogue treatment ( p = 0.343 and 0.570 , resp . ) .
nineteen snps around the exon region of the glp1r gene were identified according to allele frequency ( > 0.2 ) in the 36 patients ( supplementary figure  1 ) . among these 19 snps
, we chose the reported missense snp ( rs3765467 )   and the only one dinucleotide repeat polymorphism ( rs5875654 ) for comparison .
the rs5875654 was a short tandem repeat ( str ) with 2-base - pair deletion of 8ga/7ga .
the genotype of the 8ga/7ga variant was decomposed with the mixed sequence reader program   and further confirmed by pcr cloning following sequencing analysis ( figure 1 ) .
the rs5875654 and rs761386 snps showed complete linkage disequilibrium ( ld , with r = 1 ) .
the allele frequencies of these 3 missense and silent variants were depicted in table 2 . by analysis of the quantitative trait loci for other clinical variables
, the two snps rs3765467 and rs761386 were found to be significantly associated with changes in the standard deviation of plasma glucose ( sdpgbaseline  sdpgtreatment with glp-1 analogue ) in the enrolled patients ( p = 0.041 and 0.019 , resp . )
the clinical characteristics of the subjects according to the recessive genotype subgroups are summarized in supplementary table  2 and all clinical variables were not significant between subgroups except for the sex distribution of rs3765467 .
however , the results remained the same and there was no change after adjusting for the sex variable .
in particular , the t allele of rs3765467 and rs761386 was found to be associated with an opposite sdpg change ( lower in rs3765467 and higher in rs761386 ) after glp-1 analogue treatment .
the association of the sdpg change with rs3765467 and rs761386 by multiple linear regression analyses using the additive genetic models with adjustment of age , sex , bmi , and glycemic states at baseline also demonstrated the same trend ( table 3 ) .
the mean glucose and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions at baseline , treatment , and the change between the two time - points showed no significant differences between rs3765467 and rs761386 ( supplementary figures  2 and 3 ) .
the association data of the remaining 16 common variants with each trait is shown in supplementary table  3 .
the effects of glp1r genotypes on glucose , insulin , and c - peptide concentrations during the 75  g ogtt after glp-1 analogue treatment are shown in figure 3 .
the ( ct / tt ) recessive model of rs761386 showed significantly higher glucose levels at 120 minutes of the 75  g ogtt ( p = 0.032 ) ; however the insulin and c - peptide levels were not significantly different between the two genotypes throughout the ogtt for both rs3765467 and rs761386 .
the associations of the glucose , c - peptide , and insulin changes with rs3765467 and rs761386 by multiple linear regression analyses using the additive genetic models with and without adjustment of age , sex , bmi , and glycemic states at baseline showed no significance ( table 4 ) .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to reveal the relationship between genetic variations of glp1r and the response to a glp-1 analogue in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , although the number of enrolled cases in this study is limited .
based on our understanding of the characteristics of the glp-1 analogue , exenatide , added to csii during hospitalization , we could evaluate the real response to the glp-1 analogue in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus by excluding variable residual beta cell function .
the combination of exenatide and insulin has previously been evaluated in clinical trials [ 22 , 23 ] . in a placebo - controlled trial ,
another randomized trial examined the replacement of insulin with exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes and found that glycemic control deteriorated in 38% ( 11 of 29 ) of the patients who received exenatide compared with 19% ( 3 of 16 ) of the patients who continued insulin .
the patients who lost glycemic control were more likely to have a longer duration of disease , lower c - peptide concentrations ( suggesting less endogenous beta cell function ) , and larger insulin requirements at baseline .
however , the combined use of basal - bolus or csii and exenatide could maintain minimal beta cell function and potentiate the clinical effect of exenatide .
the 3-day conditioning period with csii treatment is short compared to the time spent in the general outpatient therapy .
but our protocol followed the suggestion of pump therapy in the previous report . in this hospital based practice , we could simply focus on reducing the basal infusion rate to prevent hypoglycemia and increasing bolus insulin dosage for the fixed carbohydrate amount in meals . for the limitation of the total of one week of hospitalization
, we could make use of the 3-day conditioning period with csii treatment to efficiently detect the effect of glp-1 analogue in these poorly controlled patients with type 2 dm .
three snps have previously been associated with a response to infused glp-1 or glp-1 concentrations in response to an oral challenge ( table 5 ) [ 12 , 14 ] .
a previously published report showed that heterozygotes of the minor allele of rs3765467 were associated with an increase in glp-1 response in healthy volunteers .
however , there were no significant differences in clinical response except for a lower sdpg change in the current study . ethnic diversity and the characteristics of the participants may be reasons for this discrepancy . as shown in figures 2 and 3 , a significant difference in sdpg change after glp-1 analogue treatment was found between subgroups of genotype rs3765467 despite there being no significant differences in glucose , insulin , and c - peptide level on ogtt .
the effects of glp-1 analogue involve both beta cell and non - beta cell responses .
based on the results of this study , the variant of rs3765467 had an impact on sdpg change after glp-1 analogue treatment favorably through the effect of non - beta cell related function , for example , glucagon suppression .
the finding that there were no differences in glucose , insulin , and c - peptide levels in ogtt just reflected the lesser impact of this variant on the beta cell secretion .
the expression of a nonsynonymous snp ( rs367543060 ) , which results in the substitution of methionine for threonine at position 149 of glp1r in cell systems , has been documented to decrease binding affinity for glp-1 and intracellular signaling after hormone receptor binding [ 12 , 25 ] .
the thr149met mutation was detected only in the proband among subjects with type 2 diabetes ( 1/791 ) but not in controls in a study from japan .
although the minor allele frequency data is not available at present , the variation of t149 m of glp1r was not detected in our enrolled patients . in the current study , the presence of the dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the str ( 8ga/7ga ) of the glp1r gene was nominally associated with altered glucose control with the use of a glp-1 analogue .
the significant snps in this study were located within intronic noncoding regions , and therefore the mechanisms of their actions remain elusive .
recent studies have reported that variants in tcf7l2 ( rs7903146 ) and wfs1 ( rs10010131 ) , which have been shown to affect the response to exogenous glp-1 , and variants in kcnq1 ( rs151290 , rs2237892 , and rs2237895 ) , which have been demonstrated to alter endogenous glp-1 secretion , are all identified in noncoding intron regions [ 69 , 26 ] .
given that none of the chosen snps were located in coding regions , these genetic variants in glp1r may affect gene expression but not the function of the gene product .
the actions of glp-1 ( primarily stimulation of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon secretion ) are mediated by binding to its cognate receptor .
exenatide , a glp-1 receptor agonist , binds to the glp-1 receptor with greater affinity than its natural ligand due to a nine - amino - acid cooh - terminal sequence that is absent in native glp-1 .
the substitution of glycine for alanine at position eight of native glp-1 has been reported to decrease its affinity for the receptor , suggesting that both n- and cooh - terminal ends of glp-1 bind the receptor .
the application of chimeric glp-1/gip peptides together with molecular modeling suggests that his of glp-1 interacts with asn of glp1r , and that thr of glp-1 has close contact with a binding pocket formed by ile , leu , and met of glp1r .
the location of the str related to the unresponsiveness of the glp-1 analogue is around the coding region in exons 9 - 10 responsible for the binding sites .
further studies assessing the function of gene regulation may help to clarify the relationship of this novel genetic variation and drug response .
one of the limitations of this study is the lack of data on the impact of long - term a1c control for the genetic variants of glp1r .
however , having well - controlled blood sugar management by csii during the hospitalization period could help to further clarify the different pharmacological effects of the glp-1 analogue in this type of patient .
although the reported p values became insignificant after multiple testing adjustments , the small sample size due to clinical difficulties in keeping patients hospitalized might not allow for such a statistical correction .
future large - scale studies aiming at elucidating the contribution of glp1r genetic variations to glp-1 analogue response will need to take into account the likelihood of the small effects of these variants on the quantitative traits to ensure that they are adequately powered to reproducibly determine such effects . while it is certainly possible that these variants had smaller effects on glp-1 analogue - induced responses in this study , the clinical application of screening for genotype 7ga/7ga in rs5875654 and t / t in rs761386 could reveal which patients would be unresponsive to the glp-1 analogue .
it is important to develop approaches that help to effectively manage the use of expensive drugs in current modern incretin - based therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus and to control unnecessary expenses .
the variable response to a glp-1 analogue was not statistically correlated to the polymorphisms of the glp1r gene in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus .","1. Introduction

"epidemiological data indicate that adverse life events during the first few years of life can increase the risk for psychopathology , including drug addiction [ 1 , 2 ] .
in fact , early life stress has been proposed to predict alcohol drinking in adolescence and alcohol abuse and dependence at adulthood ( see   for review ) .
alcohol dependence affects millions of people worldwide , and alcohol consumption at adolescence has reached alarming rates . in rodents ,
the effects of early life stress can be studied in a controlled manner by removal of the dam during the first 2 weeks of life ( for a review on the animals models of dam - litter interaction disruption , please consult [ 57 ] ) .
the effects of early life stress on alcohol consumption currently available are inconsistent and highly dependent on environmental factors such as the species and strains used and the protocol used for the maternal separation protocol ( see   as an example ) . in rats ,
repeated maternal separation during early postnatal life ( 180360  min . a day during the first three weeks of life ) has been reported to induce an increase in alcohol intake [ 912 ] , although no changes in alcohol consumption have also been reported [ 1315 ] .
it is worth mentioning that the investigation of possible sex differences in this regard has been neglected . in the last years
, we have focused on the investigation of the early maternal deprivation ( md ) animal model , that is , 24  h of dam - litter separation on postnatal day ( pnd ) 9 .
adolescent animals exposed to md have been reported to exhibit a trend to increased impulsivity , depressive - like responses , and impairments in cognitive function [ 1618 ] . at adolescence ,
an increase in striatal dopamine levels has also been reported as a consequence of md , possibly reflecting an altered brain reward system .
actually , md seems to modify the response of animals to diverse drugs of abuse , including cannabinoids [ 7 , 18 , 20 ] , 3,4-methylenedioxymetamphetamine ( mdma ) , and cocaine .
there is evidence about a relationship between stress and alcohol consumption ( see [ 23 , 24 ] for review ) although the nature of this relationship is far from being understood . at this point
, it is worth mentioning that , in a previous study , alcohol consumption during adolescence rendered animals more susceptible to acute stressor - specific effects in terms of alcohol consumption .
therefore , in the present study alcohol deprivation was employed as a potential stressful stimulus that may influence motivation to drink [ 26 , 27 ] , and alcohol deprivation was also combined with restraint stress since exposure to restraint stress has been reported to increase alcohol consumption in rats . in the present study we aimed to analyze the effects of md on adolescent alcohol consumption , as well as
addressing to which extent a previous history of early life stress ( md ) could modulate the consequences of subsequent stressful life events ( alcohol deprivation and alcohol deprivation combined with the concomitant exposure to restraint stress ) on voluntary alcohol intake .
given the amount of evidence supporting sex differences in the consequences of md , both male and female animals were employed in the present study .
experiments were performed in agreement with the european directive 2010/63/eu on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and in compliance with the spanish royal decree 1201/2005 , october 21 , 2005 ( boe n 252 ) , about protection of experimental animals .
experiments were carried out on the offspring of rats purchased from harlan laboratories ( rossdorf , germany ) , which were mated ( one male  two females for ten consecutive days ) in our animal facilities approximately 2 weeks after their arrival . after mating , female rats were housed individually in standard plexiglas cages ( 50  25  17.5  cm . ) and the animals were monitored daily for parturition . on the day of birth , postnatal day ( pnd ) 0 , the litters were culled and sex balanced to 8 pups per dam ( 4 males and 4 females ) . no cross - fostering was allowed .
litters were randomly assigned to each experimental group : control ( co ) and maternal deprivation ( md ) .
all pups were weaned at pnd 22 and housed in pairs of sibling rats separated by sex .
all animals were maintained in our animal facilities at the faculty of biological sciences in the complutense university of madrid ( ex08-ucs ) at a constant temperature ( 21  1c ) and humidity ( 60  10% ) in a reverse 12-hour dark - light cycle ( lights on at 20.00  h ) , with free access to food ( commercial diet for rodents a04/a03 ; safe , augy , france ) and water .
early md was performed as previously described . in brief , on pnd 9 , litters were submitted to 24 hours of maternal deprivation ; that is , dams were removed from their home cages at 09.00  h , pups were weighted and remained undisturbed in the same room until the next day ( pnd 10 , 09.00  h ) when pups were weighted again , and dams were placed back in their corresponding home cages .
pups from the control group ( co ) were not manipulated but for body weight control on pnd 9 and pnd 10 .
body weight was registered every six days until weaning ( on pnd 16 and pnd 22 ) .
a total of 10 litters were used in the present experiment ( 5 co litters and 5 md litters ) ; however , due to a technical mistake , 2 cages from the md group had to be excluded from the study , and thus the total number of animals used was 76 ( 20 co males and 20 co females and 18 md males and 18 md females ) . once the rats became adolescents ( pnd 28 ) , rats were given free access to a bottle containing an ethanol solution ( 20% v / v ) in addition to the water bottle . the ethanol solution ( v / v )
measurements of alcohol and water intake were made daily during the recording periods , as well as body weight .
voluntary alcohol intake was recorded ( 1 ) during adolescence , from pnd 28 to pnd 50 ; ( 2 ) during a four - day period after one week of alcohol cessation , from pnd 57 to pnd 60 ; and ( 3 ) during a four - day period after a second period of alcohol cessation combined with exposure to restraint immobilization stress ( 30  min . per day under white light conditions ) on the last three days of alcohol cessation , from pnd 67 to pnd 70 .
the amount of alcohol intake was expressed as grams ( g. ) and alcohol intake per body weight ( kg . ) .
daily voluntary alcohol consumption was calculated during the three recording periods , and alcohol intake during the first 2  h. of alcohol exposure was also evaluated for the two last periods following exposure to additional stress ( see experimental schedule for details , figure 1 ) .
body weight and food intake were controlled throughout the experimental period . during the evaluation of alcohol consumption animals remained paired housed to avoid possible interferences with the md protocol due to isolation [ 28 , 29 ] .
food intake was evaluated by placing a known amount of food in each cage and measuring the remaining amount after 24 hours .
this procedure was performed during the adolescent period ( voluntary alcohol consumption ) and after the first and second alcohol cessation periods .
body weight was registered at pnd 9 , pnd 16 , and pnd 22 ( before weaning ) and daily thereafter during the periods of voluntary alcohol consumption , that is , adolescence , and following alcohol cessation .
body weight ( bw ) gain ( in grams ) was analyzed and calculated as the difference in bw referenced to pnd 9 during the preweaning period , pnd 28 during adolescence , and pnd 50 during the two periods of alcohol cessation .
additionally , growth rate ( gr ) was calculated as the percentage of bw gain divided by the reference bw employed during each period : gr ( % ) = ( bw gain / bwref . )
data were analyzed using a two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) , considering sex ( male or female ) and neonatal condition ( co or md ) as independent factors .
shapiro - wilk and levene tests were used to confirm normality and homoscedasticity of the data . repeated measures anova was employed when appropriate , that is , bw gain and growth rate .
tukey post hoc comparisons were performed only for significant interactions , as well as additional one - way anovas .
statistical analyses were performed by the spss 19.0 software package ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) .
no significant differences in alcohol intake were found during voluntary alcohol consumption at adolescence ( control males : 16.6  1.9  g / kg / day ; control females : 17.2  1.9 
neither the repeated measures anova nor the anova analysis of the averaged alcohol intake during adolescence revealed any significant difference ( see figure 2 ) . however , it is worth mentioning that md females showed a trend for increased levels of alcohol intake during the first days of alcohol exposure .
following one - week cessation , no significant differences were found on daily voluntary alcohol consumption ( data not shown ) .
however , a significant effect of the neonatal condition was found during the first 2  h of alcohol exposure ( f(1,34 ) = 4.48 ; p < 0.05 ) .
both male and female animals consumed more alcohol than their corresponding co animals during the first 2  h of alcohol exposure ( figure 3(a ) ) .
although not significant , a trend for higher levels of alcohol consumption was found for female animals when compared to males during these first 2  h of alcohol exposure ( f(1,34 ) = 3.79 ; p = 0.06 ) .
no significant interaction between sex and neonatal condition was found . following a second period of alcohol cessation combined with restraint stress during the last three days , no significant differences were found on daily voluntary alcohol consumption ( data not shown ) .
however , a significant effect of the neonatal condition was found during the first 2  h of alcohol exposure ( f(1,34 ) = 5.47 ; p < 0.05 ) .
md animals exhibited a higher alcohol intake than co animals during the period of alcohol exposure ( figure 3(b ) ) . during this time period , a significant effect of sex appeared ( f(1,34 ) = 5.30 ; p < 0.05 ) .
as for the previous time period , females showed higher levels of alcohol consumption compared to males during the first 2  h of alcohol exposure .
no significant interaction between sex and neonatal condition was found . during the preweaning period ,
a significant effect of the neonatal condition was found when analyzing bw gain ( f(1,16 ) = 89.88 ; p < 0.001 ) and growth rate ( f(1,16 ) = 20.58 ; p < 0.001 ) . neither a significant effect of the sex condition nor a significant interaction between factors was found .
the md episode induced a significant reduction in bw gain and growth rate during the preweaning period ( table 1 ) . during adolescence , when animals had free access to alcohol , bw gain ( figure 4(a ) ) and growth rate ( figure 4(b ) ) were significantly affected by sex ( f(1,72 ) = 281.62 ; p < 0.001 ; f(1,72 ) = 97.26 ; p < 0.001 , resp . ) and neonatal condition ( f(1,72 ) = 6.47 ; p < 0.05 ; f(1,72 ) = 28.88 ; p < 0.001 , resp . )
. no significant interaction between sex and neonatal condition was found . as expected , female animals showed lower bw gain and growth rate than male animals , while md animals showed a lower bw gain but a higher growth rate than control animals .
the analysis of accumulated food intake rendered a significant effect of sex ( f(1,34 ) = 104.78 ; p <
0.001 ) with females eating less than males and a significant effect of the neonatal condition ( f(1,34 ) = 11.57 ; p < 0.005 ) with md animals consuming less food than their corresponding controls ( figure 4(c ) ) .
a significant effect of sex on bw gain was found after the first ( f(1,72 ) = 501.87 , p < 0.001 ) and second ( f(1,72 ) = 683.69 ; p < 0.001 ) periods of alcohol cessation , with females showing a lower bw gain than males across periods ( data not shown ) .
similarly , the analysis of growth rate ( figures 5(a ) and 5(c ) ) revealed a significant effect of sex after the first ( f(1,72 ) = 242.03 , p < 0.001 ) and second ( f(1,72 ) = 341.55 ; p < 0.001 ) periods of alcohol cessation .
moreover , the analysis of growth rate also revealed a significant effect of the neonatal condition after the two alcohol cessation periods ( first period : f(1,72 ) = 7.30 ; p < 0.01 and second period : f(1,72 ) = 14.65 ; p < 0.001 ) . for the growth rate analyses , a significant interaction between sex and neonatal condition was also found ( first period : f(1,72 ) = 8.14 ; p < 0.01 and second period : f(1,72 ) = 8.62 ; p < 0.005 ) . during the two periods of alcohol exposure
, female animals showed a lower growth rate than male animals , but md only increased growth rate among male animals ( no differences were observed among females ) .
regarding the analysis of the accumulated food intake ( figures 5(b ) and 5(d ) ) , a significant effect of sex was revealed ( first period : f(1,34 ) = 210.18 ; p < 0.001 and second period : f(1,34 ) = 162.40 ; p < 0.001 ) ; males consumed more food than females during these two time periods .
a significant effect of the neonatal condition was also found after the second period of alcohol cessation ( f(1,34 ) = 6.29 ; p < 0.05 ) ; during this period md animals consumed less food than control animals .
no significant interaction between sex and neonatal condition was found for any of the time periods analyzed .
early life stress , in the form of a single 24-hour episode of md at pnd 9 , did not affect baseline voluntary alcohol intake during adolescence in rats of both sexes .
however , md seemed to exacerbate the effects of subsequent stress exposure on alcohol intake .
animals exposed to neonatal md , compared to control non - md animals , showed higher levels of alcohol intake following a short period of alcohol cessation as well as after the combination of an additional period of alcohol cessation concomitant to restraint stress exposure . under the present experimental conditions ,
md , per se , did not appear to predict prospective alcohol intake during adolescence in either sex .
previous studies have investigated the impact of early life stress on voluntary alcohol intake , but different protocols of maternal separation were employed , that is , repeated and shorter episodes of maternal separation , and it is well known that different experimental procedures of this model of early life stress render different results .
moreover , most of the previous studies have investigated the effects of early life stress on adult animals , leaving adolescents out of the focus .
following repeated brief episodes of neonatal maternal separation , some studies reported an increase in alcohol intake [ 912 ] , although other studies found no changes in alcohol consumption [ 1315 ] .
discrepancies with previous reports may result from the timeframe selected for alcohol exposure , that is , adolescence ; the protocol of early life stress employed , that is , md ; and differences in the protocol of alcohol exposure , that is , previous alcohol habituation , alcohol concentration , and/or choice between two or more bottles . however , present findings suggest md animals to be more vulnerable to the acute effects of stress in terms of later alcohol consumption .
in fact , md animals showed higher levels of alcohol intake than control animals following a short period of alcohol cessation , and an additional short period of alcohol cessation combined with restraint stress .
a previous study reported an increase in voluntary alcohol intake in adolescent animals exposed to a protocol of repeated maternal separation by using a paradigm of intermittent free access to alcohol . since the paradigm of alcohol exposure employed in that study included brief periods of alcohol withdrawal ,
also considered as stressful stimuli ( see below ) , those results could be considered similar to our present findings .
alcohol withdrawal has been considered as a potent stressor capable of disrupting several stress circuitries including the hpa axis   and has been proposed as a suitable model to study the impact of alcohol reexposure on relapse . moreover , a previous study that investigated the vulnerability of animals to the consequences of stress on alcohol intake revealed that alcohol deprivations in combination with more severe stress protocols , that is , electric foot shock , were able to increase alcohol consumption if animals had initiated alcohol intake during adolescence .
similarly , roman et al .   reported an increase in alcohol intake during the exposure in adult life to a restraint protocol and throughout the postrestraint period in male and female animals exposed to repeated periods of brief maternal separation .
the relationship between stress and alcohol consumption is complex and poorly understood ( see [ 23 , 24 ] for review ) ; however , present data suggest that early life stress and in particular md may render animals more vulnerable to the consequences of future stressful situations regarding alcohol intake .
early life stress has been associated with alterations in the development and establishment of several neurotransmitter circuitries involved in the stress response . as an example , md has been reported to alter the development of the dopaminergic , serotonergic , and glutamatergic systems , known to be involved in alcohol effects and vulnerability [ 19 , 32 , 33 ] .
a disruption of the endogenous cannabinoid system has also been reported as a consequence of md [ 17 , 3438 ] .
the endocannabinoid ( ecb ) system appears to be of special interest in the context of the present study since it has been proposed as one of the underlying mechanisms of alcohol use and abuse   and , more recently , as a putative candidate for the proclivity to alcohol intake observed in animals submitted to certain protocols of maternal separation .
therefore , the changes induced by the md episode on the ecb system may possibly underlie the increased alcohol intake reported after the exposure to stressful challenges later in life . in humans ,
epidemiological studies indicate higher rates of alcohol abuse and dependence in men compared to woman .
however , data from animal models show the opposite ; female animals seem more prone to consume alcohol than males [ 42 , 43 ] . discrepancies between human and animal studies may result from sociocultural factors , but the investigation of the underlying neurobiological substrates may help us to better understand these sex differences . in the present study ,
female animals consumed more alcohol than males in a two - bottle choice paradigm following an episode of alcohol cessation combined with restraint stress . since sex differences in the response to stressors
have been extensively described [ 44 , 45 ] , a differential response to stress in male and female animals might underlie , at least in part , the greater influence of stress on alcohol intake in females .
as in previous studies from our group , md animals showed a significantly diminished bw gain until weaning when compared to co animals [ 36 , 46 , 47 ] , as well as a significantly decreased growth rate .
however , these growing profiles changed after weaning . during adolescence , when animals had free access to alcohol , md animals still showed lower bw gain than control animals , but they also showed a higher growth rate than controls .
these results suggest that md animals gain less body weight but they did it faster than control animals .
the higher growth rate was accompanied by a decrease in food intake , suggesting an altered body weight regulation in md animals that is evidenced in adolescence , coincident with alcohol exposure .
it is worth mentioning that later in life , as evaluated following the exposure to stressful events , that is , alcohol cessation and alcohol cessation combined with restraint stress , only among male animals did the effects of md on growth rate persist .
though a specific effect of weaning on the different growth rate of control and md animals can not be ruled out , it is important to point out that md modifies the metabolic response to a metabolic challenge such as a high fat diet . from this point of view
, the present data may indicate that md alters the metabolic response to alcohol , apparently in a sex dependent manner , though a direct confirmation of this hypothesis would require further experiments .
we have previously reported that md rats show a long lasting leptin deficiency ( observed in neonates and adult rats ) as well as an altered hypothalamic development [ 47 , 49 , 50 ] .
recently , de timary et al .   have proposed a model for disruption of energy balance in alcohol dependent subjects in which altered leptin levels play a central role .
the interactions between metabolic alterations induced by early life stress and those induced by alcohol abuse deserve further investigation , since adaptations of energy balance may contribute ( aside from the effects of alcohol on the brain reward system ) to the modulatory effects of md on stress - induced alcohol intake .
early maternal deprivation did not affect baseline voluntary alcohol consumption during adolescence but enhanced the levels of voluntary alcohol intake following exposure to stressful events later in life . moreover ,
this episode of early life stress seemed to alter energy balance and metabolism since somatic growth and food intake were persistently modified in these animals .
future research is needed in order to clarify the impact of metabolic changes , such as altered leptin levels , on the susceptibility to increase alcohol intake in response to stress .","1. Introduction

"most of the time teeth with periapical lesions heal satisfactorily after non - surgical endodontic intervention .
however , we do come across cases with persisting symptoms and infection that require periradicular surgery in order to remove the pathological tissues and to eliminate the source of irritation , and promote healing .
abramovitz et al . , have discussed the case selection for apical surgery and non - surgical re - treatment .
they have reported that treatment of 24.5% of the cases was impossible without surgical therapy .
the key to tissue regeneration is to simulate a cascade of healing events that , if coordinated , can result in the completion of integrated tissue formation .
this is possible only with the use of growth factors , extracellular matrix , and the use of bone morphogenetic proteins instead of routinely used synthetic bone grafts , because synthetic bone grafts induce regeneration by osteoconduction , whereas , these biological modulators induce regeneration by osteoinduction .
the need for these biological modulators resulted in the development of platelet - rich plasma [ prp ] by whitmen et al .
platelet - rich plasma is the component of blood with concentrated platelets in a limited volume of plasma .
this autologous plasma is a rich source of growth factors and its application is thought to be an effective way of inducing tissue repair and regeneration .
marx et al . , in 1998 , reported the first clinical dental results with prp and they suggested that adding prp to bone grafts accelerated the rate and degree of bone formation .
platelet membranes had been shown to stimulate the mitogenic activity of human trabecular bone cells .
the proliferation rate of human osteoblast - like cells was increased , up to a certain level , by adding thrombocytes .
recent studies have indicated the stimulator influence of prp in collagen biosynthesis and proliferation of osteoblastic cells .
these in vitro results have supported the current assumption that the clinical use of prp might enhance bone regeneration.[914 ] the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the bone regeneration in endodontically induced periapical lesions using hydroxyapatite , platelet - rich plasma , and a combination of both , for a period of one year .
twenty systemically healthy patients of both genders , between the ages 20 and 40 years , were included .
the procedure was explained to the patients in their own language and informed consent was obtained from them .
to qualify , the patient had to have a tooth where non - surgical root canal therapy had failed , periapical radiolucency was present , and periapical root - end surgery was required .
the bony defect had to be confined to the apical area with the bone covering the entire root surface coronally and had an intact lingual cortical plate .
the patients were randomly divided into four groups of five patients each : group i  replacement with hydroxyapatite ( periobone g , top notch health care product , india .
batch no : pb01040006 ) , group ii  replacement with prp , group iii  replacement with prp and hydroxyapatite , and group iv  control group with no substitutes .
ten milliliters of venous blood was drawn from the patient and transferred into two test tubes containing ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid ( edta ) as an anticoagulant .
the plasma was then aspirated with a micropipette and transferred to a sterile test tube without an anticoagulant .
the samples of plasma were subjected to a second centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes , which allowed the precipitation of the platelets ( 0.8 to 1.2 ml ) to fall onto the bottom , while the surface platelet poor plasma was discarded using a micropipette .
the prp was transferred to a dappen dish and stored at room temperature until further use . just before placing the prp into the bony cavity
, a small amount of bovine thrombin ( dade behring test thrombin reagent , germany ) and a few drops of 10% calcium chloride [ obtained by mixing 1 g of calcium chloride in 10 ml of distilled water ] were added to the prp to form a gel in a few seconds [ figure 1 ] .
this preparation of the prp gel was conducted by another operator during the surgical procedure .
platelet - rich plasma gel the first step of the treatment plan was to complete the root canal therapy in cases where dry canals existed and in others obturation was done on the day of surgery .
the surgical procedure included reflection of a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap by sulcular incision and two relieving vertical incisions .
debridement of tissues at the defect site was followed by irrigation with sterile saline solution .
root planing was performed on the root surface under the apical portion of the root .
for group i patients , the hydroxyapatite crystals were mixed with the patients own blood and thoroughly compacted into the bony defect until it reached the level of the periphery of the bone margins .
for group ii patients , the prp gel was carefully placed into the cavity till the entire cavity was filled [ figure 2 ] . for group iii patients ,
then hydroxyapatite crystals were mixed with the remaining prp and were packed into the defect as a second layer .
bony cavity filled with platelet - rich plasma gel wound closure was obtained with a 3 - 0 black silk suture .
analgesics ( combiflam [ aristo ] { ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 325 mg } twice a day ) , antibiotics ( amoxycillin 500 mg [ alembic pharma ] twice a day ) and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash ( hexidine , icpa health products ) , was prescribed for five days post surgically .
the patients were reviewed at regular intervals of one week , and one , three , six , nine , and twelve months . during the review
, radiographs were taken using the paralleling cone technique ( rwt rontgenfilmhalter mit langtubus , kkd , d-7090 ellwangen ) .
all these cases were evaluated clinically and radiographically . clinically , the patients were assessed for edema , postoperative pain , signs of infection , untoward reaction , and wound dehiscence .

clinically , all cases showed moderate edematous swelling 24 hours after the surgery , which gradually subsided over a period of five days .
there were no signs of infection , untoward reaction , wound dehiscence or extrusion of material in any of the patients .
radiographically , group i patients showed complete bone regeneration , with evidence of a trabecular pattern at the end of one year , group ii patients showed complete bone regeneration at the end of nine months , group iii patients showed complete bone regeneration at the end of six months and group iv patients showed bone regeneration , which was not satisfactory even after one year [ figures 310 ] .

today , while non - surgical endodontics is considered as the primary mode of treatment , the decision to intervene surgically is open to deliberations .
the success of an endodontic procedure depends upon complete healing of the lost periapical tissues .
however , some may require surgical intervention to remove the pathological tissue and simultaneously eliminate the source of irritation that could not be removed by the orthograde root canal treatment .
hence , to enhance these processes a number of bone substitutes are being tried out .
the objective of using a bone graft is to achieve successful and complete healing of the bone .
a variety of materials are available for bone regeneration , which are highly osteoconductive or osteoinductive like , freeze dried bone graft , bioactive glass , emdogain , ptr polymer , mta , tricalcium phosphate , and octacalcium phosphate .
blood and blood products have been used for over a century for various purposes , including the use of serum and individual components .
since the early twentieth century , various functions of platelets have been known , such as , hemostasis and platelet - plug formation .
research regarding the active use of growth factors present within the platelets started in the middle of twentieth century .
these studies began to explore the fact that platelets could be used to modulate regeneration , and to repair and heal the tissues . in 1997 , whitman et al .
, showed prp as an autologous source of platelet derived growth factor ( pdgf ) and transforming growth factor - b ( tgf ) that was obtained by sequestering and concentrating platelets by gradient density centrifugation .
platelet gel was prepared by blood collection preoperatively , and was prepared by another operator during surgery .
platelet rich plasma contain various growth factors namely pdgf , transforming growth factor  , insulin - like growth factor , and epidermal growth factor .
these factors play a prime role in bone regeneration the various advantages of prp are : 
 improved support of tissue healingmore rapid mineralization of collagen in bone repairearlier stability of grafts because of the sticky consistency of fibrin componentcytokines and growth factors brought to the siteformation of a firm nonfriable clotclevatage of fibrinopeptides a and b from a molecule caused by thrombin , resulting in the formation of fibrin monomer , thrombin activated factor xiii that in turn allowed for a linkage in the presence of ionized calciumno potential for disease transmissionless thrombogenic than untreated graft materialminimal adhesion formation resolving in four to six monthsenhanced osteoconduction : osteoblasts were normally non - motile cells , in that , they would not move across a distance greater than 0.4 mm ( 400 microns ) , prp enhanced the fibrin network , and the movement of osteoblasts along the fibrin network was enhanced resulting in a woven bone formation , much earlier than normal .

switch through which the reception as well as bone formation occurred and acted as a modulator stem cells in the graft started the cascade of osteogenesis hydroxyapatite is used , as it helps in osteoconduction .
osteoconduction is a process wherein the bone is formed by the in - growth of capillaries and osteoprogenitor cells from the recipient bed into , around , and through a graft .
these hydroxyapatite crystals when used act as a scaffold upon which new bone is deposited , which is then followed by a slow resorption of the graft .
prp is used , as it helps in better healing and faster regeneration , because of the biological modulators and also helps in osteoinduction .
prp acts as an osteoinductive material because osteoinduction is a process whereby new bone is produced in an area where there was no bone earlier , where one tissue or its derivative causes another undifferentiated tissue to differentiate into a new bone .
calcium chloride is added to nullify the effect of the anticoagulant edta , and bovine thrombin is added to gellate the plasma . as only small grains of thrombin
are added , it does not produce any antigenic response , as proved by neil winter bottom et al . , in the year 2002 .
a number of methods have been used for the procurement of prp , such as : 
 electromedic 500 gradient density cell separator ( medtronics ) by marx et al . , in 1998smart prep by bhanot and alex , in 2002elmd 500 transfusion system by whitman and green , in 2002.automated systems like placon 7 and hemonetics mcs 
  electromedic 500 gradient density cell separator ( medtronics ) by marx et al .
, in 1998 smart prep by bhanot and alex , in 2002 elmd 500 transfusion system by whitman and green , in 2002 .
automated systems like placon 7 and hemonetics mcs the method used in this study to procure prp and prp gel was based on the test - tube or manual isolation techniques ( vacutainer system ) by sonnenleit and sullivan et al .
radiographic evaluation in group i ( periobone g ) showed increased radio - opacity immediately , due to the compaction of the bone graft into the defect . in the first month
there was reduction in volume of the material due to initiation of resorption of the bone graft . in the third month
there was diffuse radio - opacity due to increased calcification of the graft . in the sixth and ninth months
, bone regeneration was seen , but not complete , due to partial resorption of the graft . in the first year
there was complete bone regeneration due to osteoconduction as explained earlier . in group ii ( prp ) the immediate ,
first week and first month postoperative radiographs showed a radiolucency similar to that of the preoperative radiograph , as prp was a radiolucent material . in the third and sixth months bone regeneration was evident , but not complete , due to the presence of biological modulators as discussed earlier . in the ninth month bone regeneration was complete . in group iii ( prp and periobone g )
there was an increase in radio - opacity immediately , due to the compaction of the bone graft into the defect .
in the first month there was reduction in volume of the material due to initiation of resorption of the bone graft . in the third month
there was evidence of bone regeneration , but not complete , due to partial resorption of the graft . in the sixth month bone regeneration was complete because of the combined effect of periobone g and prp . in group iv ( control )
there was incomplete bone regeneration , even at the one - year follow - up , due to nonavailability of bone substitutes to induce osteoconduction . in this
study the grafts did not produce any adverse reactions . wound healing and primary closure of the surgical site were good .
today 's understanding of the bone science recognizes the pivotal role of the growth factor in the clinical bone grafting success .
this study elucidates the mechanism of action and the points of influence that the fundamental growth factors of pdgf and tgf- exert on bone regeneration .
the amplification of pdgf and tgf- through the technique of platelet sequestration and concentration into prp is seen as an available and practical tool for enhancing the rate of bone formation and the final quality of the bone formed .
under the conditions of this in vivo study , it can be concluded that : 
 the use of bone substitutes helps in rapid and qualitative bone regeneration when compared to natural healinghydroxyapatite crystals facilitated bone regeneration , but not to the extent of the other two tested groups ( prp and combination)plasma - rich platelets with biological modulators showed better results , but a combination of prp and hydroxyapatite showed the best resultsin a clinical situation the use of bone substitutes will definitely enhance periapical regeneration

"lowering blood pressure to values below 140/90  mm hg is of great value for patients with essential hypertension . for those with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or renal impairment ,
the target should even be lower , but with the available antihypertensive drugs , many patients either can not obtain full control of their hypertension with medical therapy alone or can not tolerate the adverse effects of the treatment .
drug - resistant hypertension thus remains a significant clinical problem in a number of patients , who could benefit from alternative treatments such as electrical activation of the carotid baroreceptors .
this review summarizes early observations on the baroreceptor system and past experiments on electrical activation of the carotid baroreceptor system .
these observations and experiments have contributed to our current understanding of the baroreceptor system in the regulation of blood pressure .
it also discusses recent experiences with a newly developed baropacing device , which is still under investigation , and the future role of carotid baroreflex activation therapy in the treatment of hypertension and other diseases .
a comprehensive search of databases ( pubmed , medline , and oldmedline ) was performed , covering the years 1950 to 2009 . the keywords carotid sinus , baroreflex , electrical activation , hypertension , and angina pectoris were used in the literature search .
articles in languages other than english , french , german , or dutch were excluded .
in 1836 , cooper   was among the first to describe the role of the baroreceptor system in the regulation of blood pressure .
more than 85  years later , hering   demonstrated in dogs that electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve induced both bradycardia and hypotension , and that transection of this nerve reversed these changes .
he was also able to show that bilateral transection of the carotid sinus nerve resulted in systemic hypertension .
similar results were reported later by korner , who observed in rabbits an increase in blood pressure ( as well as in cardiac output and heart rate ) after bilateral transection of the carotid nerves .
later on , several other investigators noted that blood pressure became very unstable after denervation of the baroreceptors . taken together
, their data suggested that the primary function of the baroreceptor system is to stabilize blood pressure and to prevent large , short - term pressure fluctuations .
accordingly , cowley , liard , and guyton   proposed that the baroreflex system is not important for the long - term regulation of blood pressure and that previous data on the development of hypertension after carotid sinus nerve denervation in animals had been highly exaggerated , presumably as a result of methodologic errors .
nonetheless , interest in the role of the baroreceptor system in hypertension has continued , and various methods have been developed to challenge the system .
these methods include blocking the carotid sinus area using procaine or lidocaine and stimulating it using epinephrine .
other researchers have stimulated the carotid sinus area using the neck cuff technique . with this device , it is possible to create a negative pressure around the neck , resulting in increased transmural pressure in the carotid arteries .
such stimulation of the baroreceptor elicits significant decreases in blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects .
kubicek and colleagues   wondered why the baroreceptor system fails to restore blood pressure to normal levels in hypertensive patients . using chronic splanchnic nerve stimulation , they discovered the mechanism of resetting of the baroreceptor system .
their data indicated that it is possible for the baroreceptors and/or the central nervous system pathways to adapt to chronically elevated arterial blood pressure .
subsequently , electroneurographic studies showed fewer impulses along the carotid sinus nerve in dogs with renal hypertension than in normotensive dogs .
these results implied that once the reflex was reset , the baroreceptor system would act to maintain the blood pressure at the elevated level .
bristow and colleagues   showed that the baroreceptor system in patients with hypertension not only is reset , but also is less sensitive .
they assessed baroreceptor sensitivity based on the relationship between changes in systolic blood pressure and changes in r - r intervals after intravenous bolus injections of angiotensin ii .
subsequently , several research groups confirmed that the baroreceptor system is less sensitive under conditions of elevated pressure .
angell - james and george   concluded that , at least in rabbits , the reduction in baroreceptor sensitivity is related more closely to the duration of hypertension than to its severity . all these data support the notion that the baroreflex system more or less passively follows the development of hypertension and that activation of the system is unlikely to produce sustained reductions in blood pressure .
despite the foregoing , there has been ongoing interest in devices to stimulate the baroreceptor system .
pioneering work was done by bilgutay and lillehei , who designed a compact , implantable device with two flat , discoid , stainless steel electrodes that were attached directly to the baroreceptor area and sutured in the wall of the carotid arteries .
the unit was triggered intermittently by r waves picked up from the heart by an electrode .
these investigators reported on the results of their experiments in four groups of dogs : normotensive , acute neurogenic hypertensive , renal hypertensive , and arteriosclerotic .
bilateral electrical stimulation of the baroreceptor for 2  h caused a drop in blood pressure in all dogs , but the best results were seen in the hypertensive dogs , with decreases ranging from 28 to 100  mm hg systolic and from 12 to 75  mm hg diastolic .
griffith and schwartz   also designed an implantable device with a bipolar electrode that was attached directly to the carotid sinus nerve .
they showed that unilateral electrical stimulation in normotensive and renal hypertensive dogs ( with or without sectioning of the contralateral carotid sinus nerve ) reduced blood pressure in all animals .
a few years later , neistadt and schwartz   reported similar results in 14 adult dogs with experimentally induced hypertension .
they applied an implantable carotid sinus nerve stimulator with two electrodes and an external rechargeable transmitter . on the day of implantation , a 36% decrease of mean arterial pressure was measured . during the first month , three dogs died and five extracted their stimulator , so only six dogs were evaluated at 1  month .
after 2  months , three dogs could be evaluated ; at that time , the average decrease in pressure was 23% . in 1969 ,
agishi and colleagues   reported on their experiments with carotid sinus nerve stimulation in mongrel dogs .
other researchers have also shown a reduction in blood pressure in animals subjected to carotid sinus nerve stimulation . from these experiments
, one can conclude that stimulation of the carotid baroreceptor or carotid sinus nerve can , indeed , lower blood pressure , at least in experimental animals .
carlsten and colleagues   were the first to report on the effects of brief episodes of direct carotid sinus stimulation in humans .
they studied five patients with neck cancer , in whom the cancer process made a dissection of the carotid sinus region necessary .
. electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve caused a typical response , with a prompt fall in mean blood pressure , pulse amplitude , and heart rate . in 1966 , bilgutay and lillehei   reported on the results of the first two patients who were treated with an electronic implantable device for up to 12  months .
these patients experienced an immediate and significant reduction in blood pressure of 70/35 and 100/40  mm hg . in the first patient , blood pressure remained at the lower level , but in the second patient , the pressure tended to return towards baseline levels . at about the same time , schwartz and colleagues   published their results on chronic electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve in 11 humans .
eight patients , who had been subjected to carotid sinus nerve stimulation for periods varying between 5  months and 2 years , were treated successfully , with a sustained reduction in blood pressure of 30 to 100  mm hg systolic and 24 to 80  mm hg diastolic .
two patients responded only minimally and one died of renal failure 2  months postoperatively .
since these initial observations , several investigators have applied electrical activation of the baroreceptor system in patients with resistant hypertension and those with severe angina pectoris .
altogether , 64 cases of chronic electrical activation of the baroreceptor system in the treatment of hypertension have been reported ( table  1 ) [ 1435 ] . in 44 of these
, significant reductions in blood pressure were shown , ranging from 15 to 130  mm hg systolic and from 10 to 80  mm hg diastolic , with follow - up periods ranging from 1 to 37  months . in one study with three patients ,
of these 44 responsive patients , 8 no longer received any antihypertensive drugs [ 15 , 28 ] .
two other patients had a minimal response   and two patients had no response at all .
most of the remaining 16 patients had a favorable response initially , but they died , stopped treatment , or were lost to follow - up within 3  months after implantation : two died because of stroke , three because of renal failure , two because of pulmonary embolism , and one because of hyperkalemia and ventricular arrhythmia [ 14 , 15 , 2729 , 35 ] . for two patients ,
three patients stopped treatment because of serious side effects , one patient required removal of the stimulator , and two patients were lost to follow - up [ 15 , 29 , 32 ] .

early publications on electrical activation of the carotid baroreceptor system in treating hypertension in 1967 , braunwald and colleagues   first reported the relief of angina pectoris by electrical activation of the baroreceptor system in humans . because the oxygen requirements of the heart are directly related to heart rate , the inotropic state of the myocardium , and intraventricular pressure
, these authors felt that if these factors could be reduced , the oxygen demands of the heart would also be diminished , resulting in a decrease in the incapacitating symptoms of angina . in total , 135 cases of chronic electrical stimulation in the treatment of angina pectoris have been reported in the literature , with significant relief of pain shown in 114 patients , with follow - up periods ranging from 1 to 132  months .
fourteen patients died ; for nine of these , the cause of death ( eg , bradycardia , ventricular fibrillation , heart failure , myocardial infarction , or pulmonary infarction ) was related to the procedure . despite the initial positive and promising results , electrical activation of the baroreceptor system has remained restricted to a carefully selected group of patients in only a few institutions .
developments in this area probably were hampered by the simultaneous introduction of more effective and better tolerated antihypertensive drugs , but several questions also remain unanswered and several problems are unresolved .
one of these is where the electrodes should be placed . in most of the humans treated , the electrodes were placed on the carotid sinus nerves , even though experiments in animals with placement of the electrodes on the carotid baroreceptors also showed good results .
no advantages or disadvantages for a certain position of the electrodes were mentioned in the literature , but a nerve seems more fragile than an artery , and risks for trauma and devascularization are greater with dissection of the nerve than with dissection of the artery .
limitations of surgical techniques at that time were another problem ; better techniques were necessary to limit the risks and shorten the duration of the implant procedure .
parsonnet and colleagues   showed similar effects on blood pressure with bilateral nerve stimulation or unilateral stimulation of the most responsive nerve .
in contrast , schwartz and colleagues   demonstrated that bilateral stimulation was more effective than the summation of the pressure reduction resulting from unilateral stimulation of the two nerves .
it is difficult to determine the most responsive nerve preoperatively , and differences in responsiveness could also occur as a result of surgical trauma .
, the duration , frequency , and amplitude of impulses must be fixed after testing to find out the optimal adjustments .
possible changes in the sensitivity of the baroreceptors or the effect of the stimulation are not taken into consideration because there is no feedback of the actual cardiovascular status to the stimulator . from this point of view
, the introduction of a feedback loop can improve the possibilities of electrical activation of the baroreceptor system .
in experimental studies , where closed - loop stimulation has been compared with open - loop stimulation , all patients achieved similar hemodynamic results , but a lower intensity of stimulation was required in the closed - loop stimulation system .
much uncertainty remains regarding damage and degeneration of the sinus nerve fibers , along with nerve fatigue and resetting of the baroreceptor mechanism after a long period of electrical stimulation .
in addition , little is known about long - term effects on the function of the heart and other organs .
proper investigation of chronic stimulation is important to evaluate the long - term effects of baroreceptor system stimulation . besides these problems
the most obvious effect is the occurrence of pain in the mandible , teeth , external auditory canals , throat , and chest , as well as in the postauricular , posterior neck , and suboccipital regions [ 12 , 15 , 2830 , 40 ] . also , adverse effects as dysphonia , dysphagia , hyperpnea , tachypnea , laryngospasm , gagging , coughing , edema around the electrodes , and hypotension have been reported [ 15 , 22 , 29 , 41 , 42 ] .
these effects were caused by nonoptimal settings of the stimulator , leakage or spread of the electrical signal from the electrodes , and improper positioning of the electrodes .
it also can lead to stimulation of muscle fibers or motor nerves , with subsequent contraction of adjacent muscles [ 12 , 40 ] .
despite the foregoing , there has been ongoing interest in devices to stimulate the baroreceptor system .

it also can lead to stimulation of muscle fibers or motor nerves , with subsequent contraction of adjacent muscles [ 12 , 40 ] .
recently , the sympathetic nervous system has moved toward the center of cardiovascular medicine , because it seems to be a key factor in the genesis of essential hypertension .
more and more research strongly suggests that the baroreceptors play a role in the long - term control of arterial pressure . as a result , interest is growing in antihypertensive therapies with beneficial effects on hypertension - related sympathetic activation [ 46 , 47 ] . in 2004 , lohmeier et al .   published the results of a study of prolonged activation of the baroreflex .
he showed sustained hypotension in six dogs that were subjected to continuous carotid baroreceptor stimulation for 7  days . with these results and
today s improved surgical techniques and microelectronics , it is time to reevaluate the possible role of electrical carotid baroreflex activation in treating patients with resistant hypertension .
detailed descriptions of this device and the surgical technique used have been previously published [ 49 , 50 ] . in general , the rheos system uses bilateral carotid artery stimulation with an open - loop system . the device is totally implantable , consisting of a pulse generator and two leads .
it uses modern microelectronics and a special lead design for chronic electrical activation of the carotid sinus baroreflex to reduce blood pressure .
the two leads conduct the activation energy from the pulse generator to the baroreceptors located on the left and right carotid arteries .
a programmer system can interact with the pulse generator , making it possible to noninvasively control the delivery of the activation energy .
the device has independent output circuits for the left and right leads , and four independent therapies can be programmed , to optimize the performance .
each therapy has independent control of start and stop times , ramp function , dose settings , burst settings , pulse amplitude , pulse width , pulse frequency , and therapy pathway . in 2003
, 11 normotensive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were enrolled in the baroreflex activation system study ( brass ) [ 51 ] .
the carotid sinus baroreceptors were briefly stimulated under local or general anesthesia through 1-minute incremental intervals .
this study demonstrated an average decrease in systolic blood pressure from 144  mm hg to 131  mm hg , directly related to the intensity of stimulation .
a case report recently described a patient with malignant hypertension who was successfully treated with the chronic implantable rheos system [ 52 ] .
now , results from a multicenter feasibility study are available ; participants with treatment - resistant hypertension underwent implantation of the rheos system .
this study shows an acceptable safety profile and a clinically and statistically significant reduction in office blood pressure of over 20  mm hg systolic after 3  months of stimulation in 37 participants .
a cohort of 17 participants was observed for up to 2  years and it was found that the blood pressure reduction could be sustained .
this new device may stimulate further research into the applicability of electrical activation of the carotid baroreflex , not only for treatment - resistant hypertension but also for related cardiovascular disorders .
apart from technical issues , these relate to the optimal use of the system . for instance
currently , frequency and voltage are set empirically , but there may be more dynamic ways to stimulate the baroreceptor system .
we need to find out how we can best modify the settings in relation to the circadian pattern of blood pressure and heart rate . also , it is unknown whether both carotids must be paced or whether unilateral stimulation will be effective . beyond determining the preferred settings , another challenge is creating a closed - loop feedback system
. a device that can monitor blood pressure and stimulate the baroreceptor system as needed would be a major breakthrough for patients with hitherto refractory hypertension .","Introduction

"developmental dysplasia of the hip ( ddh ) denotes a wide spectrum of pathologic conditions , ranging from subtle acetabular dysplasia to irreducible hip dislocation.1 it is a very common to suspect and diagnose hip dysplasia when the children start walking in india due to lack of screening programme .
the principles of treatment of dislocated hip joint for an older child are quite different from those of a new born.2 in a child of walking age and beyond , achieving a concentrically reduced hip while minimizing complications is more challenging . in the older child
the reduction of hip is difficult because of adaptive shortening of the extraarticular soft tissues , acetabular dysplasia , capsular constriction , increased femoral anteversion , fibrofatty tissue in the acetabulum , hypertrophied ligamentum teres , and fixed inversion of limbus .
if left untreated , these dysplastic changes lead to osteoarthritis in early adulthood.34 bracing , traction , closed reduction , open reduction , and femoral or pelvic osteotomies are the frequently used treatment modalities for older children.57 the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head has been reduced by avoiding immobilization of the hip in extreme abduction and by using femur - shortening osteotomies when appropriate.8 pelvic osteotomy continues to gain favor for the treatment of selected patients over 18 months of age.910 traction has been used before reduction of a dislocated hip to decrease the risk of ischemia of the femoral head , but data supporting use of this treatment are inconsistent.1113 closed or open reduction without a bony realignment procedure is associated with residual dysplasia.1415 femoral shortening has been shown to facilitate reduction and does not appear to increase the prevalence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.1617 many authors have reported success with a single - stage procedure consisting of open reduction , capsulorrhaphy , femoral shortening , and pelvic osteotomy.1823 the one - stage surgical treatment for ddh , consisting of open reduction , femoral shortening , and pelvic osteotomy , is a demanding procedure , technically , than a staged procedure .
we report retrospective analysis to evaluate the radiographic and functional results of one - stage triple operative procedure of open reduction , femoral shortening , and salter 's osteotomy in older children .
between january 2005 and june 2010 , 25 patients ( 30 hips ) underwent one - stage triple procedure of open reduction , femoral shortening derotation , and salter 's osteotomy for the treatment of ddh .
the average age was 3.9 years ( range 18 months  8 yrs ) at the time of open reduction . only the patients with idiopathic congenital dislocation of the hip were included in the study .
clinical data regarding pain symptoms , gait pattern , range of hip joint motion and presence of trendelenburg sign were recorded for each patient preoperatively and on the latest followup using the modified mckay 's criteria.24 tnnis classification system was used to assess the degree of dislocation of the femoral head.25 radiographic evaluations included examination of preoperative and followup plain radiographs to classify patients according to the severin 's grading system.26 avascular necrosis was assessed using bucholz and ogden 's classification.2728 open reduction followed the recommendations of salter29 for the innominate osteotomy surgical technique and the femoral osteotomy was similar to that described by predrag klisic.30 the operative procedure started with the modified smith - petersen anterior approach ( bikini incision ) [ figure 1a ] .
the muscles were reflected from the inner and outer aspects of the iliac crest and the hip joint was exposed [ figure 1b ] .
this was followed by the release of iliopsoas , excision of pulvinar , release of ligamentum teres , and incision of transverse acetabular ligament .
gentle traction was applied to the extremity to assess the degree of contracture of the muscles that crossed the hip joint .
due to the soft tissue contractures , the femoral head still was not reducible without applying excessive pressure .
peroperative photographs showing ( a ) bikini incision ; ( b ) exposure of the hip joint ; ( c ) femoral osteotomy fixed with 4-hole small fragment plate ; ( d ) pelvic osteotomy performed by using a gigli saw ; ( e ) bone graft taken from the proximal fragment of the ilium ; ( f ) pelvic osteotomy fixed with a triangular bone graft and two k - wires ; ( g ) reduction of the hip joint through a separate lateral approach , the proximal end of femur was exposed subperiosteally and a transverse osteotomy was made at the level of lesser trochanter .
the amount of overlap in the femur was evaluated to determine the amount of femoral shaft to be resected .
the osteotomy site was internally fixed with a four - hole small fragment plate [ figure 1c ] .
shortening of 12 cm was found to be necessary to allow easy reduction of the femoral head while maintaining normal soft tissue tension across the hip . at the time of open reduction
femoral anteversion in excess of 60 as determined by forward angulation of the head and neck of femur with relation to the coronal plane of the femur is considered an indication for derotational osteotomy .
derotation was achieved by externally rotating the distal femoral fragment in relation to the proximal fragment until the patella pointed directly forward before applying the plate .
it is important to avoid excessive derotation of femur as posterior instability may result if it is combined with salter 's innominate osteotomy . at the time of initial reduction , if coverage of the femoral head was poor ( which was assessed by the evidence of inadequate coverage of femoral head anteriorly with hip in extension and laterally with hip in adduction ) or if the acetabulum was clearly maldirected , then we proceed for salter 's osteotomy . in this study
all 25 patients ( 30 hips ) required salter 's osteotomy for stabilization of the hip joint .
a pelvic osteotomy was performed as described by salter using a gigli saw [ figure 1d ] .
a full - thickness bone graft was removed from the anterior part of the iliac crest and trimmed to the shape of a wedge ; the base should correspond approximately to the distance between the anterior superior and inferior spines .
after osteotomy , the distal segment of the innominate bone containing the entire acetabulum was shifted forward , downward , and outward so that the osteotomy site was opened anterolaterally .
the bone graft was inserted on its edge into the osteotomy site and held with two k - wires [ figure 1e , f ] .
the hip was reduced concentrically , and the stability was assessed with the limb in the weight - bearing position , i.e. in slight abduction and extension [ figure 1 g ] .
redundant capsule was excised when necessary and capsulorrhaphy performed with interrupted absorbable sutures . throughout the operation ,
the mean blood loss which is measured by weighing sponges and recording suction volumes is 220 ml ( range 200- 250 ml ) .
the average time for the combined operation of open reduction and osteotomy was 2.5 hours ( range 2.25 - 2.75 hours ) .
postoperatively , the hips were immobilized in a 1 hip spica in position of slight flexion , abduction and internal rotation for 6 weeks .
this was changed to an abduction splint for a further 4 weeks which allows non weight bearing flexion and extension mobilization of the hip joints .
k - wires were removed after consolidation at the osteotomy site usually at 68 weeks .
partial weight bearing started after 10 weeks with crutches for 2 weeks , followed by full weight bearing .
patients with bilateral dysplasia ( n=5 ) had the procedures on both hips at an interval of 36 months ( mean 4.5 months ) as per patient 's convenience .
the patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic at 3 month intervals during the first 2 years after surgery and then at yearly intervals .
they were evaluated clinically during each visit for the range of motion of the affected hip , the quality of gait , and the presence of any pain .
each patient 's preoperative and postoperative radiographs were evaluated to determine the degree of displacement of the femoral head ( the tnnis grade ) , the acetabular index , c  e angle , the continuity of the shenton 's line , and the presence or absence of avascular necrosis .
all the patients with a minimum follow up of two years were included in this study .

there were 20 unilateral dislocations ( 9 right unilateral dislocations , 11 left unilateral dislocations ) and 5 bilateral dislocations .
the average age at the time of operation was 3.9 years ( range 1.68 years ) .
immediate postoperative shortening of lower limb was 12 cm ( average 1.5 cm ) which improved to 0.21 cm ( average 0.3 cm ) during the latest followup examination .
femur derotated to an average of 23.2 ( range 2030 ) to correct the anteversion that was noted during the operation .
surgical and followup data on the final clinical evaluation , the clinical results according to mckay 's scoring system [ table 2 ] were also favorable
. at preoperative evaluation , 23 hips ( 76.6% ) were in fair condition and 7 hips ( 23.3% ) were in poor condition . at the end of the study
, there were 13 hips ( 43.3% ) in excellent condition , 14 ( 46.6% ) in good condition , 2 ( 6.6% ) in fair condition , and 1(3.3% ) in poor condition .
mckay 's criteria for clinical evaluation according to severin 's classification [ table 3 ] fourteen ( 46.6% ) hips were severin 's class v and 16 ( 53.3% ) were severin 's class iv prior to surgery .
postoperatively , 25 hips ( 83.3% ) were rated class i ( 19 hips ) and class ii ( 6 hips ) .
five hips ( 16.6% ) were rated class iii ( 4 hips ) and class vi ( one hip ) at the latest followup .
cases 17 and 20 are illustrative of excellent clinical and radiographic ( class i ) results [ figures 2a  c and 3a , b ] . cases 7 , 13 , and 16 showed good clinical and radiographic ( class ii ) results [ figures 4a  c , 5a  c , and 6a  c ] .

tnnis classification for severity of dislocation the acetabular index was measured at each followup radiographs to assess acetabular development at the final followup .
the average acetabular index was 234.1 ; it decreased from 425 preoperatively to 212 postoperatively .
one patient ( case 5 ) developed lateral physeal damage ( type ii classification of bucholz and ogden ) . at the latest followup ,
the clinical results were good , although the radiographic results were severin 's class iii .
the hip was considered to be adequately reduced when the radiographs showed an intact shenton 's line , a center - edge angle of more then 15 , and an acetabular index of less then 28. the adequacy of acetabular remodeling was evaluated by comparing the immediate postoperative radiograph with the latest followup radiograph .
improvement of the acetabular index by at least 8 and to 20 or less in the most recent radiographs was considered to be adequate correction .
evaluation of gait revealed that three hips ( cases 9 , 18 , and 21 ) had a mild gluteus medius lurch and two ( cases 5 and 15 ) had a short legged gait .
one patient had infrequent discomfort , and three noted weakness ( a mild trendelenburg limp ) .
in general , the subjective evaluation did not correlate with the objective findings ; it was therefore of little value in assessing the end results .
one patient ( case 21 ) had an open reduction and innominate osteotomy performed in a false acetabulum .
most recent followup shows severin 's radiographic rating class vi [ figure 7a  c ] .
repeat arthrotomy at the time of plate removal disclosed extensive scarring but no other intraarticular obstruction or pathology .

failure to treat at an early age may lead to gait abnormalities , limitation of motion of the hip , joint pain , and osteoarthritis .
however , the age beyond which surgical treatment is contraindicated has been the subject of debate due to the risk of serious complications . concentric reduction in older children may be a challenge , more so when the femoral head is flattened or when the acetabulum is dysplastic
. reduction may be hindered by soft tissue contracture with undue pressure on the femoral head .
this may result in poor development of hip joint and avascular necrosis of the femoral head .
femoral osteotomy , including shortening , derotation osteotomy , combined with open reduction , capsulorrhaphy , and pelvic osteotomy , is an extensive procedure that can safely be undertaken in one stage .
this one stage procedure which has been used in older children is the method of choice in the treatment of late diagnosed congenital dislocation of the hip . with femoral shortening as the fundamental step
, this method can be applied in high dislocations to prevent undue pressure on the femoral head , which is the main cause of avascular necrosis , joint stiffness , and failures .
there have been numerous reports discussing the merits of a more aggressive surgical approach that includes a single procedure combining an open reduction with a femoral or pelvic osteotomy .
salter and dubos showed 93.6% good to excellent results in children of younger age group.31 klisic and jankovic ( n=60 ) reported 63% excellent to good results in the age group of 515 years.30 karaka et al .
operated on 47 patients ( 55 hips ) , who were 4 years and more , with 67% good or excellent clinical results and 65% good or excellent radiological results.32 ryan et al .
operated on 15 patients ( 18 hips ) , who were 4 years and more , with 100% good or excellent clinical results ( mckay 's criteria ) and 100% severin 's classification class i ( 10 ) and ii ( 8).34 umer et al .
have reported 86.2% good to excellent clinical results and 51.7% severin 's class i at final evaluation.35 the results of the salter 's osteotomy for treatment of ddh in 30 hips treated beyond 18 months of age were reviewed .
the results of the study showed a significant improvement in the radiological features of the operated hip joints according to severin 's classification . at the followup none of the patient had class v severity compared to 14 hips ( 46.6% ) prior to surgery .
there was only one hip in class iv post operatively as compared to 16 hips ( 53.3% ) preoperatively .
notably 83.3% of hips achieved an improvement of class i ( 19 hips ) and class ii ( 6 hips ) at followup compared to none before surgery .
similarly , favorable results were also observed when clinical parameters were compared before and after surgery . at final followup , excellent to good results
only 1 ( 3.3% ) hip joint demonstrated poor condition at followup compared to 7 ( 23.3% ) prior to surgery
. principle of preserving the shape and capacity of the acetabulum by salter 's innominate osteotomy is important for the future function and development of the joint as compared to pemberton osteotomy which alters the shape of acetabulum and decreases its capacity .
late - diagnosed congenital dislocation of the hip with one - stage open reduction , femoral shortening , capsulorrhaphy , and pelvic osteotomy corrects associated femoral and acetabular deformities .
this operation improves the cover of the femoral head and provide stability in the weight - bearing position .
this procedure can be done safely , with reliable results and without an increase in the risk of avascular necrosis .
the limitation of this study is that all the patients were not followed to skeletal maturity .
the presence of residual hip dysplasia and problems relating to subluxation , trochanteric overgrowth and avascular necrosis if any should be recognized early and treated appropriately to ensure optimum results .","I

"there are few modern series of diabetic neuropathy confirmed by nerve tissue obtained at biopsy or postmortem examination available to allow clinicopathological correlation of the different neuropathic syndromes .   in 1996 ,
younger et al .   reported clinicopathological and immunohistochemical findings in 20 patients with heterogeneous forms of diabetic neuropathy .  
the present report continues that series to a total of 107 patients who underwent detailed clinicopathological assessment .
one hundred seven consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy comprising distal symmetrical polyneuropathy ( dspn ) , proximal diabetic neuropathy ( pdn ) hereafter referred to as diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy ( dlrpn ) [ 2 , 3 ] , and mononeuritis multiplex ( mnm ) at the new york presbyterian hospital and new york university langone medical center were identified from 1992 to 2002 .  
peripheral neuropathy was established by standard nerve conduction studies ( ncss ) and needle electromyography ( emg ) .                  
patients with dspn presented with distal leg sensory and later motor involvement manifested variably by pain , paresthesia , limb weakness , gait disturbance , imbalance , and hyporeflexia in the legs .   patients with dlrpn
presented with pelvi - femoral pain followed by weakness beginning focally and unilaterally , affecting the leg and thigh , progressing to involve the lower leg with spread to the contralateral limb , combined with sensory loss and concomitant weight loss often in excess of 10 pounds .  
mnm presented with a stepwise pattern of motor and sensory loss in the distribution of individual peripheral nerves .   
patients were referred for peripheral nerve biopsy after diagnosis of symptomatic peripheral neuropathy to ascertain the histopathological basis of neuropathy , not based on specific clinical or electrophysiological features and performed along the sural nerve above the ankle according to standard technique [ 1 , 4 ] after obtaining informed consent .
the sural nerve was chosen for biopsy because it is the most widely studied nerve histopathologically . in all but one patient with mnm ,
the status of control of diabetes mellitus at the time of nerve biopsy was comparable for all patients .  
the neuropathology was classified as primarily axonopathy and myelinopathy after analysis of semithin epoxy sections and teased nerve fiber preparations .
the   severity was categorized as mild , moderate , or severe based upon the degree of myelinated fiber degeneration and loss in transverse paraffin and epoxy sections .  
mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration in or around epineurial vessel walls , respectively , defined micovasculitis ( mv ) and perivasculitis ( pv ) .  
necrotizing arteritis ( na ) was diagnosed by active or healed lesions in arteriae nervorum .  
the frequency of mv , pv , and na was not subcategorized according to the clinical presentation of neuropathy .
two patients had juvenile - onset diabetes mellitus , and the remainder had types 1 and 2 in equal ratio .
one patient had mnm , and the remainder had dspn and dlrpn in a 2  :  1 ratio .  
five patients ( 4% ) had minor wound infection at the incision site that responded to antibiotics and 5 ( 4% ) had short - lasting postoperative causalgia .  
the severity of neuropathy was mild in 17% , moderate in 50% , and severe in 33% .  
two - thirds of nerves were deemed primary axonopathy , and one - third primary myelinopathy .   altogether , 3% and 23% of nerves , respectively , revealed mv ( figure 1 ) and pv .  
immunofluorescence showed c3 and c5b-9 membrane attack complex deposits in the walls of endoneurial microvessels in two - thirds of nerves .  
necrotizing arteritis ( figure 2 ) , detected in nerve biopsy tissue of two patients with dspn and one dlrpn , was absent in postmortem tissue of the latter case in which femoral , sciatic nerve , and lumbar plexus   showed pv of the epineurium , perineurium , and endoneurium .
the frequency of mv ( 3% ) and pv ( 23% ) was reduced compared to 60% and 40% , respectively , when immunoperoxidase immunoflourescent staining was employed .  
the 3% frequency of mv in our cohort compared favorably with 6% reported in dlrpn .  
mononuclear cell infiltration was first noted in the peripheral nerves of patients with diabetes mellitus obtained at postmortem and in amputated limbs .  
later , pv [ 2 , 8 ] , mv [ 2 , 9 ] , and na [ 2 , 10 ] were noted in sural [ 2 , 8 ] , superficial peroneal sensory [ 2 , 9 ] , and femoral intermedius nerve biopsies [ 9 , 10 ] .   the infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells proved to be activated cd8 + t cells expressing pathogenic cytokines and major histocompatibility class ii antigen , in association with activated complement .    
it was not possible to correlate the frequency and severity of peripheral nerve inflammation with the clinical forms of diabetic neuropathy in the present cohort since the nerves demonstrating mv and na were very few in number , and those   showing pv were not further stratified into subgroups of severity .  
further , the present study did not ultrastructurally examine diabetic endoneurial microvessels that have previously shown reduplication of basement membranes and pericyte degeneration , which can lead to alterations in the size or the vessel lumen , thickening of vessel walls , alterations in the blood - nerve barrier , and endoneurial microenvironment .    
axonopathy was the predominant pathology overall in the present cohort , however a third of nerves demonstrated demyelination .   
the latter has historically been attributed to axonal degeneration as the primary ischemic event .  
segmental demyelination and remyelination was observed in 23% of sural nerve biopsies due to primary axonal degeneration , and in 12/33 sural nerves in dlrpn , with vascular inflammatory cell collections .  
anecdotal reports of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( cidp ) and diabetes mellitus   support primary autoimmune demyelinating nerve disease , however we were unable to retrospectively define cases of cidp according to strict criteria available during the study period .   
the finding of necrotizing arteritis and microvasculitis in the peripheral nerve biopsies of several patients with heterogeneous forms of diabetic neuropathy lends further support to ischemic axonopathy without invoking a concomitant systemic vasculitic process .
patchy fiber loss of upper sciatic nerve with severe length - dependent distal fiber loss and axonopathy   was noted in postmortem tissue of two diabetics with distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy and reminiscent of necrotizing angiopathic neuropathy ( nan ) .   notwithstanding
, it remains enigmatic that neither systemic nor widespread peripheral nerve vasculitis was detected in postmortem tissue from the patients with na in sural nerve biopsy , or in the postulated cases of diabetic nan ; more likely , mv and severe pv contribute more to epineurial ischemia than does na .   
although this study did not examine treatment choices made for individual patients or subgroups of the cohort based upon nerve biopsy results , the present findings of sural nerve inflammation and demyelination may be a clue to an underlying autoimmune etiopathogenesis in some affected patients .  
future studies should address the elucidation of prospective clinical and laboratory criteria to select patients for open peripheral nerve biopsy in view of the availability of epidermal nerve fiber ( enf ) studies by punch skin biops .  
the latter is less invasive and instead measures enf density and histology but does not sample large myelinated nerve fiber bundles or epineurial blood vessels which may be clue to systemic or nonsystemic peripheral nerve vasculitis .","1. Introduction

"agenesis of one or more teeth in primary or permanent dentition is known as hypodontia , while , hyperdontia is a condition that of having extra to the normal complement of teeth .
the occurrence of both these identities in the same individual is a form of combined numeric variation .
although , the existing literature shows exclusively either hyperdontia or hypodontia , however , only a few studies have been accounted the incidence of both the anomalies .
the term  concomitant hypo - hyperdontia  ( chh ) has been used to describe the occurrence in the same individual .
the aetiology of chh remains unclear and it is not evidently documented in the literature . while , environmental and genetic factors have been anticipated to explain the occurrence of these anomalies .
furthermore , chh has been reported in patients with down syndrome , dubowitz syndrome , ellis - van creveld syndrome , fucosidosis , g / bbb syndrome , marfan syndrome and cleft lip and palate .
the reported prevalence was between 0.002% and 3.1% , most of these were of chh involved both the arches .
most recently , it has been reported by several authors the combination of both hypodontia and hyperdontia in both arches .
the occurrence of chh in the same dental arch in a healthy patient is most likely to be a rare phenomenon and all existing reports are reported in the maxilla .
the occurrence of chh in the mandibular arch is extremely rare , however , most recently few cases has been reported on this identity involving congenitally missing both central incisors .
the purpose of this article is to review the literature and to describe three rare identities of chh in the anterior region of the mandibular arch .
this was a case report of three patients ( one female and two males ) attended to the department of pedodontics and preventive dentistry as regular walk - in patients .
medical histories and family histories were unremarkable and all patients were full term babies born to parents of a non - consanguineous marriage .
there was no history of infection , metabolic disorders and trauma , in their childhood .
all our patients were attended 1 time to our dental clinic for examination , among these one patient ( female ) received restorations by a private dentist .
oral hygiene was adequate , absence of the mandibular central incisor tooth 41 and presence of a microdontic tooth in the midline was evident which was conical in shape [ figure 1(case 1 ) and figure 2 ( case 2 ) ] .
on radiographic examination , the panoramic radiographs revealed that the conical shaped tooth was with complete root formation and no periapical changes were evident [ figures 35 ] .
based on its appearance and size it was diagnosed as supernumerary tooth ( snt ) .
the approximation of the roots of the snt and incisors , no spacing was present in between the incisors which highlighted the absence of the incisor in all three cases .
both clinical and radiographic examinations revealed that the absence of tooth 41and the presence of a snt in the tooth 41 region .
the diagnosis of mandibular chh was made in three case based on the history , clinical and radiological investigations .
all the patient parents were informed and options were given for the management of conical shape snt .
the options that were considered were composite restoration , single unit crown and resin - bonded bridge on the short - term basis and implants followed by extraction on long - term .
the patients underwent a complete physical examination to evaluate the syndromic features that were not identified .
esthetics were given priority and the patients were advised rehabilitation for the anterior teeth spacing ; however , two ( case 2 and 3 ) of patients refused any intervention and was satisfied with their current dentition .
one patient ( case 1 ) gone through scaling and restorations for the mandibular first permanent molars and he has been kept under review .
occlusal view of the mandible showing supernumerary tooth in tooth 41 region ( case 1 ) occlusal view of the mandible showing supernumerary tooth in tooth 41 region ( case 2 ) panoramic radiograph ( case 1 ) showing the congenitally missing tooth 41 , presence of mandibular mesiodens and taurodontism in first permanent molars at 8.5 years panoramic radiograph ( case 2 ) showing congenitally missing tooth 41 and presence of mandibular mesiodens at 10.9 years panoramic radiograph ( case 3 ) showing congenitally missing tooth 41 , presence of mandibular mesiodens and taurodontism in first permanent molars at 9.2 years
gibson divided hypo - hyperdontia as pre - maxillary , maxillary , mandibular and bi - maxillary hypo - hyperdontia based on the site of occurrence .
the three cases described in this article are good examples of mandibular chh excluding the third molars in both the arches .
have discussed the association of third molar agenesis with missing teeth from other classes of teeth .
the authors concluded that the association among the reduction in the number of other teeth and third molars hysterics the hypothesis of a field of variable intensity , which , in its greatest degree of expression , eliminates all four third molar teeth .
the distribution of missing third molars in the present report was teeth 18 and 28 ( case 1 ) , 18 , 28 and 48 ( case 2 ) and tooth 18 ( case 3 ) accordingly , if , third molars were taken in to account these cases were considered as bi - maxillary chh . several hypothesis , including atavism , dichotomy , hyperactivity of the dental lamina and the concept of multi - factorial inheritance , have been proposed to elucidate the formation of snt that are common in males . similarly , several theories have been propagated on the tooth agenesis ; the conception of a polygenic multi - factorial model of etiology still provides a good explanation for hypodontia , which is common in females .
additionally , there is no family history in three cases was evident , it has been recommended that disturbances in differentiation , migration and proliferation of neural crest cells was associated with interactions between the epithelial and the mesenchymal cells during the initiation of odontogenesis may be responsible for chh .
a recent study from poland reported that chh is rare and sex - related , with a predominance of hypodontia .
snt may be single or multiple , unilateral or bilateral in distribution , can occur in both dental arches and either in the primary mixed or permanent dentitions .
the mesiodens in maxillary arch are the most commonly occurring snt type followed by mandibular supplemental premolars .
contrarily , the cases in the report exhibited snt in the anterior region of the mandible .
occurrence of snt in the mandibular anterior region is exceedingly rare condition , but when they do occur , they appear as one or more smaller cone - shaped teeth . excluding
third molars mandibular second premolars were the most commonly missing in caucasian population , whereas , mandibular incisors in asian populations .
it has also been reported that the unilateral form of missing teeth were more common .
reported that the occurrence of chh in both jaws or in the maxilla and the authors stated that chh never occur only in the mandible .
nevertheless , this condition in mandibular anterior region has been reported [ table 1 ] , where both mandibular central incisors were missing with the presence of snt in the midline .
in contrast , in present cases only one mandibular central incisor was missing with the presence of a snt .
therefore , it is surprising to note that occurrence of agenesis of unilateral central incisor exhibited in all cases with the presence of snt .
this concurs with the reported findings that a snt seldom approaches or equals normal tooth size and shape , microdontic and conical shaped mandibular incisors are extremely rare .
details of the three cases presented with mandibular hypo - hyperdontia along with published cases taurodontism has been frequently reported with the incidence rate of 0.25% and 18% .
seow and lai reported 34.8% of patients affected by hypodontia had taurodontism while gomes et al .
it has been reported that taurodontism has been associated with chh ; similarly , in the present report two of our patients with chh exhibited taurodontism in maxillary first permanent molars .
furthermore , most recently densevaginatus and double tooth have been reported in association with chh .
the standard treatment protocols have not been discussed for the management of chh in literature and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary ; hence , the management of chh is quite challenging . in the present scenario ,
no treatment , extraction of mesiodens and close the space with fixed orthodontics , extraction of mesiodens and maryland bridge as short - term and implants in feature and composite build - up to mimic as incisor , were treatment options included . among our patients
early diagnosis is a key for the successful management , since it permits the dentist to implement the most appropriative treatment options for the patient to minimize consequences .
the diagnosis of chh in all our cases was only an incidental finding , which is similar to most of the findings that have been reported .
moreover , it has been stated that a high proportion of patients with chh may remain undiagnosed in the population .
the cases in the present report created a dilemma for the first instance in a clinical scenario and it is very difficult to diagnosis the chh in a growing child .
our three cases exhibited mesiodens in tooth 41 region , which was coincidental and the size and shape of the tooth in 41 regions was completely different than usual appearance of mandibular central incisor .
clinical examination along with radiographic evaluation drew the proper diagnosis of the dilemma in our cases .
it has also been sugested that the use of radiograph along with the clinical examination may enhance the recognition of chh which probably could modify in the treatment plan .
chh is an unusual condition and occurrence in the mandibular arch is extremely rare . moreover ,
agenesis of unilateral mandibular incisor , with the presence of snt in the anterior region of the mandible is extremely rare .
the present cases are unique cases of mandibular chh . furthermore , taurodontism associations with chh have been evident , which needed further discussion .","INTRODUCTION

"simple bone cysts ( sbcs ) are benign bone tumors that traditionally present in the first 2 decades of life .
the cysts have a predilection to occur in males more frequently than in females ( 3:1 ) .
the most common site of sbcs is the humerus ( 59% ) , followed by the femur ( 25% ) and the calcaneus ( 6% ) .
alternative therapeutic options for sbcs have included steroid injections , autologous bone marrow injection , open curettage and bone grafting , various methods of cyst decompression , the use of calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate , and cannulated screws .
however , treatment of sbcs remains controversial because of the cure rate and the invasiveness of surgery .
although most sbcs resolve by the time the patient reaches skeletal maturity , it has been reported that patient age and the location of the cyst within the physis are predictors of successful treatment .
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the treatment of sbcs using a cannulated hydroxyapatite ( ha ) pin ( figure 1 ) that can decompress continuously and does not require further surgery for implant removal unlike cannulated screws .
cannulated hydroxyapatite pin ( outside diameter 8  mm , inside diameter 3  mm ) .
between 1989 and 2014 , ha pins ( kobayashi medical , tokyo , japan ) insertion was performed as the first operation on all cases of sbc that required surgery .
of the 43 patients that underwent ha pins insertion , 35 were males and 8 were females , with a mean age of 12.1 years ( range , 522 years ) .
the sbcs were located in the calcaneus in 23 , the humerus in 15 , the femur in 3 , and the pelvis in 2 cases ( table 1 ) . in all patients , minimal
fenestration ( diameter , 8  mm ) was performed in the cyst wall , and then curettage was done .
after that , multiple drill holes were made in the cyst wall with a k - wire to establish a connection to healthy bone marrow , followed by insertion of the ha pin .
healing period , recurrence and healing rates , and risk factors for recurrence were evaluated .
fisher exact test was performed to examine the risk factors for sbc recurrence , such as sex , age , cyst sites , and distance from the physis
statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics software , version 19 ( ibm spss , armonk , ny ) .
healing was achieved without intervention in 38 patients after a mean of 6.4 months ( range , 112 ) ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
two patients had persistent small residual cysts , which had no changes after 1 year at the latest follow - up . there were 5 patients with recurrences ( humerus 4 , femur 1 ) , which were cured by curettage and artificial bone grafting in expectation of adding mechanical strength ( figure 4 ) .
all patients with sbcs of the calcaneus were healed after a mean of 5.0 months ( range , 110 months ) .
fisher exact test , age < 10 years , site involving the humerus , and contact with the growth plate were significantly associated with sbc recurrence ( p  <  0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .
( a ) an ha pin has been inserted into the cyst cavity after curettage and drilling .
( d ) recurrence of the cyst occurred in part of the proximal artificial bone 23 months after reoperation .
( e ) sixteen months after the third operation , the cyst has completely healed .
in the present study , cannulation using an ha pin was found to be a useful technique for sbcs , particularly calcaneal cysts , because it is a minimally invasive procedure with a high cure rate .
strategies for treatment of sbcs have evolved over a long time . currently , management methods include observation , injections of steroid or bone marrow or demineralized bone matrix , decompression using a cannulated pin and screw , and combined surgical techniques .
however , management of sbcs remains controversial because of their healing rate and the invasiveness of treatment .
spontaneous healing occurs in < 10% of patients with an sbc as a result of traumatic decompression by a pathological fracture .
steroid injection was proposed by scaglietti et al in 1979 ; they reported a high healing rate after steroid injection .
however , subsequent studies reported a lower healing rate for steroid injection , only 41% to 63% .
the injection of bone marrow alone or in combination with demineralized bone matrix has been proposed to have a good healing rate of 43% to 69% . on the other hand ,
the gold standard procedure has been considered for many years to be curettage with removal of the cyst membrane and bone grafting .
decompression of sbcs can be achieved using needles or implants , such as intramedullary nails , kirchner wires , and cannulated screws or pins .
decompression using intramedullary nails provided healing rates of almost 70% , with recurrence rates of < 10% . however
they do not need to be removed and have osteoconductive properties that may stimulate healing . in the present study ,
the healing rate was 88.2% , which was satisfactory compared with the healing rate by the methods mentioned earlier .
cho et al , rougraff et al , and glanzmann and campos reported that it took 9 to 16 months to achieve remodeling . in the present study ,
age was reported to be a reliable predictor , with children > 10 years of age having a higher rate of cyst healing than those < 10 years . nonetheless , in a more recent study
however , in the present study , age < 10 years and location in the humerus were associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate .
alternatively , haidar et al reported that a lesion located < 2  cm from the growth plate may be a risk factor for recurrence . in the present study ,
a significantly higher recurrence rate was found for patients with a lesion contacting the physis . as the reason for this
, we speculate that the proximal humerus in the young , due to its rapid growth , may have a likelihood of venous obstruction leading to the formation of cysts .
the limitation of the present study is the absence of a comparative group or a randomized comparison .
moreover , the number of patients enrolled was relatively small , and thus the statistical power of the study was weak
, the present study suggests that cannulation using ha pins for sbcs is a useful technique , particularly for calcaneal cysts , because it is a minimally invasive procedure with a high cure rate .
age < 10 years , site in the humerus , and contact with the growth plate were significant risk factors for sbc recurrence .","INTRODUCTION

"osteoarthritis ( oa ) in knee joint is the most common reason behind functional disability that leads to lowered quality of life in old age people of india .
some of the objective factors that may influence oa disease severity include but are not limited to age , height , weight , and bmi . in physiotherapy practice , lowering the pain , other symptoms , improving the activities of daily living ( adl ) , and quality of life ( qol ) are main outcome criteria for oa knee rehabilitation .
to achieve this rehabilitative goal , physiotherapists use both self - reported questionnaires as well as performance - based tests to monitor prognosis in the above said parameters , that is , pain , symptoms , adl , and qol .
self - reported questionnaires give subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias within short period of time , whereas , performance - based tests objectively measures patient 's ability of perform adl activities .
examples for self - reported questionnaire are womac , sf-36 , koos , and so forth .
examples for physical performance tests are timed up and go test ( tug ) , six - minute walk test ( 6-mwt ) , stair climbing test , and so forth .
physical performance tests are affected by motivation and not affected by psychogenic factors such as beliefs , expectations , cognitive impairments , and cultural , lingual , and educational level [ 3 , 4 ] .
possible difference between the two may be performance - based tests measure functional limitation , whereas self - reported questionnaire reveals disability , that is , combination of social and psychological side of the functional limitation .
functional limitation is sooner detected by performance - based tests than self - reported questionnaires [ 5 , 6 ] .
there is no consensus regarding the use of tests while some prefer to use self - reported questionnaires because they are easy to administer and have high internal consistency features ; others prefer performance - based tests as they consider that these tests are essential for adl evaluation of the patient .
ideally , both self - reported and functional tests should be used in knee rehabilitation setting [ 7 , 8 ] . in order to ascertain more valid results , performance - based tests should always be correlated with self - reported measures . in previous studies , womac , sf-36 , and koos
are compared with timed up and go ( tug ) test [ 7 , 911 ]
. however there is no study that compares self - reported questionnaire with 6-mwt which is more deals with adl as this measures both walking ability as well as endurance .
koos is a relatively newer self - reported questionnaire that was developed from womac by roos et al .   for oa knee patients .
thus , primary objective of present study was to see the correlation of subjectively measured koos questionnaire with objectively measured 6-minute walk test ( 6-mwt ) , age , height , weight , and bmi .
present study was a cross - sectional survey study in which data was extracted from individuals with clinical and nonradiographic idiopathic or primary knee
acr criteria for clinical diagnosis of idiopathic knee oa were based on knee pain in either knee on most days for at least 1 month in the previous year and at least two of the following signs / symptoms : stiffness , crepitus , bony tenderness , and bony enlargement .
exclusion criteria were ( 1 ) self - reports of currently doing lower - extremity exercise 2 times per week ; ( 2 ) self - reports of currently fitness walking 90 minutes per week ; ( 3 ) being unable to read english / urdu questionnaire ( koos ) ; ( 4 ) inflammatory arthritis ; ( 5 ) self - reports of having current knee conditions such as meniscus tears and knee ligament ruptures ; ( 6 ) fracture of spine or lower extremities ; ( 7 ) being scheduled to undergo a major surgical procedure in the next 6 months ; ( 8) those with neurological conditions ; ( 9 ) having contraindications for exercise testing based on american college of sports medicine   criteria . total of 251 patients ( 117 males , 134 females ) met the above said criteria and were included for the present study .
koos is a self - reported questionnaire consisted of 42 questions in total addressing five patient - related domains including pain ( 9 questions ) , other disease - specific symptoms ( 7 questions ) , activity of daily living ( adl ) ( 17 questions ) , sport and recreation function ( 5 questions ) , and knee - related quality of life ( 4 questions ) .
the walking track was a 30  m long empty corridor with marks on every 5 meters .
patients were asked to walk back and forth along the 30  m track and to cover the longest possible distance in 6 minutes . at the end of every minute patients
two weekly test - retest reliability of walking distance was reported to be 0.87 for patients with knee oa .
patients stood on a firm surface in their bare feet to have their height measured .
body mass was measured at the end of examination with a calibrated bathroom - type digital scale , on a firm surface .
patients were weighed in the standing position , wearing light indoor clothes , but no shoes , jewellery , or heavy clothing .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated with the formula ( weight/(height ) ) .
results are given in mean , standard deviation ( sd ) , and range ( minimum  maximum ) .
correlation was done using spearman rank correlation since self - reported data was ordinal variable .
the spearman correlation coefficient was interpreted as follows : < 0.3 : none ; 0.310.5 : weak ; 0.510.7 : strong ; 0.710.9 : very strong ; and > 0.9 : excellent .

 table 2 shows mean and standard deviation along with range of all subscales of koos and 6-mwt in primary oa knee patients .
overall koos - sports and recreation had a minimum mean score followed by qol subscale .
6-mwt had a weak correlation with koos - adl ( rho 0.461 ) and strong correlation with koos - symptom , koos - pain , and koos - sports ( rho 0.578 , 0.619 , and 0.536 , resp . ) and very strong correlation with koos - qol ( rho 0.733 ) .
bmi had a strong correlation with koos - pain , koos - symptom , koos - adl , and koos - sports ( rho 0.683 , 0.641 , 0.523 , and 0.640 , resp . ) and very strong correlation with koos - qol ( rho 0.816 ) .
weight had a weak correlation with koos - symptom , koos - adl , and koos - sports ( rho 0.485 , 0.333 , and 0.413 , resp . ) and strong correlation with koos - pain and koos - qol ( rho 0.542 and 0.582 , resp . ) .
there was no correlation between age and any of koos subscales except age and koos - qol subscale ( rho 0.159 , p < 0.05 ) .
the aim of the present study was to see the correlation between koos five subscales and some of the objective measures , that is , 6-mwt , age , height , weight , and bmi .
the results show there is weak ( none ) correlation of koos subscales with height , progressively increase with weight and bmi .
mean score of koos all subscales were less than present study results but trend is similar between the two studies meaning sports and recreation subscale is the least followed by qol subscale and symptom subscale was the maximum in both studies .
the present study results are in agreement with sabirli et al .   who reported strong correlation between timed up and go ( tug ) and all subscales of koos .
they reported 0.66 , 0.521 , 0.531 , 0.694 , and 0.561 for pain , symptom , adl , sports , and qol whereas present results for them to 6-mwt was 0.619 , 0.578 , 0.461 , 0.536 , and 0.733 , respectively .
.   found strong correlation between womac and 5-mwt ( r  0.485 , 0.525 , and 0.577 for pain , stiffness , function subscales , respectively , p < 0.001 for all ) .
reported negative correlation between womac pain , function subscales , and 6-mwt ( r  0.205 for pain , p <
similarly , maly et al .   reported mild but significant correlation between 6-mwt , womac pain , and stiffness subscales ( r  0.39 for pain and r  0.48 for stiffness ) .
lin et al .   found mild correlation between womac and physical performance tests in oa knee patients ( r  0.330.54 ) .
.   observed mild but significant correlation between observed and self - reported physical performance ( r  0.200.26 ; p < 0.01 ) .
kennedy et al .   found mild to moderate correlation ( r  0.210.50 ) between self - report and actual physical performance on 1044 knee arthroplasty patients .
stratford et al .   reported moderate correlation between self - reported lower extremity function scale ( lefs ) and tug time ( r 0.42 ) on patients waiting for knee arthroplasty .
.   reported positive correlation between gait cycle and sf-36 pain domain ( r 0.6 - 0.7 , p < 0.001 ) as well as physical function domain ( r 0.5 , p < 0.05 ) .
recently , adegoke et al .   reported a positive correlation ( r = 0.56 ) between self - reported function and actual physical performance ( stair climbing and tug test ) which is similar to our result ( r = 0.461 ) .
reported that weight gain is associated with worsening pain , stiffness , and function in knee pain patients .
miller et al .   reported that 6 monthly changes in weight is correlated with womac pain ( r 0.346 , p < 0.01 ) , stiffness ( r 0.204 ) , and function ( r 0.310 , p < 0.05 ) , respectively .
penserga and tanque   reported a positive correlation between womac ( function ) and weight ( r = 0.260 ) .
correlation between weight and bmi is similar to that of marks   ( 0.764 in present study versus 0.83 and 0.896 in marks ' study ) and their reported r = 0.63 for self - determined walking pace with bmi is similar to our koos - adl with bmi ( r = 0.523 ) .
however contradictory to our finding , marks   reported lower values for vas pain scale with bmi ( r = 0.352 ) .
marks   concluded that bmi was significantly correlated with pain using vas ( r 0.270 , p < 0.01 ) and disability using aims ( r 0.357 , p < 0.01 ) .
reported bmi significantly correlated with all subscales of womac ( p < 0.001 ) and sf-36 but their correlation was < 0.30 .
previous studies also report similar correlation between bmi and womac ( sanghi et al . ;
r = 0.592 , 0.634 , 0.749 for pain , stiffness , and adl subscales in klc et al .   except cubukcu et al .
creamer et al .   reported positive correlation ( r = 0.42 ) between womac function subscale and bmi .
reported mild positive correlation between bmi and sit to stand performance ( r 0.47 , p < 0.01 ) .
marks   concluded that age was not significantly correlated with pain using vas ( r  0.122 ) and disability using aims ( r  0.175 ) .
penserga and tanque   reported lack of correlation between age and womac disability subscales ( r  0.077 ) .
lack of correlation between koos pain ( r 0.093 ) , symptom ( r 0.071 ) , and adl ( r 0.036 ) subscales with age and weak correlation between age and koos qol ( r 0.159 ) subscale in oa knee patients have already been published in our previous publication with larger sample size .
age found to be insignificant correlation with womac pain ( r 0.01 ) and function ( r 0.06 ) subscales in 257 knee arthroplasty patients .
elbaz et al .   also reported similar results in symptomatic oa knee patients using womac ( 0.028 , 0.023 , 0.09 for pain , stiffness , and function subscales , resp . ) .
reported similar result using womac ( correlations between age and womac pain , stiffness , and function were 0.081 , 0.49 , 0.114 , and resp . ; all were statistically insignificant ) . recently ,
maly et al .   in their study found insignificant correlation between age and pain intensity ( r  0.03 ) and physical performance ( r 0.09 ) .
the present study results are in confirmation with previous studies and affirms the usage of koos in indian oa knee patients .","1. Introduction

"genetic alterations in various genes responsible for the maintenance of the normal epithelial phenotype has come forward as a major cause for the deregulation of normal epithelial physiology however , it is well established that genetic mutations are correlated with various environmental stimuli . in addition , direct exposure to various environmental carcinogens is considered one of the most plausible sources of inducing neoplasia . in general ,
mammalian body is very selective in its absorptive behavior which is regulated by size as well as charge of the molecules which body is being exposed .
tight junctions , the most apical cell - cell adhesion , owing to their cellular location are responsible for this selection and any qualitative or quantitative deregulation of the tj characteristics could potentially change the normal equilibrium maintained , resulting in abnormal cellular physiology .
also , the normal regulation of growth factor receptor activation due to differential distribution of the receptor and the respective ligands can be compromised due to irregular tight junctions .
disruption of tight junction barrier function and changes in permeability properties have been shown to be associated with a number of pathologic conditions such as kidney disorders , inflammatory bowel disease , pulmonary edema , diarrhea , and jaundice [ 25 ] .
proper cell - cell and cell - extracellular matrix interactions are essential for normal functioning of an epithelial cell and it is known that various cell adhesion proteins such as e - cadherin , -catenin , or 1-inetgrin perform functions different than their normal cell adhesion function upon loss of normal cell - cell or cell - ecm adhesions . a similar hypothesis could be postulated for the proteins forming the tight junctions , which could probably play a central role in the neoplastic process via coupling of the extracellular milieu to intracellular signaling pathways and the cytoskeleton . in this regard ,
zo-1 , a tight junction protein , binds with the y - box transcription factor zonab that has been shown to increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation .
recently , symplekin , yet another transcription factor , was shown to increase tumorigenicity of the colon cancer cells through the upregulation of claudin-2 and zonab .
importantly , zo-1 and zonab are localized at the tight junction in differentiated and polarized epithelial cells while translocate to the cell cytoplasm / nucleus in proliferative or dedifferentiated cells . in this paper
, we will summarize the current knowledge regarding the role of tight junction with specific emphasis upon the claudin family of proteins in cancer and potential cause and effect association between the expression of specific claudin family members with tumor growth and progression .
tight junctions ( tjs ) are the most apical intercellular junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells .
the two major functions defined for tight junctions are the regulation of paracellular permeability through its barrier function and maintenance of the cell polarity through the fence function [ 10 , 11 ] .
these considerations of polarity , compartmentation , and barrier function are the underpinnings of a fascinating development in biomedicine .
the fence function of tight junction helps in maintaining cell polarity , thus preventing intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane with those in the lateral membrane .
there are certain times in any area of scientific research where one can witness a new concept taking shape and gaining acceptance .
the involvement of epithelial barrier breakdown in the development of epithelial neoplasia is such a concept at present that is gaining acceptance and importance , although it is important to mention that the  roots  of this concept go back many years .
the function of tight junction that is deeply involved in cancer cell biology is epithelial paracellular permeability and the loss of cell polarity [ 12 , 13 ] .  
the concept of epithelial barrier breakdown involves the three mutually interrelated elements that have key consideration in neoplastic growth and development : ( i ) as a result of cell polarity , functional growth factor receptors are normally situated on the basal - lateral cell surface facing interstitial fluid and the bloodstream ; ( ii ) growth factor proteins ( the ligands for these receptors ) are frequently compartmentalized at very high concentrations in luminal fluids within epithelial tissues ; and ( iii ) early in the process of neoplasia ,  distortions  occur in tjs such that relatively large solutes may pass across epithelial barriers that normally restrict their movement , a phenomenon one might call  lesional leak .  for example , in colorectal cancer , expression of claudin-2 that has been correlated with epithelial permeability increases while expression of claudin-1 or 7 that are correlated with increased ter is either mislocalized or is decreased [ 14 , 15 ] .
thus , the concept has developed that tj disruption in premalignant neoplastic tissue can increase the likelihood that it will develop into a frank carcinoma because of the continuous stimulation of cell division of initiated ( premalignant ) cells that follows breakdown of the natural barrier between growth factors and their receptors .  
studies have shown that the epithelial tight junctions are dynamic structures and are subject to modulation during epithelial tissue remodeling , wound repair , inflammation , and transformation into tumors . 
the association of abnormal tj function and epithelial tumor development has been suggested by earlier studies showing alterations in the tj structures of epithelial cancers . in vitro studies using epithelial cell lines demonstrated that monolayers can be transformed into multilayered polyp like structures by oncogenes , such as k - ras , or by phorbol ester tumor promoters .
epithelial multilayering was associated with increased tj permeability [ 22 , 23 ] , activation of protein kinase c-   and phosphorylation of tj proteins .
tight junctions are complex cellular entities and have always been understudied especially because of the lack of the precise knowledge of the proteins constituting them and also due to the difficulties associated with establishing in vivo or in vitro models to determine the true functional characteristics associated with these proteins .
although multiple proteins with diverse biological functions including tumor suppressors such as apc , pten , or cell polarity proteins such as par-3 , apkc are localized at the tight junction location , it was only in the late 1980s that biochemical and immunolocalization studies identified the 225 kda protein zonula occludens-1 ( z0 - 1 ) as the first polypeptide exclusively associated with the tj . zo-2 and zo-3 , which are highly related to zo-1 ,
however , genetic manipulation studies suggested that the zo - family of proteins , although associated with tj are not the tj integral proteins .
immunolocalization by both light and electron microscopy further revealed that all three known zos ( zo-1 , zo-2 , and zo-3 ) are located exclusively at the cytoplasmic surface of tjs in the immediate vicinity of the plasma membrane and not in the plasma membrane . since then , a number of integral membrane proteins associated with the tj have been identified during recent years including occludin , junctional adhesion molecule ( jam ) , and the claudin family of proteins , which consists of at least 24 members   ( figure 1 ) .
the jams are immunoglobulin ( ig)-like single - span transmembrane molecules and mediate ca - independent adhesion .
they are concentrated at tjs as well as ajs , not only in polarized epithelial and endothelial cells but also in hematopoietic cells of all lineages .
these proteins can form homodimers or heterodimers to produce paired strands between adjacent cells , thereby determining the characteristic permeability properties of different epithelial tissues .
occludin with four transmembrane domains was identified as the first tj - specific integral membrane protein .
however , occludin - deficient visceral endoderm cells still bore a well - developed network of tj strands , pointing to the existence of as - yet - unidentified tj - specific integral membrane proteins .   using the same liver fraction employed to identify occludin , and by means of a sucrose step gradient
, a single 22 kda band was discovered as a putative novel tj integral protein .
peptide sequencing revealed two proteins in this band that were subsequently named claudin 1 and 2 .
now , outcome of multiple studies since the initial discovery of claudin-1 and -2 , has established that the claudin family of proteins are the major integral membrane proteins forming the backbone of tight junctions [ 32 , 36 , 37 ] .
the claudin family consists of 24 known transmembrane proteins exhibiting distinct tissue- and development - specific distribution patterns [ 37 , 38 ] .
they are detected in both epithelial and endothelial cells and form a complex with occludin and/or jams [ 32 , 39 ] .
claudins encode 2027 kda proteins with four transmembrane domains , two extracellular loops where the first one is significantly longer than the second one , and a short carboxyl intracellular tail ( figure 2 ) .
the last amino acids of this tail are highly conserved within the family and constitute pdz binding motifs : claudins 19 and 17 s / tyv , claudins 10 and 15 ayv , claudin 11 ahv , claudin 12 htt , claudin 13 ldv , claudins 14 , 18 and 20 dyv , claudin 16 trv , and claudin 19 drv . through these motifs ,
claudins are linked to the tj pdz containing proteins zo-1 , zo-2 , zo-3 , patj   and mupp1 .
a number of other cytosolic and nuclear proteins which includes regulatory proteins rab3b , rab13 , tumor suppressors like pten , transcription factors like zonab , and huash1 have also been shown to interact directly or indirectly with tight junction complex [ 9 , 4345 ] .
these interactions suggest that tight junctions , in addition to acting as barriers to paracellular flow of solutes , may play an important role in regulating other cell functions , such as proliferation and tumor suppression . for example , mutation in cldn14 leads to nonsyndromic recessive deafness   and the mutated cldn16 gene has been associated with hereditary hypomagnesemia   .
mice lacking claudin11 ( also known as occludin sertoli protein ) have demonstrated the absence of tj strands in myelin sheets of oligodendrocytes and sertoli cells in the testis .
they show male sterility as well as delayed axonal conduction rates in the central nervous system .
however , emerging details from a boom of studies related with the claudins in cancer have implicated claudin family members in a wide range of human cancer and in a tissue specific manner .
since their discovery , literature regarding the status of claudins in various cancers is constantly expanding , and in contrast to the general thought that claudins expression would decrease during tumorigenesis as tight junctions are lost during cellular transformation , claudins expression seems to change in a tissue specific manner .
have shown that the expression and distribution of claudin-1 is associated with cell dissociation status in pancreatic cancer cells through mitogen - activated protein kinase 2 activation . by contrast
, claudin-7 has been found to be decreased in invasive ductal carcinomas , head and neck cancer   and metastatic breast cancer . on the other hand , claudin-3 and -4
are frequently elevated in various cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , prostate , uterine , ovarian cancer   and breast cancer   while hepatocellular and renal carcinomas expressed lower levels of claudins-4 and -5 .
while , lower expression of claudin-2 was also seen in breast and prostatic carcinomas , expressions of claudin-1 and claudin-7 that were undetectable in normal cervical squamous epithelium increased in the cervical neoplasia [ 55 , 56 ] .
intriguingly , recent studies have shown that expression of certain claudins especially claudin-1 and claudin-4 increases during metastasis and genetic inhibition of their expression has profound effect on the metastatic abilities of cancer cells though in a tissue specific fashion [ 5759 ] . in table 1 , we have summarized the status of the expression of claudin family members in different cancer types .
intuitively , the mechanism by which decreased claudin expression might lead to the compromised tj function and , thus , neoplasia is easy to comprehend , but how increased claudin expression contributes to neoplastic progression , as described here and by others , is less clear .
one plausible mechanism is that upregulation or aberrant tissue expression of certain claudins may contribute to neoplasia by directly altering tj structure and function .
claudin proteins are likely involved in signaling pathways via binding domains to zo-1 at their carboxyl terminus .
cell - cell adhesion proteins are known to play important role in cellular transformation when displaced from their normal membrane localization and could serve as oncogenic molecule .
the best studied molecules is -catenin , which although serve as cell - cell adhesion molecules when expressed in its normal cellular localization , -catenin becomes oncogenic .
a similar functional heterogeneity could be postulated for claudins however further studies are needed to support such a notion .   in this regard , we have recently demonstrated biological significance of altered claudin-1 expression in colon cancer cells .
an increase in claudin-1 expression was observed in human primary colon carcinoma and metastasis samples and in the cell lines derived from primary and metastatic tumors as compared to their normal counterparts .
an important finding of our study was the nuclear localization of claudin-1 in a significant subset of colon cancer samples , particularly among the subset of liver metastatic lesions .
nuclear localization of several cell junction proteins ( -catenin , zo-1 , zo-2 ) is known to be correlated with oncogenic transformation and cell proliferation [ 61 , 62 ] . as mentioned above , -catenin plays a well - characterized dual role in cell adhesion ( membrane localized ) and in signal transduction ( cytoplasmic and nuclear ) leading to the epithelial cell transformation .
further , mutants of the tj protein zo-1 that no longer localize at the plasma membrane induce a dramatic epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) of madin - darby canine kidney i cells . similarly , genetic manipulations of claudin-1 expression in colon cancer cell lines induced changes in cellular phenotype , with structural and functional changes in markers of epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and had significant effects upon the growth of xenografted tumors and metastasis in athymic mice .
notably , regulation of e - cadherin expression and -catenin / tcf signaling emerged as one of the potential mechanism underlying claudin-1 dependent changes and thereby suggested complex interplay between different cell - cell adhesion molecules .
there is accumulating evidence that the regulation of gene expression of tight junction proteins by the wnt signaling pathway is part of a mechanism essential for the differentiation of epithelial cells , which is imbalanced in oncogenic transformation .
moreover , wnt dependent signal transduction may be one way to influence barrier function which is essentially determined by the epithelial tight junctions . during recent years , a number of components found in junctional complexes of polarized epithelial cells have been shown to have signaling functions involved in cell growth and differentiation .
activation of the wnt pathway leads to the stabilization of -catenin , which subsequently translocates into the cell nucleus and regulates gene expression in association with the lymphoid enhancer factor ( lef)/t - cell factor ( tcf ) family of transcription factors .
lef / tcf are nuclear effectors of the wingless ( wg)/wnt signaling pathway , which is involved in the regulation of cell fate , differentiation , and polarization [ 66 , 67 ] .
mutations in the gene for the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) tumor suppressor protein stabilizes -catenin and are supposed to be crucial events in oncogenic transformation of intestinal epithelial cells , which may develop into adenomas and carcinomas .
claudin-1 and claudin-2 are shown to be target genes regulated by -catenin signaling [ 69 , 70 ] .
not only did expression of claudin-1 decreased significantly in response to the reduction of intracellular -catenin by adenovirus mediated transfer of wild - type apc into the apc - deficient colon cancer cells , but also two putative tcf4 binding elements in the 5 ' flanking region of claudin-1 were confirmed to be responsible for activating its transcription .
further , nuclear effectors of the wnt signaling pathway bind directly to the claudin-2 promoter region and thereby enhance claudin-2 promoter activity .
they further demonstrated a crosstalk between the wnt signaling pathway and cdx related transcriptional activation with regard to claudin-2 promoter - mediated gene expression .
this suggests that wnt signaling directly regulates the claudin-2 promoter via the lef-1/-catenin complex and indirectly enhances claudin-2 gene expression by transcription activation of cdx1 .
importantly , gene expression of another component of the tight junction complex , zo-1 , was suppressed after transient expression of -catenin into human colonic cancer cell lines with low endogenous -catenin , which is suggested to contribute to a loss of epithelial polarization in neoplastic cells .
further , mutation of the apc gene ( thus , -catenin activation and nuclear translocation ) is present in majority of the human colorectal carcinomas .
it is further interesting that colon cancer cells that expressed claudin-1 ( ht29 , sw480 , and sw620 ) all harbor mutations in apc and have activated -catenin / tcf signaling . by contrast , rie and hct116 cells express wild - type apc , and neither cell line expresses detectable levels of claudin-1 , and thus indicated that apc protein can regulate claudin-1 expression in -catenin
similar dependence of claudin-1 expression in colon cancer cells upon apc and -catenin signaling was also shown by others .
metastasis is a complex phenomenon that requires a number of specific steps such as decreased adhesion , increased motility and invasion , proteolysis , and resistance to apoptosis .
claudins expression increase the migration / motility as shown by both boyden chamber and wound - healing assays [ 59 , 74 ] .
expression of claudin-5 not only replaced timp-2 in pro - mmp-2 activation by mt1-mmp but also promoted activation of pro - mmp-2 mediated by all mt - mmps and mt1-mmp mutants lacking the transmembrane domain ( deltamt1-mmp ) .
stimulation of mt - mmp - mediated prommp-2 activation is also reported with other claudin family members including claudin-1 , -2 , and -3 [ 59 , 75 ] .
amino acid substitutions or deletions in the ectodomain of claudin-1 abolished this stimulatory effect and direct interaction of claudin-1 with mt1-mmp and mmp-2 was demonstrated using immunoprecipitation .
mt1-mmp was colocalized with claudin-1 not only at cell - cell borders , but also at other parts of the cell .
thus it appears that interaction of mmp with claudins might play an important role in tumorigenesis , invasion and metastasis mediated by claudin expression . in our studies , we observed that overexpression of claudin-1 in colon cancer cells increased activity of both mmp-2 and mmp-9 while inhibition of claudin-1 resulted in a significant decrease in mmp-9 activity .
similarly , overexpression of claudin-3 or 4 in ovarian epithelial cells increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( mmp-2 ) activity .  
claudin expression and functions are regulated at multiple levels and by diverse mechanisms [ 64 , 76 ] .
delocalization of claudins from membrane appears to be common among the transformed cells [ 59 , 77 ] .
constitutive activation of ras or ras - mediated signaling pathway / s is one of the initial steps during tumorigenesis that is causatively associated with neoplastic transformation . in ha - ras overexpressing mdck cells , tight junction proteins claudin-1 , occluding , and zo-1 were absent from the cell - cell contact sites but were present in the cytoplasm .
inhibition of mek1 activity recruited all three proteins to the cell membrane leading to a restoration of the tight junction barrier function in mdck cells .
however , in yet another study though using breast cancer cells , mek1 inhibition neither affected the mrna or protein levels of claudin-1 , occludin and/or zo-1 nor altered the subcellular cytoplasmic distribution of claudin-1 to be more membrane specific .
further , studies have implicated protein kinase c in the regulation of tjs through phorbol ester stimulation [ 80 , 81 ] .
claudin-3 and -4 can be phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cells by pka , a kinase frequently activated in ovarian cancer   ( figure 3 ) .
furthermore , modulation of map kinase signaling specifically erk 1/2 and p - p38 as well as pi-3 kinase have profound effect upon tight junction sealing and claudin expression .
similarly , lysine deficient protein kinase 4 ( wnk4 ) can phosphorylate multiple claudins and increase paracellular permeability .
most claudin proteins have putative serine and/or threonine phosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic carboxy - terminal domains .
the consequences of the differential modulation brought about by these kinases on these claudins remain to be determined but may contribute to ovarian tumorigenesis .   
growth factor receptors that are important in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival including egf , hgf and igf receptors regulate claudin expression and cellular distribution though once again in cell / tissue specific manner   [ 8588 ] .
in addition , recent studies related to intestinal inflammation have suggested roles of cytokines including tnf- , inf- , il-13 in the regulation of claudins expression .  
endocytic recycling of claudin proteins is also a potential mechanism of claudin regulation , and palmitoylation   of these proteins has also been found to influence claudin protein stability . at the transcriptional level
, transcription factors such as snail , cdx-2 , hnf- , and gata-4 [ 93 , 94 ] can bind to the promoter regions of various claudin genes and affect their expression .
furthermore , we have shown that colonic claudin-1 transcripts are regulated by smad-4 , a known tumor suppressor as well as hdac inhibitors and thus support a complex regulation at multiple levels [ 95 , 96 ] .
irrespective of the diverse source of cancer growth and/or heterogeneity among cancer patients regarding the cancer originated from the same tissue source , it is well accepted that epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is a cellular event central to the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis .
importantly , majority of cancer - related deaths result from the cancers of epithelial origin and include cancers of the colon , prostate , bladder , lung , esophagus , breast , pancreas , ovary , and liver .
although their differentiated properties vary , they are all composed principally of epithelial cells which share similar basic features including polarity and barrier function .
so , the question arises : what underlie the differential properties and/or response to the cancer therapy between cancers originated from different epithelial organs irrespective of the similarities among their basic building units and their properties ?
cell - cell adhesion weakens or is lost during the process of emt or as dedifferentiation of epithelial cells . a critical role of e - cadherin
, principal constituent of adherens junction , in the regulation of emt is known , however it does not help understand the diversity / heterogeneity among the cancers of epithelial origin .
importantly , claudins are expressed in the epithelial cells and in a tissue - specific manner and changes among claudin family members in cancer follow tissue - specific and sometimes contrasting pattern .
thus , claudin family of proteins may hold the potential cue to the heterogeneity among the tumors of epithelial origin and beyond being useful markers may also help provide therapeutic opportunities suited for specific cancer type .","1. Introduction

"this 5-year prospective observational cohort study was performed in a primary care setting to investigate the potential probability of reduction in albuminuria , i.e. , remission from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria and a decrease in albuminuria 50% , to explore the factors associated with the reduction and to assess the effect of reduction on renal prognosis .
subjects were recruited consecutively from japanese patients with t2 dm who were new patients at an outpatient clinic of jiyugaoka internal medicine from 2002 to 2008 ( n = 2,500 ) and met the following criteria at the first visit : macroalbuminuria ( urinary albumin - to - creatinine ratio [ acr ] > 300 mg / g creatinine ( cr ) in a random spot urine ) and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) 30 ml / min/1.73 m. those included had not been treated for diabetes or had not received adequate intensive diabetes treatment .
namely , patients visited the clinic with or without referral letters and with or without prior treatment histories .
the medical team , composed of medical doctors , nurses , and dietitians in the clinic , assessed patients ' diabetic condition and immediately started adequate diabetes care for them according to the clinical practice recommendations for diabetes treatment .
thereafter , patients attended the clinic every month and received appropriate diabetes care and education , which was intended to maintain glycosylated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) values < 7.0% ( 53 mmol / mol ) , blood pressure ( bp ) < 130/80 mmhg , serum concentrations of total cholesterol < 5.2 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl ) , triglycerides < 1.7 mmol / l ( 150 mg / dl ) , hdl cholesterol > 1.0 mmol / l ( 40 mg / dl ) , and bmi 2024 kg / m , as recommended by the japan diabetes society ( jds ) guidelines . in this study , patients who continuously received diabetes care at the clinic for > 1 year were included .
the study was approved by the local ethics committee and was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki ii .
bp was measured in the sitting position after taking a rest of > 5 min .
hba1c was measured by high - performance liquid chromatography , which was certified by the american national glycohemoglobin standardization program .
serum and urinary concentrations of cr were measured by an enzymatic method with an isotope - dilution mass spectrometry traceable calibrator ( n - assay l creatinine kit ; nittoubo medical co. , tokyo , japan ) .
the egfr was calculated using the following equation proposed by the japanese society of nephrology : egfr ( ml / min/1.73 m ) = 194  ( age [ years ] )  ( serum cr [ mg / dl ] )  0.739 ( if female ) ( 9 ) . the new japanese equation is reasonably accurate in estimating gfr for japanese populations and is more accurate than the modified modification of diet in renal disease equation refitted for japanese by overcoming the underestimation of gfr at high values up to 110 ml / min/1.73 m ( 9 ) .
neuropathy was diagnosed in patients with two or more of three components : the presence of symptoms , the absence of ankle tendon reflexes , and abnormal scores of the vibration perception threshold using a c128 tuning fork , where bilateral spontaneous pain , hypoesthesia , or paresthesia of the legs was considered a neuropathic symptom .
the history of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) included ischemic heart disease , ischemic cerebrovascular stroke , and peripheral artery disease .
the urinary albumin excretion was assessed by using acr in random spot urine samples when the subject did not have any urinary tract infections and menstruation .
urinary albumin was measured by a turbidimetric immunoassay . to determine the baseline acr , a single measurement before starting diabetes treatment
however , this was difficult to achieve , since treatments for blood glucose and bp were started immediately based on the patient s intentions , and the inconvenience to patients of repeatedly bringing urine samples should be avoided to enhance the adherence to treatments .
after 1 year of treatment , acr was measured three times a year . at each year
based on the three samples , the stage of nephropathy was defined as normoalbuminuria , microalbuminuria , or macroalbuminuria , corresponding to acr < 30 mg / g cr , 30 acr < 300 mg / g cr , or acr 300 mg / g cr , respectively , in at least two of three samples . the geometric mean from three samples was used as a continuous variable .
remission was defined as stage of albuminuria , determined each year , improved from macroalbuminuria to micro / normoalbuminuria at least once .
the main evaluation of this study was to estimate the rate of remission of macroalbuminuria to acr < 300 mg / g cr and the reduction in acr of 50% from the baseline .
the second evaluation was to investigate the association between reduction in albuminuria and development of renal events , i.e. , doubling of serum cr or onset of esrd .
the decline in renal function estimated by the gfr slope was also compared between those with and without remission and reduction in albuminuria .
this study was also designed to explore the effect of intensive diabetes treatment on the subsequent reduction in acr .
the levels of blood glucose control , bp control , and lipid profiles at the 1-year time point after starting intensified diabetes treatment were used because these variables almost persisted throughout the whole follow - up period .
data are expressed as mean  sd or median ( interquartile range [ iqr ] ) . for comparisons between two groups ,
the unpaired student t test was used for normally distributed variables and the mann - whitney u test for variables with skewed distribution .
statistical significance of the differences for categorical variables between the groups was determined by  test . for each subject ,
a linear regression model of time on gfr ( least - squares method ) was created , and the slope of the regression line was used to estimate the subject s change in gfr over time . then , the gfr slope was expressed as percent per year by dividing the slope by the baseline gfr value .
cumulative incidence of remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr and to acr < 30 mg / g cr was calculated using life - table analysis .
logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratio ( or ) and 95% ci to assess the effect of blood glucose and bp controls on remission of macroalbuminuria . since remission of macroalbuminuria is a categorical analysis , we concomitantly used changes in acr from the baseline to follow - up as a continuous analysis to compensate for the inherent problem associated with the categorical analysis .
cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compute the hazard ratio and 95% ci to assess the effect of obtaining remission and/or the reduction in acr of 50% at the 1-year study time point on the renal events of doubling serum cr or onset of esrd after adjustment for baseline considerable variables .
age , sex , smoking , bmi , systolic bp , hba1c , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , albuminuria , egfr , retinopathy , and prevalent cvd were included in the multivariate model as baseline clinical variables .
all analyses were performed with the statistical software package spss ( spss japan , tokyo , japan ) .
this 5-year prospective observational cohort study was performed in a primary care setting to investigate the potential probability of reduction in albuminuria , i.e. , remission from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria and a decrease in albuminuria 50% , to explore the factors associated with the reduction and to assess the effect of reduction on renal prognosis .
subjects were recruited consecutively from japanese patients with t2 dm who were new patients at an outpatient clinic of jiyugaoka internal medicine from 2002 to 2008 ( n = 2,500 ) and met the following criteria at the first visit : macroalbuminuria ( urinary albumin - to - creatinine ratio [ acr ] > 300 mg / g creatinine ( cr ) in a random spot urine ) and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) 30 ml / min/1.73 m. those included had not been treated for diabetes or had not received adequate intensive diabetes treatment .
namely , patients visited the clinic with or without referral letters and with or without prior treatment histories .
the medical team , composed of medical doctors , nurses , and dietitians in the clinic , assessed patients ' diabetic condition and immediately started adequate diabetes care for them according to the clinical practice recommendations for diabetes treatment .

the new japanese equation is reasonably accurate in estimating gfr for japanese populations and is more accurate than the modified modification of diet in renal disease equation refitted for japanese by overcoming the underestimation of gfr at high values up to 110 ml / min/1.73 m ( 9 ) .

age , sex , smoking , bmi , systolic bp , hba1c , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , albuminuria , egfr , retinopathy , and prevalent cvd were included in the multivariate model as baseline clinical variables . a p value < 5% ( two tailed ) was considered significant .
all analyses were performed with the statistical software package spss ( spss japan , tokyo , japan ) .
about half of the subjects had previously been treated with antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive drugs , but their blood glucose and bp control were insufficient .
diabetic retinopathy and/or neuropathy were present in 165 ( 78% ) patients . during a mean of 4.5 years follow - up ( median 4.2 years [ iqr 2.45.8 ] ) after the initiation of intensive diabetes treatment , 116 patients ( 55% ) obtained remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr , including 28 patients ( 13% ) with acr < 30 mg / g cr ( table 2 ) .
most of the cases obtained the remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr at the 1-year study time point after starting the intensive treatment .
the 5-year cumulative incidences of remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr and < 30 mg / g cr were 58.3 and 18.5% , respectively .
baseline characteristics of t2 dm subjects with acr 300 mg / g cr and egfr 30 ml / min/1.73 m number of patients who obtained remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr or < 30 mg / g cr and the cumulative incidence at each 1-year study time point the clinical characteristics of the study groups stratified by remission of macroalbuminuria ( categorical analysis ) or of those stratified by a reduction in acr of 50% ( continuous analysis ) are shown in table 3 .
both comparisons indicated significantly higher proportions of female sex and nonsmoking in the albuminuria reduction groups .
baseline values of acr were not different between the two study groups in continuous analysis , whereas these were significantly lower in the albuminuria reduction groups in categorical analysis . otherwise , no major differences were found with respect to baseline characteristics among the groups . at 1 year , patients with remission or albuminuria reduction of 50% had lower hba1c and systolic bp levels and a higher proportion taking lipid - lowering drugs .
both categorical and continuous analyses in the whole period of follow - up indicated a clearly beneficial effect of albuminuria reduction on gfr decline and the onset of doubling serum cr or esrd .
the overall incidence of esrd ( per 1,000 person - years ) was 13.6 ( 95% ci 7.323.2 ) , and it was high in subjects with persistent macroalbuminuria ( 25.1 [ 13.442.5 ] ) and in subjects with albuminuria reduction of < 50% ( 35.4 [ 20.356.7 ] ) . clinical data at baseline , at 1 year , and in the whole period of follow - up , which were compared among groups with or without remission to microalbuminuria and normoalbuminuria ( categorical analysis ) and between those with albuminuria reduction of 50% from the baseline and those without ( continuous analysis ) among 116 subjects with remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr , 67 ( 57.8% ) patients remained in remission until the end of follow - up , with a follow - up time of 4.1  2.2 years and a duration of remission of 3.5  2.0 years , and 49 ( 42.2% ) patients relapsed from remission , with a follow - up time of 5.8  2.1 years and duration of remission of 3.4  2.0 years .
no differences were found with respect to clinical characteristics , including renal events between patients without and with relapse , except for the final acr , with the median being significantly higher in patients with relapse ( 323.9 [ iqr 111.3574.6 ] ) than in those without ( 102.0 [ 49.8174.5 ] , p < 0.0001 ) .
the combined effects of systolic bp and hba1c on remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr are presented in table 4 .
patients were stratified according to predefined target levels of systolic bp and hba1c at 1 year .
the achievement of the systolic bp therapeutic target significantly increased the remission rate whether the hba1c target was achieved or not , and bp and blood glucose control increased the remission rate significantly .
of interest , similar significant ors were obtained when the analysis was confined to subjects with higher acr or lower acr divided by the median acr ( data not shown ) , and rates of remission were apparently lower in subjects with higher acr than those with lower acr ( 34.9 vs. 75.2% , p < 0.0001 ) .
furthermore , the rates of patients obtaining remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr according to quartiles of systolic bp at 1 year ( 142 , 141132 , 131124 , and < 124 mmhg ) were 36 , 46 , 68 , and 74% , respectively .
according to quartiles of hba1c at 1 year ( 8.0 , 7.97.3 , 7.26.7 , and < 6.7% ) , the rates were 44 , 50 , 70 , and 56% , respectively .
if continuous data were used , the or ( 95% ci ) for remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr associated with a 10-mmhg decline in systolic bp at 1 year was 2.23 ( 1.483.36 ) ( p < 0.0001 ) and with a reduction of 1% in hba1c was 1.41 ( 1.041.92 ) ( p = 0.03 ) after adjustment for the baseline clinical covariates . rates and adjusted ors for remission to acr < 300 mg / g cr in subjects stratified by achievement of target levels of systolic bp and hba1c at 1 year after starting intensive diabetes treatment finally , the association of the combined effect of remission of macroalbuminuria and reduction of 50% in albuminuria at the 1-year study time point with renal events ( onset of doubling serum cr and esrd ) was investigated .
percentages of the events ( number of events / total number of patients ) were 9.2 ( 8/87 ) , 22.2 ( 2/9 ) , 27.3 ( 6/22 ) , and 29.0 ( 27/93 ) in groups with remission+/reduction+ , remission+/reduction , remission/reduction+ , and remission/reduction , respectively .
as compared with those with no remission and no reduction , hazard ratios ( 95% ci ) adjusted for baseline clinical covariates ( table 4 , model 2 ) were 0.30 ( 0.120.76 ) with obtaining both remission and reduction and 0.79 ( 0.341.82 ) with obtaining either remission or reduction .
we found in this study that 1 ) more than half of patients with macroalbuminuria obtained remission to microalbuminuria after the intensive diabetes treatment in a primary care setting , 2 ) the rate of remission increased according to the achievement of therapeutic targets for bp and blood glucose , and 3 ) the reduction in macroalbuminuria at the 1-year study time point after starting the intensive diabetes treatment was associated with the preservation of renal function .
these results suggest that the progressive decline in renal function of t2 dm with macroalbuminuria can be prevented by adequate diabetes treatment in a primary care setting .
in particular , whether or not the reduction in macroalbuminuria can be achieved soon after starting the intensive diabetes treatment is quite important with respect to renal prognosis .
given that the risk for esrd is directly and strongly related to the level of albuminuria ( 6 ) , and that reductions in albuminuria are associated with reductions in the risk for esrd ( 7 ) , the beneficial effects of the results on such outcomes obtained in the primary care setting can be anticipated in the longer term .
this study showed that the 5-year cumulative incidence rates of remission from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria were 58.3 or 18.5% . to date , a few clinical studies have reported the rate of remission from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria in t2 dm .
the action in diabetes and vascular disease : preterax and diamicron mr controlled evaluation ( advance ) study reported that 229 ( 57.1% ) of 401 t2 dm subjects with macroalbuminuria obtained remission to microalbuminuria ( n = 131 ) or normoalbuminuria ( n = 98 ) in 4.3 years ( 2 ) .
the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes ( accord ) study also indicated that 101 ( 42.6% ) of 237 patients with macroalbuminuria obtained remission over 4.7 years of observation ( 3 ) .
the jddm study also reported that 39 ( 22.3% ) of 136 patients obtained remission over 3.8 years of observation ( 10 ) .
overall , these results clearly indicate that remission of macroalbuminuria in patients with t2 dm is not rare and can be frequently achieved by the adequate diabetes treatment .
notably , remission occurred at the 1-year study time point after starting the intensive treatment in 96 ( 82.8% ) of 116 patients who obtained remission , and the reduction in albuminuria in response to the initial intensive treatment was valuable in terms of predicting renal prognosis
. the high remission rate seen in the early course of treatment may be attributable to insufficient prior controls , or may reflect the preserved renal function at that time . on the other hand , a considerable number of patients did not show a reduction in macroalbuminuria .
male sex and smoking were also associated with unresponsiveness , which is consistent with previous studies indicating that these were risk factors for albuminuria progression and renal function loss in subjects with nephropathy ( 4,5,11 ) .
the unresponsiveness to the intensive treatment may be explained by the existence of irreversible structural alterations in the kidneys or genetic differences , which may be responsible for the variability in responses to treatment . in terms of the effect on remission
it was interesting that the or for obtaining remission was similar between those with higher and lower albuminuria .
this may indicate that there is no threshold of albuminuria that discriminates the response to the intensive diabetes treatment .
the remission rate of 34.9% seen in subjects with higher albuminuria ( > 815.8 mg / g cr ) , together with a report indicating that 26% ( 32/122 ) of patients showed a reduction in nephrotic range albuminuria after aggressive lowering of bp in type 1 diabetes ( 4 ) , may support the commencing of intensive treatment , although the remission rate itself is low due to the severity of existing glomerular damage as reflected by high albuminuria .
in addition , the higher proportion of lipid modification treatment observed in subjects with a reduction in albuminuria may indicate the pleiotropic effect of lipid - lowering drugs on albuminuria reduction ( 12 ) , although differences in lipid profiles were not prominent between the groups .
otherwise , no differences were found between the two . as reported in type 1 diabetes , 46% of subjects who obtained remission of macroalbuminuria experienced relapse ( 5 ) , so this phenomenon of relapse is common .
the implications of relapse should be considered carefully , and longer follow - up is required on this issue .
we should acknowledge that the single measurement of acr at the baseline may have included patients with microalbuminuria because of the physiological variation in albuminuria , leading to an overestimation of remission rate from macroalbuminuria .
however , data on albuminuria in each year after starting the intensive treatment were collected from multiple urine samples , and changes in albuminuria from the baseline level were analyzed in two ways : improvement in stage of diabetic nephropathy and percent albuminuria change from the baseline . a serious problem inherent in an observational cohort study is the reason for censoring .
some censored cases were due to the end of the observation period , but in 30% of the subjects in our study , they were due to loss of follow - up .
loss of follow - up was likely due to moving to other cities / hospitals or discontinuation of treatment .
those due to nonattendance are likely to develop events , since medication noncompliance and clinic nonattendance are closely associated with development of complications ( 13 ) .
this  survival effect  may have yielded an overestimation of remission in this study .
we believe that the present prospective observational cohort simply reflected real - world practice and is valuable and important . in conclusion , this study showed that a reduction in macroalbuminuria of t2 dm subjects frequently occurred and was associated with the preservation of renal function .
this result expands the concept regarding the effect of remission of microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria on the improvement of renal prognosis in patients with t2 dm ( 14,15 ) .
taken together , these results strongly suggest the importance of adequate initial intervention aimed at reducing albuminuria to improve renal prognosis in t2 dm patients in primary care practice .","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

"lipoprotein glomerulopathy ( lpg ) is a rare inherited disease first reported in 1989 by saito et al . .
lpg is sometimes associated with nephrotic syndrome and is characterized by histopathological features of lipoprotein thrombi in extremely dilated glomerular capillaries .
type iii hyperlipoproteinemia ( hlp ) with specific mutations of apolipoprotein ( apo ) e gene is another diagnostic check point .
histologic alterations other than lipoprotein thrombus found in renal lipidosis , such as infiltration of foamy macrophages , mesangial hypercellularity and exudative lesions , are rarely seen in the glomeruli of typical lpg . in the present report , a case that was regarded as a category of lpg by clinical behavior and the gene analysis , but demonstrated atypical histopathological features with foamy macrophage infiltration ,
is described . the combination of alleles for apoe gene tokyo / maebashi and classical apoe2 ( arg158cys ) in this case was inferred to be the leading cause of the unique renal pathology with lipoprotein thrombi and foamy macrophages .
a 25-year - old japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of proteinuria and general edema .
proteinuria and high blood pressure had been detected at a routine medical check - up 3 years earlier .
although his mother suffered from nephrolithiasis , there was no family history of renal diseases such as nephrotic syndrome and renal failure .
at the first visit to our hospital , his height was 172 cm , weight was 76.2 kg , blood pressure was 170/120 mm hg , and pulse rate was 91 bpm .
laboratory findings were as follows : white blood cell count 7,700/l , ( neutrophils 88.0% , lymphocytes 4.0% , eosinophils 4.0% ) , hemoglobin 11.6 g / dl , platelet count 295,000/l , total protein 4.0 g / dl , albumin 1.6 g / dl , hemoglobin a1c 5.3% , serum creatinine 1.36 mg / dl , total cholesterol 887 mg / dl , triglycerides 553 mg / dl , and hdl - cholesterol 45 mg / dl .
serum igg , iga , and igm were 213 , 116 , and 235 mg / dl , respectively .
the serum apoe level was 14.6 mg / dl ( normal range : 2.7 - 4.3 mg / dl ) .
urine protein excretion was 12.9 g / g cr , and urine sediment rbc was 20 - 29/hpf .
after antihyperlipidemic treatment with atorvastatin , the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased substantially , but urinary protein excretion continued in the nephrotic range .
thereafter , the use of probucol and bezafibrate brought a significant decrease in urine protein excretion ( 0.3 g / g cr ) .
though serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were reduced , the serum apoe level did not change with lipid - lowering therapy including bezafibrate ( before 14.6 mg / dl , after 12.4 mg / dl )
the light microscopy specimens contained 40 glomeruli , 7 and 2 of which showed global and segmental sclerosis , respectively .
most glomeruli showed not only typical lipoprotein thrombi filled in the dilated capillaries , but also many infiltrating foam cells ( fig .
immunohistochemical studies using serial sections demonstrated strong staining for both apob and apoe within the dilated capillary lumen filled with lipoprotein thrombi ( fig .
in addition , positivity for apoe was also observed at sites other than lipoprotein thrombi ( fig .
intriguingly , cd68 + foam cells infiltrated in the apoe - positive parts other than lipoprotein thrombi ( fig
electron micrographs for the glomerulus showed intra - capillary lipoprotein thrombus - like substances ( fig .
although lipoprotein thrombi and foam cells were still observed , their number was much lower than on the first biopsy ( data not shown ) .
immunofluorescence examinations showed only non - specific igm deposition along the capillary wall ( data not shown ) .
serum apoe phenotypes were analyzed using isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( ief ) , as previously described . as compared to apoe3/3 of control wild type , the patient had alleles apoe1/2 ( fig .
3a ) . the apoe genotype was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) analysis as described previously .
genomic dna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) using oligonucleotide primers , sense 5-acgcgggcacggctgtccaa - gga-3 and antisense 5-tcgcgggccccggcctggtacac-3. the pcr products were digested with the restriction enzyme hhai .
in addition to the fragments characteristic of genotype 2 ( 91- , 78- , and 36-bp fragments ) , a 30-bp fragment which was not seen in genotype 2 and an around 60-bp fragment which was not detected in any of the common genotype 2 , 3 , or 4 were identified ( fig .
three fragments of genomic dna containing all coding sequence of mature apo e were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers for apo e gene : 5-gctttccaagtgattaaaccgact-3 and 5-agagctaaagccaggagtcag-3 for exon 3 , and 5-cctcttgggtctctctggct-3 and 5-ctgctccttcacctcgtcca-3 , 5-gcagtaccgcggcgaggtgcagg-3 and 5-gatcgtgccac - tgcactcta-3 for exon 4 .
the amplified dna fragments were purified by pcr purification kit ( qiagen , germany ) and directly sequenced with genetic analyzer 3130xl dna sequencer ( thermo fisher , usa ) by using a bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit ( thermo fisher ) .
a heterozygous deletion of 9 bp was identified in codon 141 to codon 143 of the apoe gene ( fig .
this mutation was consistent with apoe tokyo / maebashi mutation in lpg patients , as previously reported .
, apoe tokyo / maebashi mutation seemed to be expressed as the apoe phenotype e1 by ief ( fig .
these findings indicate that this patient was a compound heterozygote for apoe tokyo / maebashi and apoe2 .
written informed consent was obtained from the patient before commencement of the phenotype and gene analysis of apoe .
after antihyperlipidemic treatment with atorvastatin , the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased substantially , but urinary protein excretion continued in the nephrotic range .

a heterozygous deletion of 9 bp was identified in codon 141 to codon 143 of the apoe gene ( fig .
this mutation was consistent with apoe tokyo / maebashi mutation in lpg patients , as previously reported .
because 2 corresponds to apoe phenotype e2 , apoe tokyo / maebashi mutation seemed to be expressed as the apoe phenotype e1 by ief ( fig .
these findings indicate that this patient was a compound heterozygote for apoe tokyo / maebashi and apoe2 .
written informed consent was obtained from the patient before commencement of the phenotype and gene analysis of apoe .
lpg is a rare inherited disease characterized by pathognomonic histologic features such as dilation of glomerular capillaries with huge lipoprotein - rich materials called lipoprotein thrombi .
although type iii hlp is generally recognized in typical lpg , histologic alterations characteristic of renal lipidosis , e.g. , foam cells , sclerosis , and vacuoles , are rarely seen .
, 15 novel apoe variants associated with lpg have been identified , and the histological and clinical manifestations of lpg have been considered to be common among patients with different apoe variants . in the present case ,
lpg was diagnosed based on characteristic lipoprotein profiles and the presence of apoe tokyo / maebashi mutation .
however , a variety of changes in ordinary renal lipidosis were also noticeable ; to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of lpg showing so many macrophages in the glomeruli .
although apoe mutation has been recognized as playing a principal role in the pathogenesis of lpg , some other factors are inferred to be present in the pathogenesis of lpg , because many asymptomatic carriers of apoe variants are recognized . in an animal model ,
kanamaru et al .   found lpg - like glomerular lesions induced by the chronic graft - versus - host reaction in fc receptor ( fcr)-deficient mice .
generated lpg - like changes in apoe and fcr double - knockout mice by injecting various apoe vectors .
these results suggest that macrophage impairment may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the development of lipoprotein thrombi and the absence of macrophages in lpg . from this point of view , other etiological factors besides apoe mutations related to lpg may play an important role in the coexistence of lipoprotein thrombi and foamy macrophages within the same glomerulus in the present case . on the other hand ,
several cases of apoe2 homozygote - related glomerulopathy ( apoe2-gn ) showing marked infiltration of foamy macrophages and sclerosis have been reported .
although apoe2 has extremely reduced binding affinity for ldl receptors , very few apoe2 homozygote cases develop type iii hlp and apoe2-gn .
it is generally believed that apoe2 homozygote cases develop type iii hlp and apoe2-gn , when some genetic , hormonal and environmental factors are added to apoe2 mutation .
actually , most previously reported cases of apoe2-gn were associated with diabetic nephropathy . because there is no evidence of diabetes in the present case , it is possible that mutated apoe related to lpg might play a role as an additional factor in the development of apoe2-gn - like lesions . to the best of our knowledge ,
demonstrated the cases of homozygous e2/e2 with heterozygous apoe single mutation , arg150gly ( apoe okayama ) and arg150cys ( apoe modena ) , respectively .
these two cases showed the distinctive pathological findings of lpg and neither documented the presence of foamy macrophages in the glomeruli .
apoe tokyo / maebashi mutation is a 9-bp deletion ( 3-amino acid deletion ) , whereas all other apoe variants related to lpg are a single - point mutation .
the coexistence of this unique apoe related to lpg and classical apoe2 might be the leading cause of the specific renal pathology with lipoprotein thrombi and foamy macrophages .
on the other hand , one of the 7 patients reported in the case series of lpg from china   seemed to carry the combination of heterozygous apoe tokyo / maebashi and heterozygous apoe2 alleles and show the typical renal pathology of lpg .
the combination of apoe genotypes was likely to be same as our case ; however , the detailed results of apoe dna analysis were not illustrated , and serum apoe phenotype ( e2/3 ) is different from that of our case ( e1/2 ) , although the reason for this is not clear .
an accumulation of more cases of lpg with apoe2 allele is required to elucidate the mechanism of development of lpg and the relationship between macrophage and renal lipidosis . in the first biopsy of the present case ,
cd68 + foam cells infiltrated some part of the apoe - positive region within the glomerulus , but did not exist in lipoprotein thrombi despite apoe positivity .
these results suggest that in type iii hlp occurring with these two apoe mutations , macrophages could recognize apoe2 and infiltrate into the glomerulus to clear lipids including apoe2 , whereas they might not be capable of recognizing apoe derived from lpg - related apoe gene , resulting in an accumulation of lipids in the extracellular area and the development of lipoprotein thrombi .
the histopathological findings in the present case suggest that properties of apoe are crucial in the development of lpg rather than macrophage impairment . in conclusion
, this is the first report of a case of lpg with marked foamy macrophage infiltration in the glomerulus .
the patient was a compound heterozygote for a novel mutation of apoe associated with lpg and classical apoe2 .
it is intriguing that the combination of genes related to lpg and familial type iii hlp expresses renal histology characteristics of both diseases simultaneously .
furthermore , this case seems to provide important clues to understanding the involvement of macrophages in the pathogenesis of lpg and apoe2-gn .
the study of the patient was approved by the institutional ethics committee of saiseikai yamagata saisei hospital , and written informed consent was obtained from the patient before commencement of the phenotype and gene analysis .
the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests regarding the publication of this paper .","Introduction

"acute lung injury ( ali ) and its more severe form , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , are the major causes of death in critically ill patients . despite significant improvements in diagnosis and supportive care ,
evidently , a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying ards from an overall perspective is needed .
the pathophysiologic course of ards is characterized by overwhelming lung inflammation , inappropriate accumulation and activity of leukocytes and platelets , uncontrolled activation of coagulation pathways , and increased permeability of alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers .
ards is a complex clinical disorder developed from a variety of severe conditions such as sepsis , severe pneumonia , and trauma .
it is believed that a number of genes are involved in the development of ards , thereby forming a complete signaling pathway network .
signal pathways regulating innate immunity and antibacterial defenses play a critical role in the development of ards [ 5 , 6 ] .
other pathways regulating angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 and lipid modifications are also implicated in the pathogenesis of ards [ 79 ] .
although numerous studies investigating the pathogenesis of ards have been published during the last decades , most of them mainly addressed a single perspective involved in ards and could not offer an overall view .
thus there remain significant challenges in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying ards . in order to obtain an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of ards , high - throughput assays , including mrna profiles , metabolomics , genetic studies , and proteomics , are required .
proteomics is a high - throughput method that can compare the overall proteins of cells and tissues under different conditions to identify deregulated proteins which may be key mediators of pathogenesis or biomarkers of disease progress or outcome [ 10 , 11 ] .
identified cytochrome b5 and cytokeratin 17 as early markers of ali in a rats model by using the proteomic pf 2d platform ; schnapp et al .
analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) from three ali patients by using proteomics and found that the insulin - like growth factor - binding protein-3 ( igfbp-3 ) concentration was increased in the balf from ali patients when compared to normal controls . by analyzing the changes in protein expression in the balf of ards patients , chang et al .
identified 22 proteins whose expressions had changed and were significantly increased in processes involved in inflammation , immunity , responses to microbials and stress , and/or injury . however , most of comparative proteomic studies reported previously on the pathogenesis of ali / ards were mainly focused on the protein alterations in balf . as far as we know ,
the present study employed a rat model of pseudomonas - induced acute lung injury and utilized a comparative proteomics approach to identifying differentially expressed proteins in the lung tissue in the course of ali .
protein alterations were identified by maldi - tof - ms , and the mrna and protein expression levels of peroxiredoxin1 ( prdx1 ) whose expression was markedly increased in the ali rat lungs were further confirmed by real - time pcr and western blotting analysis .
the upregulation of prdx1 and its biological function were also elucidated in a lps - induced airway epithelium cell injury model in vitro .
the beas-2b immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line was purchased for the american type culture collections ( atcc , rockville , md ) .
cells were cultured as previously described , maintained in 75  cm flasks in dmem / f-12 ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) , and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) ( hyclone , logan , ut ) , in a 95% humidified air incubator , set at 37c , with 5% co2 .
oleic acid and lipopolysaccharides ( lps , pseudomonas aeruginosa 10 ) were purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st . louis , mo ) .
rabbit polyclonal anti - peroxiredoxin 1 antibody was purchased from abcam ( cambridge , ma ) .
antibody for nf-b p65 and -actin was purchased from santa cruz biotechnology ( santa cruz , ca ) .
antibody for -tubulin was purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st louis , mo ) .
all animal protocols were approved by the experimental animal ethics committee of the guangzhou medical university .
sixty adult specific pathogen - free male sprague dawley rats ( 250300  g ) were obtained from the medical laboratory animal centre of guangdong province ( guangzhou , china ) .
the rats were housed in individual cages in a temperature - controlled room with alternating 12  h light / dark cycles and acclimated for one week before the study .
food was removed eight hours prior to the study , but all animals had free access to water .
all animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital ( 50  mg / kg , intraperitoneal injection ) . the rats were randomly separated into two groups : control group ( n = 15 ) and a pseudomonas group ( n = 15 ) . the pseudomonas - induced acute lung injury rat model was generated according to the methods reported previously [ 17 , 18 ] .
briefly , the pseudomonas rat model was induced via intratracheal injection of 0.3  ml phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) containing pseudomonas ( 9  10 colonies forming units / ml ) .
the lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde , embedded in paraffin , sectioned , and stained with haematoxylin - eosin ( he ) according to standard methods .
the lung injury was assessed with a modified scoring system according to alveolar collapse , alveolar hemorrhage , perivascular edema , alveolar edema , polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration , and cellular exudates in a blinded fashion .
scoring categories were none , mild , moderate , and severe ( scores 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , resp . ) .
after animals were sacrificed , tracheotomy was conducted ( seven rats per group ) , and a 22-gauge catheter was inserted into the trachea . with the right bronchus ligated ,
the recovered lavage fluids were centrifuged for 10  min at 5,000  rpm and the supernatants were stored at 80c until further analysis .
concentrations of tnf- and interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) in the balf supernatants were measured using rat - specific elisa kits ( r&d systems , minneapolis , mn ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .
wet - to - dry weight ratios ( w / d ) were measured as described previously . in short , after the experiment the lungs were excised en bloc .
the tissue sample weights were obtained immediately to prevent evaporative fluid loss from the tissues .
lungs were then dried in an oven at 80c for 72  h and the dry weight was measured .
w / d ratios were then calculated as milligrams of water per milligram of dry tissue .
the powder was then put into a prechilled ep tube and homogenized after adding lysis buffer containing 0.5  mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) , 7  m urea , 2  m thiourea , 4% chaps detergent , 2  mm dithiothreitol ( dtt ) , and 2  mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride ( pmsf ) . after standing at room temperature for 30  min ,
the supernatant containing the tissue protein was then collected , and the concentration of proteins was measured using a bradford protein quantification kit ( bio - rad protein assay , bio - rad , richmond , ca ) .
the lung homogenate ( 850  g of protein ) was mixed with rehydration buffer ( 7  m urea , 2  m thiourea , 4% chaps , 2  mm dtt , and 2% immobilized ph gradient ( ipg ) buffer ) .
protein samples were directly applied to ipg strips ( ph 310 , 17  cm ) and rehydrated for 12  h at room temperature .
next , isoelectric focusing ( ief ) was performed using the ipgphor ( bio - rad , richmond , ca ) apparatus .
ief was performed for a total of 80  kvh ( the initial voltage was maintained at 150  v for 1  h , 250  v for 1  h , linearly increased from 500 to 5000  v within 3.5  h , ramped to 10  000  v in 5  h , and maintained at 10  000  v for 60  kvh ) .
the ipg strips were incubated in equilibration buffer ( 6  m urea , 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , 1.5  m ph = 8.8 tris - cl , 20% glycerol ) supplemented with 0.5% dtt for 15  min at room temperature and followed by a 15  min incubation in equilibration buffer with 2.5% iodoacetamide at room temperature .
equilibrated strips were directly loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels ; then the second dimension sds - page ( polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) was carried out at 20  ma per gel with the protean ii xi cell system ( bio - rad , richmond , ca ) .
after sds - page , gels were fixed and protein spots were visualized by coomassie brilliant blue staining .
the 2-de images were scanned by image scanner ii and analysed with image master 2d elite 5.0 software ( amersham biosciences , buckinghamshire , uk ) . to confirm the variations ,
computer analysis facilitated the automatic detection and quantification of protein spots , as well as matches between gels of control groups and pseudomonas groups .
spots displaying reliable and significant differences (  over twofold , p < 0.05 ) were selected for ms analysis .
coomassie blue - stained protein spots on the polyacrylamide gel were excised and transferred into a 0.5  ml microcentrifuge tube , rinsed twice with ddh2o , and then destained in a 1  :  1 solution of 100  mm ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile .
after hydrating with acetonitrile and drying in a speedvac centrifuge , the gels were rehydrated in a minimal volume of sequencing grade porcine trypsin ( promega , madison , wi ) solution ( 20  g / ml in 25  mm nh4hco3 ) and incubated at 37c overnight .
the supernatants were transferred into a 200  l microcentrifuge tube and the gels were extracted once with extraction buffer ( 67% acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid ) . the peptide extract and the supernatant of the gel spot were combined and then completely dried in a speedvac centrifuge .

experimental data for 2-de were analyzed using image master 2d elite 5.0 software and student 's t - test .
morphological changes in lung tissues were examined to determine whether the acute lung injury rat models were established .
he staining showed that no sign of lung damage was observed in the control group , as shown in figure 1(a ) .
however , the pseudomonas group showed hemorrhage and interstitial edema after 24 hours , and infiltrations of inflammatory cells were observed in most of the alveolar spaces . in conjunction with histological changes of the lung tissues , the lung injury score was also significantly higher in the lung injury group , as compared to the control group ( figure 1(b ) ) . to further evaluate the lung injury , pulmonary w / d data and levels of tnf- and il-1 in the balf were assessed .
consistent with histological changes and lung injury score , pulmonary w / d data and the levels of tnf- and il-1 in balf in the injury group were much higher than those in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) , as shown in figures 1(c ) , 1(d ) , and 1(e ) , respectively .
these findings demonstrated that the current model is suitable to be used to investigate the differentially expressed proteins of ali . to investigate the molecular mechanism of pseudomonas - induced lung injury
after 2-de , the gels were scanned and analyzed with image master 2d elite 5.0 software .
an average of 900 protein spots was found on each gel according to the results of the image analysis . among the 878 matched protein spots , 25 protein spots in the pseudomonas group showed greater than twofold differences ( all p < 0.05 ) as compared to the control .
these protein spots were picked up and were then subjected to in - gel digestion and further analyzed with maldi - tof - ms .
eighteen proteins differentially expressed between the lung injury and control group were identified ( table 2 and figure 2 ) .
the proteins are involved in various biological processes according to gene ontology , including metabolic processes ( 33.3% , 6/18 ) , protein binding ( 38.9% , 7/18 ) , signal transduction ( 11.1% , 2/18 ) , and antioxidant activity ( 16.7% , 3/18 ) .
peroxiredoxin 1 ( prdx1 ) , calreticulin , superoxide dismutase 2 , nucleoside diphosphate kinase b , and aldolase a were overexpressed in the pseudomonas groups , whereas apolipoprotein e , glutathione s - transferase alpha 4 , and rakc protein showed lower expression levels .
prdx1 is a member of the peroxiredoxin family that is nonclassically secreted from cells and acts as a mediator of inflammation in prostate cancer [ 23 , 24 ] .
therefore , specific attention was paid to prdx1 which showed the most robust change in expression ( 4.79-fold increase ; table 2 ) in the current study .
to verify proteomic results and assess the expression change of prdx1 showing differential patterns in pseudomonas - induced acute lung injury , real - time pcr , western blot , and immunohistochemistry were performed . as shown in figure 3 ,
both the protein level and mrna level of prdx1 were increased in the pseudomonas - induced lung injury group , which was consistent with results from the proteomic experiments .
our previous study found that prdx1 expression could be elevated under lps treatment in a human bronchial epithelial cell line beas-2b .
it is reported that prdx1 could be secreted from tumor cells and extracellular prdx1 could induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 .
therefore , we examined whether concentration of prdx1 is upregulated in culture medium in bronchial epithelial cells under the challenge of lps .
we used beas-2b cells as a representative airway epithelial cell line to establish the lps - induced acute lung injury cell model .
a dramatic morphological change was observed in the beas-2b cells after a challenge with lps for 24 hours at a concentration at 10  g / ml ( figure 4(a ) ) . as shown in figure 4(b ) , beas-2b cell viability was decreased by treatment with lps in dose - dependent manner at 24 hours .
conditioned media were analyzed by western blotting and we observed a significant increment in prdx1 expression in culture media at 12 and 24 hours after 1  g / ml and 10  g / ml of lps treatment ( figure 4(c ) ) .
-tubulin was not detected in the conditioned media ( figure 4(c ) ) indicating the absence of cell lysis .
we also detected the concentration of prdx1 in media by elisa and results demonstrated that the concentration of prdx was increased in a dose - dependent manner after lps treatment as compared to the control ( figure 4(d ) ) .
these results indicated that the expression level of prdx1 in culture medium was increased under the exposure of lps in lung epithelium cells . in order to explore the significance of prdx1 upregulation in acute lung injury , a prdx1 expressing vector and a prdx1 sequence specific shrna expression vector were constructed and transduced to the beas-2b cell .
as shown in figure 5(a ) , the protein level of prdx1 was increased under the ppscv - prdx1 transduction as compared to the vector transduction .
we next determined the effect of prdx1 overexpression on il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- after lps treatment in beas-2b cells .
prdx1 overexpressed beas-2b cells showed a significant increase of il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- expression compared to the control group .
prdx1 overexpressed cells did not show further increase of il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- expression after challenge with lps , indicating that prdx1 expression alone could upregulate the inflammation in beas-2b cells .
furthermore , the impact of prdx1 expression on cytokine expression was evaluated in prdx1 knockdown beas-2b cells .
four psuper - prdx1 shrna plasmids were constructed and then transfected into the beas-2b cells and results showed that transfection with the shrna#3 led to the marked reduction of prdx1 expression ( figure 5(b ) ) .
therefore , shrna#3 was used in the following experiments . as shown in figure 5(d ) , the depletion of prdx1 expression caused considerable downregulation of il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- expression in prdx1 shrna transduced beas-2b cells compared to vector transduced cells with lps treatment .
moreover , treatment with lps in prdx1 knockdown beas-2b cells did not show an increase of il-8 and tnf- expression .
these results implying prdx1 might play a role in lps - induced inflammation in lung airway cells . the nf-b signaling pathway is known to play a critical role in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production .
nucleic fractions of the cell lysates were extracted and the expression of p65 protein was analyzed by western blotting analysis . as shown in figure 5(e ) , expression of prdx1 increased the amount of nf-b p65 protein in the nuclear fraction , whereas knockdown of prdx1 by shrna reduced nucleus accumulation of the p65 protein .
this suggests that prdx1 expression modulated the expression of cytokines through the nf-b signaling pathway .
in the current study , we employed a high - throughput proteomic approach to identifying the global proteome alterations of lung tissue using a rat model with bacterially induced acute lung injury .
proteomic analysis revealed 18 differentially expressed proteins , of which 11 were upregulated and 7 were downregulated in ali lung tissues , as compared to the normal control .
these differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with cellular metabolism , antioxidation , signal transduction , and protein binding .
prdx1 overexpression was verified by western blot , real - time pcr , and ihc analysis .
an in vitro study using an airway epithelium cell model showed that prdx1 expression was upregulated in culture medium under the challenge of lps .
moreover , overexpression of prdx1 and knockdown of its expression promoted and inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines , respectively . finally , our results indicated that prdx1 promoted inflammatory processes via the nf-b signaling pathway .
findings from the current study provide a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying bacterially induced ali .
it has been reported that diffuse increase in metabolic activity is observed in the lungs of ali and ards patients and that this increased activity indicates the presence of an inflammatory process [ 27 , 28 ] . in the current study ,
changes in eight proteins that were involved in cellular metabolism were identified , as shown in table 2 .
these results strongly suggest that significant metabolic dysregulation occurs in pseudomonas - induced acute lung injury , perhaps because of the existence of inflammation and excessive epithelium and endothelium damage in lungs of ali patients . among other differentially expressed proteins ,
for example , rho - associated protein kinase 1 ( rock ) , which is the downstream target of rho gtpases , is believed to play an important role in the regulation of the endothelial cell actin cytoskeleton .
it is a mediator of tnf- and vascular endothelial growth factor- ( vegf- ) induced endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular barrier dysfunction , which are both key ali pathophysiological characteristics [ 29 , 30 ] .
calreticulin ( crt ) , a multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum luminal ca - binding chaperone , was found to stimulate the antioxidant pathway and was able to protect a549 human type ii alveolar epithelial cells by diminishing reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , which are key signaling molecules mediating many types of cell injury [ 31 , 32 ] .
furthermore , crt gene expression was significantly upregulated in catfish under the challenge of infectious gram - negative bacteria through reducing excess ros .
a study shows that the concentration of hemoglobin in the balf was significantly increased in ards patients .
however , whether the rest of the proteins which showed differential expression play roles in the pathogenesis of ali or just act as innocent bystanders remains unknown and needs further investigation .
peroxiredoxin 1 ( prdx1 ) , a finding worthy of note , was the top overexpressed protein in the bacterially infected group relative to the control group , thus encouraging us to explore what specific role prdx1 may be involved with in the development of ards .
therefore , we validated the overexpression of prdx1 by rt - pcr , western blot , and immunohistochemistry in the lung tissue from ali rats .
we also found that the overexpression of prdx1 was mainly observed in airway epithelial cells , which are the primary defensive barrier against various attacks from the external environment and thus are frequently injured in ards .
our previous study demonstrated that prdx1 expression was elevated under lps treatment in a human bronchial epithelial cell line beas-2b . here , we further studied whether the expression of prdx in the culture medium could be increased under the challenge of lps in vitro .
our results demonstrated that prdx1 expression in culture medium was substantially upregulated under the challenge of lps .
interestingly , although the treatment with lps at 12 hours did not cause significant cell death in beas-2b cell , the expression level of prdx1 in conditioned media after lps treatment at 12 hours was even higher than that in conditioned media after lps treatment at 24 hours .
thus , we speculate that extracellular prdx1 in culture medium is mainly secreted from live cells rather than released from dead cells .
it is reported that various oxidative stress stimuli including hydrogen peroxide and sulfhydryl reactive agents are able to upregulate the prdx1 gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages [ 35 , 36 ] .
treatment of lps in epithelial cells or macrophages results in production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) which causes oxidative stress [ 37 , 38 ] and nrf1 ( nf - e2 related factor-1 ) and nrf2 ( nf - e2 related factor-2 ) , two oxidative stress - sensitive transcription factors , interact with mafg to upregulate the transcription of many antioxidant genes including prdx1 when activated by oxidative stress [ 3941 ] .
therefore , upregulation of prdxi gene expression by lps in beas-2b cells is considered to be a cellular response to oxidative stress .
another study also indicated the upregulation of prdx1 by lps treatment involved with the src / pi3  k / jnk signaling pathway which was activated by the treatment of lps in raw 264.7 cells .
we then modulated the expression of prdx1 in beas-2b cells in order to study the effects of prdx1 expression on the ability to influence lps - induced inflammatory processes in the airway epithelium .
surprisingly , results showed that overexpression of prdx1 in beas-2b cells significantly leads to increases in levels of the proinflammatory cytokines il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- , and knockdown of prdx1 expression inhibited the expression of these cytokines , even under the challenge of lps .
overall , our results revealed that high expression of prdx1 might be an important mediator of lps - induced lung epithelial cell injury .
prdx1 is a member of the typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin family , whose major intracellular functions are as a protein chaperone and a regulator of hydrogen peroxide signaling through its peroxidase activity .
peroxiredoxins efficiently catalyze the breakdown of h2o2 and alkyl peroxides to eliminate intracellular ros produced in response to epidermal growth factor and tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation .
however , besides its intracellular functions as a member of the peroxidase family and a protein chaperone , prdx1 can be secreted via a nonclassical secretory pathway by non - small cell lung cancer cells [ 24 , 35 ] .
it has been showed that extracellular prdx1 acted as a toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) ligand and stimulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tnf- and il-6 from macrophages and dendritic cells .
shichita et al . also demonstrated that the peroxiredoxin family , including prdx1 , contributed to the induction of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and extracellular peroxiredoxins are danger signals in the ischemic brain .
this suggests that prdx1 may function as an endogenous damage - associated molecular pattern molecule ( damp ) .
interestingly , the prdx1 level in the balf of ards patients was much higher as compared to healthy controls . taken together , we propose that prdx1 expression level is upregulated in airway epithelial cells which are extensively damaged in ali by various insults , such as lps , and it is subsequently secreted from the epithelium to act as a damp to promote inflammation in the process of ali . finally , previous investigation has reported that extracellular prdx1 could motivate the tlr - myd88 signaling pathway by binding to tlr4 , which leads to nuclear translocation and activation of the nf-b pathway .
we showed that overexpression of prdx1 promotes nuclear translocation of p65 , and conversely knockdown of prdx1 expression by shrna in beas-2b cells results in reduction of p65 expression in the nucleus .
thus , our results provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that prxd1 increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by activating the nf-b pathway .
it is a well - known fact that cytosolic prdx1 scavenges the ros such as intracellular h2o2 to block the activation of nf-b signaling pathway [ 39 , 40 ] .
extracellular prdx1 binds to the surface tlr4 resulting in activation of nf-b and acts as a proinflammatory factor [ 26 , 41 ] .
thus , therapies targeting extracellular prdx1 , such as utilization of neutralizing antibody against prdx1 , might be an effective way to attenuate the inflammation response in ali .
first , we did not use prdx1-deficient animals to strongly demonstrate that prdx1 contributes to the pathogenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa - induced ali .
however , a study from other investigators has indicated that prdx1 null mice exhibited reduced acute lung inflammation in o3-induced pulmonary inflammation and suggested that prdx1 plays a positive role in the development of lung inflammation instead of being an effective protector against o3-induced oxidative damages .
second , we did not study the effects of upregulated extracellular prdx on other cell types such as neutrophil cells and macrophages which also play key roles in the pathogenesis of bacterially infected ali .
in conclusion , for the first time , we established the well - reproducible 2-de profiles of lung tissue proteins in a pseudomonas - induced ali rat model and revealed the proteomic profile of the lung tissue . through this proteomic approach , we identified 18 differentially expressed proteins which are mainly involved with energy metabolism , antioxidation , protein binding , and signaling transduction .
further investigation showed that prdx1 plays a role in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression .
insights gained from current studies indicate that prdx1 may present a potentially new therapeutic target against ali .","1. Introduction

"probiotics are now widely considered as beneficial bacteria which have various good effects on the human beings ; among them , lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are the most common ones [ 14 ] .
the advantages posed by these probiotics carry the potential to be used in clinical practices , such as diabetes , oral health , atopic diseases , liver diseases , urogenital infections , normal immune function , virus infections , and even the anticancer capabilities . until now
, several studies have been conducted to elucidate the relations between colorectal cancer and probiotics .
probiotics are able to maintain the balance of microflora and also decrease the oxidative stress in the gut .
some studies even indicated that the consumption of probiotics is a potential way to prevent the cancer [ 5 , 6 ] .
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) are mainly composed of t - cells , b - cells , monocytes , and natural killer cells ( nks ) . these cells play critical roles in maintaining the proper immune function in response to the environmental stimulus . additionally , pbmcs are also good and easily accessible resources , which makes them become an attracting target for investigating immune system . among pbmcs ,
basically , nk cells protect the host by eliminating the invasion of microorganisms and also inhibiting the process of malignant transformation ; thus , the cytotoxicity of nks should be kept in a normal range [ 8 , 9 ] .
the lower nk cytotoxicity has been connected to the severity of several diseases , such as chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome , atherosclerosis , myeloproliferative disorders , and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
besides , several studies have shown that decreased nk numbers and killing ability are correlated with cancer progress .
.   showed that patients with hepatitis b cirrhosis and liver cancer had significant lower nk cytotoxicity and number compared with healthy people .
liu et al .   have indicated that the metastasis of prostate cancer is positively associated with the loss of peripheral nk cells .
also , higher cytotoxicity of nk cells has been shown to prevent the colorectal cancer risk . taken together ,
, several reports have demonstrated that certain strains of probiotics could enhance the nk activities in human trials . in an earlier report , the authors demonstrated that elderly people who consume fermented milk which contained l. casei shirota exhibit elevated nk activity in 3 weeks ; however , this phenomenon disappeared after 6 weeks .
more recently , reale et al .   showed that the smokers can restore their nk function if they have daily intake of l. casei shirota within 3 weeks .
these data suggested that probiotics may have positive effects on the nk functions ; however , these studies only included one probiotic strain and it seems that the efficacy of the probiotics decreased when the time is prolonged ( 3 weeks ) .
consequently , the current knowledge about the correlation between nk and probiotics is still incomplete and more studies are needed to be conducted to confirm this phenomenon . in the present study , we attempted to observe the efficacy of taking personalized probiotics on nk activity based on the ratio of ifn- to il-10 .
the blood samples were collected from 100 volunteers . for comparison , people were divided into 3 groups which were ifn- , il-10 , and control group .
the numbers and average age of participants in these three groups are as follows : ifn- : n = 69 , age  55 ; il-10 : n = 21 , age  57 ; control : n = 10 , age  53
. in ifn- group , the pbmcs from participants were stimulated with 6 probiotic strains and they were asked to take the specific probiotic capsule ; this probiotic showed the highest ability to stimulate the secretion of ifn- based on the ratio of ifn- to il-10 .
in contrast , people in il-10 group took the probiotics that exhibited the highest il-10 to ifn- ratio , while the control group had no consumption of probiotics .
the volunteers in both ifn- and il-10 groups were asked to take 2 capsules of probiotics one day .
this study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and approved by the ethical committee of bio ray biotech inc .
the six strains are l. paracasei brap01 ( bio ray biotech ) , l. acidophilus ad300 ( biena ) , b. longum ba100 ( biena ) , e. faecium br0085 ( synbio ) , l. rhamnosus ad500 ( biena ) , and l. reuteri br101 ( bio ray biotech ) .
ficoll - paque ( ge ) separation method was conducted to isolate the pbmcs from the blood .
briefly , 10  ml of blood was diluted to 14  ml with pbs and then the diluted blood was carefully layered on top of the ficoll - paque solution .
after centrifugation , the pbmcs were separated from the blood cells and stored in pbs after one - time wash by pbs .
the purified pbmcs were cultured with 6 different probiotics in rpmi-1640 ( ge ) medium with 10% fbs ( gibco ) , 1x glutamine ( biowest ) , and psn ( gibco ) in a 96-well culture plate ( spl ) .
the plate was put in a co2 incubator for 40 hours ( 37c , 5% co2 ) .
finally , the plate was centrifuged at 250  g and the supernatant was collected and stored in 20c . to avoid the uncertainty of experiments
, we used an automatic and customized microfluidic system ( agnitio bioic system ) to detect the amount of ifn- and il-10 secreted by pbmcs . for detection , 200  g / ml anti - ifn- antibody ( bd ) and 400  g / ml anti - il-10 antibody ( bd )
were immobilized in the chips and the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) was performed to detect ifn- and il-10 . in brief , all the working solutions were prepared before going through the automatic process .
for each solution , there existed a corresponding well to add the buffers of the chip .
conjugate buffer contains 1000-fold dilutions of 0.5  mg / ml biotinylated anti - ifn- antibody , 0.5  mg / ml biotinylated anti - il-10 antibody , and 1000x streptavidin - hrp ( bd ) .
when buffers were loaded to each well , the chip was inserted into the agnitio bioic pumping machine .
when washing step was finished , the chip was analyzed by the agnitio bioic analyzer . to assess the cytotoxicity of nks from pbmc , we measured the lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) released from target cells to determine the cytotoxicity of effector cell to target cell   and the kit was purchased from promega . in this experiment ,
the cancer cell line k562 was target cell to evaluate the cytotoxicity of nk cell ( effector cell ) .
the experiment includes several control groups to be the reference of this assay and the incubation buffer is rpmi-1640 ( ge ) with 5% fbs ( gibco ) .
each group is as described below : the effector spontaneous control group : pbmcs only , the target spontaneous control group : k562 cell only , the total lysis group : k562 cell and lysis buffer , the volume correct group : incubation buffer with lysis buffer , experimental group : pbmcs and k562 cell .
the effector spontaneous control group : pbmcs only , the target spontaneous control group : k562 cell only , the total lysis group : k562 cell and lysis buffer , the volume correct group : incubation buffer with lysis buffer , experimental group : pbmcs and k562 cell . in the beginning
, the pbmcs were cocultured with k562 at a ratio of 25  :  1 ( effector cell / target cell ) at 37c with 5% co2 for 4 hours in a 96-well plate .
after incubation , the plate was centrifuged at 250  g for minutes and then 50  l aliquot of supernatant was transferred to a 96-well elisa plate ( spl ) .
finally , add 50  l of stop solution to each well and measure the od492 with an elisa reader ( tecan infinite m200 ) .
the calculation of cytotoxicity percent of pbmcs to k562 is performed using the following formula : cytotoxicity percent % = ( experimental group  effector spontaneous group  target spontaneous group)/(total lysis group  volume correct group  target spontaneous group )  100% .
the data analysis was performed in perl 5.0 and the statistical calculation was done in r 3.0 .
the first process of this study is to determine the personalized probiotics from six probiotic strains ( l. paracasei brap01 , l. acidophilus ad300 , b. longum ba100 , e. faecium br0085 , l. rhamnosus ad500 , and l. reuteri br101 ) for each participant by the microfluidic chip assay .
the microfluidic chip was displayed in figure 1 ; compared to the traditional elisa process , this platform avoids the manual error because the reactions of each process were automatically performed .
this table displays the percentage of ifn-/il-10 or il-10/ifn- ratio of six probiotics for specific subjects .
for instance , in the left part of table 1 , the subject took the l. paracasei brap01 as his own personalized probiotics , while , in the right part , the person took the l. reuteri br101 for comparison . by doing so , people in ifn- group consumed the probiotics that had the highest effect on the production of ifn- and this condition was opposite in the il-10 group .
the purpose of this experimental design is to separate the subjects into two different groups and we want to clarify the influence on nk activity based on these two totally different approaches .
the observation of the efficacy of taking personalized probiotics on the average nk cytotoxicity of all the participants was displayed in table 2 .
it is clear that , after six months , a significant increase was noticed in ifn- group .
the cytotoxicity value raised around 6.3% and the p value was lower than 0.005 . in il-10 group ,
a slightly increasing trend can be seen ( ~1.4% ) ; however , the p value ( 0.117 ) showed no statistical difference between the first test and the second test .
for control , the value dropped about 3% in six months . in the ifn- group ,
some of them even showed a substantial increase compared to the first time ( over 20% ) . in control group
, the change seems not obvious within six months , since the sd of variation of nk cytotoxicity was much lower than the ifn- group . in the il-10 group , a mild increase in the nk cytotoxicity was observed ; however , in comparison to ifn- group , the raising performance was much lower than that . from this analysis , it is distinctly indicated that people 's taking of the probiotics with the highest ratio of ifn-/il-10 leads to a significant increase in their nk cytotoxicity against k562 cancer cell line . in the previous reports
, researchers have demonstrated that , after three weeks , the effectiveness of probiotics on nk activity was vanished [ 17 , 18 ] ; however , our results showed that the efficacy of probiotics was able to persist in six months .
this indicated that the personalized probiotics based on the ratio of ifn-/il-10 strategy could be a promising methodology to activate or restore the tumor killing capability of human peripheral immune system .
in addition to the global analysis of the nk activity before and after the probiotics consumption , the contributions of individual probiotics were also analyzed .
the summary of nk cytotoxicity change with probiotics is displayed in table 3 ; for ifn- group , l. paracasei brap01 and l. acidophilus ad300 account for a large portion of the entire group and the percentage of l. reuteri br101 was zero .
in contrast , l. reuteri br101 constituted about 48% in il-10 group , while the l. paracasei brap01 and l. acidophilus ad300 were not observed in the il-10 group .
for e. faecium br0085 , it had only 3% in ifn- group and increased to 29% in the il-10 group .
l. rhamnosus ad500 was relatively even distributed in both groups compared to other strains . from our bacteria profiles
, it is apparent that l. paracasei brap01 and l. acidophilus ad300 tend to induce the ifn- production from pbmcs .
oppositely , l. reuteri br101 and e. faecium br0085 are the potent agents to make pbmcs produce il-10 . from previous studies ,
l. paracasei and l. acidophilus have been shown to improve the allergy status of humans such as rhinitis [ 20 , 21 ] .
our result also suggested that l. paracasei and l. acidophilus are two dominant probiotics to induce the ifn- production , and ifn- has been reported to inhibit the th2 cytokine production which is considered to cause the allergic inflammation .
our results were in agreement with these studies , since we also showed that these 2 strains were effective ifn- inducer . in a mouse model study
, they demonstrated that l. reuteri compensated the anti - inflammation function of il-10 lacking mouse suggesting that this bacteria can restore il-10 competency for host .
yet another study indicated that the l. reuteri rc-14 exerted downregulation of il-10 in the patients with neurogenic bladder of spinal cord injury .
these results showed that l. reuteri may exhibit different immune regulatory effects under diverse conditions , while , in this study , we showed that l. reuteri was the most efficient one to induce il-10 other than ifn- among the six strains . except for the dominant probiotics for ifn- or il-10 groups , the other probiotics , b. longum , e. faecium , and l. rhamnosus ,
were presented in both ifn- and il-10 group suggesting the bidirectional roles for immune regulation that they may play , which means the same probiotic strain may have particularly dissimilar influence on different persons . besides the analysis of occurrence of each probiotic , table 3 also displays the overall performance of 6 probiotics on the nk activity .
as mentioned in previous section , ifn- group mediated a significant increase in nk cytotoxicity but not in il-10 group .
it is clear that the average nk cytotoxicity variations of 5 strains in ifn- group were all positive ( except for l. reuteri br101 , which was zero occurrences ) . in the il-10 group ,
only e. faecium br0085 showed greater ability to increase the nk cytotoxicity and the other strains were all below the average value ( 1.4% ) .
some of them were even negatively correlated with the nk cytotoxicity tendency ( b. longum ba100 : 1.33% , l. rhamnosus ad500 : 7.66% ) .
detailed variations of the probiotics effects on nk activity were displayed in figure 2(a ) ( ifn- group ) and figure 2(b ) ( il-10 group ) . in figure 2 , although a larger portion of probiotics showed great potency to increase nk cytotoxicity , the nk activity seemed not improved of some participants .
however , by comparison of ifn- and il-10 group , it is still an evident distinctness between these two groups .
an apparent increasing tendency was observed in ifn- group , while this phenomenon disappeared in il-10 group . in ifn- group ,
e. faecium br0085 exhibited promising ability to increase the nk cytotoxicity and the average value is 41.8% .
this value is about 7 times larger than the average value of all 6 probiotics ( 6.3% ) ; however , the sample size is too small for e. faecium br0085 ( only 2 ) .
thus , it could be argued that this phenomenon may disappear when the subject number increases . in il-10 group ,
again , e. faecium br0085 was still the most effective agent ( n = 6 ) to stimulate the nk activity in il-10 group as shown in figure 2(b ) .
consequently , the probiotic strain , e. faecium br0085 , showed a good potential to stimulate the cancer killing ability of nk cells and this mechanism may not rely on the production of ifn- or il-10 ; however , more evidence is needed to support this observation .
in this pilot study , we showed that taking the probiotics with the highest value of ifn-/il-10 can enhance the cytotoxicity of nk cells after six months .
this result also suggested that even the same strains of probiotics possibly have different or opposite effects on the hosts .
thus , it should be noted that a deep evaluation of probiotics is required when we want the certain effect of a probiotic , since it could be useful to some people but useless to others . as mentioned before ,
some studies have been conducted to show the advantages of probiotics in elevating the nk function in mouse and human models [ 25 , 26 ] ; however , there is no comprehensive study to investigate the relations between probiotics and nk cell activity .
herein , we showed that people who took the probiotics which had the highest value of ifn-/il-10 among 6 strains will also have significantly higher nk activity after six months in comparison to the other 2 groups ( il-10 and control group ) . based on the results
, we proposed that the probiotics which are highly active to induce the ifn- production other than il-10 from host have great potency to become effective nk activated agents .
several papers have reported that the nk activity was highly related to the amount of ifn-. a survival study on gastrointestinal stromal tumor - bearing patients revealed that the higher nk cell and ifn- production was a predictor for a long term survival of these patients .
another paper showed that the decreased nk cytotoxicity and ifn- level were associated in breast cancer patients and this decrement also related to the progression of this disease .
ifn- has been characterized to enhance the nk cell cytotoxicity by increasing the tumor cell 's sensitivity to the nk mediated killing process .
in fact , nk cell can release ifn- to stimulate the dendritic cells ( dcs ) to produce il-12 , and then il-12 will amplify the ifn- production from nk cell .
, a paper demonstrated that , under the systemic infections by pathogens , nk cell released il-10 to inhibit the il-12 production by dcs .
another study demonstrated that , under the bacteria infection , il-10 suppressed the nk activity . taken together , we proposed that the rationale for probiotics to trigger nk cell mediated cytotoxicity is via the indirect effect .
for example , when dc cells are under the stimulation of highly active ifn- producing probiotics , this may lead to the secretion of il-12 by dcs which can maintain a proper feedback loop of dc to nk . in conclusion
, this paper attempted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of probiotics on nk activity .
although we successfully showed that people who took the probiotics with higher ifn-/il-10 value could enhance the nk cytotoxicity , some people in the ifn- group had decreasing nk activity suggesting that the variation of immune response among people is remarkable .
this may be due to the insufficient dosage of probiotics taken by participants or because the probiotics we chose were not suitable for them .
however , this pilot study demonstrated that the consumption of probiotics for individuals should be carefully concerned and the value of ifn-/il-10 could be a potential biomarker to evaluate the usage of probiotics to some extent .","1. Introduction

"current understanding on the pharmacokinetics of drugs in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( hie ) is limited .
in addition to brain injury , global hypoxic insult often results in acute liver and kidney injury that can impact drug clearance.(15 ) in addition , therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for moderate to severe hie(6 ) with the potential to alter drug pharmacokinetics through changes in organ physiology and blood flow.(7 ) considering these factors , drug pharmacokinetics must be evaluated in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia.(7 ) .
gentamicin is commonly used in neonates with hie for the empiric treatment of presumptive infection.(7 ) a previous study demonstrated no impact of hypothermia on trough concentrations in hie neonates.(8 ) however , in this same study a gentamicin dose of 45 mg / kg every 24h resulted in elevated trough concentrations , i.e. > 2 mg / l in 36% of hypothermic and 44% of normothermic neonates .
a population pharmacokinetic analysis of gentamicin in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia also reported frequent elevations in trough concentrations using a similar dosing scheme.(9 ) a dosing interval of every 36 hours was predicted to be needed to allow for adequate drug clearance and achieve target trough concentrations < 2 mg / l .
accordingly , our institution recently changed the empiric dose of gentamicin for neonates with hie receiving hypothermia from 5 mg / kg every 24h to 5 mg / kg every 36h . the goal of the present study was to evaluate the impact of this change in dosing frequency on target drug concentration achievement .
this study was approved by the ucsf committee on human research . in january 2011 , the neonatal intensive care unit ( nicu ; a fifty - bed level iii unit located in a tertiary care , academic medical center ) at the university of california san francisco ( ucsf ) adopted a revised empirical gentamicin dose of 5 mg / kg iv every 36h for neonates with hie receiving therapeutic hypothermia . prior to this time , the recommended gentamicin dose was 5 mg / kg iv every 24h . using retrospective chart review , the initial gentamicin peak and trough concentrations in the study population ( neonates with hie treated with whole - body therapeutic hypothermia ( 33.5c ) ) pre and post implementation of the every 36h dosing regimen were evaluated .
the evaluation time periods were the following : november 2007 to march 2010 ( gentamicin 5 mg / kg iv every 24h ; q24h period ) and january 2011 to may 2012 ( gentamicin 5 mg / kg iv every 36h ; q36h period ) .
cooling criteria and protocol remained the same between the two treatment periods.(10 ) all neonates were started on gentamicin for a  rule - out sepsis as part of the cooling protocol .
gentamicin dosing guidelines are disseminated at ucsf using an antimicrobial dosing card distributed to all residents , clinical pharmacists and faculty physicians .
as part of standard therapeutic drug monitoring ( tdm ) , a trough concentration was recommended after the 2nd or 3rd dose during both treatment periods .
peak concentrations were not recommended during the q24h period but were recommended during the q36h period due to the inexperience with the new dose . in those instances associated with acute renal failure ( i.e. elevated or rapidly rising serum creatinine ) ,
gentamicin peak concentrations were drawn 30 minutes after the end of a 30-minute infusion , and trough concentrations were drawn just prior to the next dose .
clinical and laboratory data , including the complete gentamicin dosing and drug concentration history , were collected .
neonates were excluded if the gentamicin dose or drug concentration history were not available or incomplete , ecmo was required , or with the presence of concomitant congenital heart disease or kidney disease .
mg / l to 24 mg / l ( advia centaur gentamicin assay , bayer diagnostics , deerfield , il ) . differences in peak and trough concentrations between treatment periods were compared using student s t - test .
the percentage of neonates achieving target trough concentrations was compared using fisher - exact test . to examine
if gentamicin clearance ( cl ) was similar between treatment periods and not confounding drug concentration achievement , an empirical bayesian estimate of cl was calculated for each neonate implementing our published population pharmacokinetic model(9 ) in the nonlinear mixed - effects modeling program nonmem ( version vii , icon development solutions , ellicott city , md ) . in the pharmacokinetic model gentamicin cl
was predicted by birthweight and serum creatinine ( cr ) on day of life 2 as defined by the following equation : 
 cl(l / h)=0.111(birthweight3.3kg)0.75(1cr , mg / dl)0.566 the inter - individual variability of cl followed an exponential error model with a coefficient of variation of 16.1% . utilizing each neonate s birthweight , serum creatinine , and gentamicin dosing and concentration history , individual empirical bayesian estimates of cl
the estimated gentamicin clearance was then scaled using the allometric 3/4 power model to a 70 kg adult(11 ) and log - transformed before comparison by student s t - test .
all statistical analyses were performed using r ( version 2.12.0 ; r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) .
continuous data are reported as mean  sd , and categorical data are reported as counts ( % ) .

thirty - four neonates with hie receiving therapeutic hypothermia in the q24 period and 27 neonates with hie receiving therapeutic hypothermia in the q36h period had gentamicin concentration data available .
five neonates were excluded from the q24h period : three required ecmo , one was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy , and one had incomplete dose records .
four neonates were excluded from the q36h period : one required ecmo , two had incomplete dose records , and one had only a random drug level .
therefore , a total of 29 neonates in the q24h period and 23 neonates in the q36h period were evaluated .
eighteen ( 62% ) neonates in the q24h period and twenty ( 87% ) neonates in the q36h period had peak concentrations .
neonates were generally comparable between the two treatment periods ; however , neonates in the q24h period had a slightly lower gestational age , lower 5-minute apgar , higher base deficit , and higher mortality rate ( table 1 ) .
five neonates died after redirection of care for severe brain injury that was detected by neurologic exam and confirmed with eeg and/or head ultrasound and mri .
one neonate died after redirection of care for moderate - severe brain injury and severe end - organ dysfunction represented by persistent coagulopathy requiring ongoing transfusions , elevated liver enzymes , and acute renal failure .
there were no differences in birthweight and serum creatinine between treatment periods - two major predictors of gentamicin clearance .
the mean gentamicin dose was 4.9  0.3 mg / kg every 24 hours and 5.0  0.1 mg / kg every 36 hours during the q24h and q36h period , respectively .
the time of initial gentamicin drug level measurement increased from 2.2  1.1 days in the q24 period to 3.2  0.9 days in the q36 period ( p=0.001 ) .
this increase coincides with the difference in timing of a 3rd gentamicin dose using an every 24h versus an every 36h regimen .
gentamicin peak and trough concentrations achieved during both treatment periods are shown in figure 1 .
the mean trough concentration decreased from 2.0  0.8 mg / l in the q24h period to 0.9  0.4 mg / l in the q36h period ( p<0.001 ) .
the percentage of neonates with an elevated trough concentration > 2 mg / l decreased from 38% ( 11 of 29 ) to 4% ( 1 of 23 ) with implementation of a q36h dosing interval ( p<0.007 ) .
there was a trend toward lower peak concentrations ( q24h 11.4  2.3 mg / l vs. q36h 10.0  1.9 mg /
gentamicin clearance was similar in both treatment periods ( q24h 1.17  0.24 l / h/70 kg vs. q36h 1.15  0.19 l / h/70 kg ; p=0.9 ) .
serum creatinine on the second day of life correlated with trough concentration ( q24h r = 0.54 ; q36h r = 0.14 ) and gentamicin clearance ( combined r = 0.48 ) ( figure 2 ) . during the q24 period , 4 of the 6 neonates who ultimately died
had an elevated trough concentration > 2 mg / l ; the serum creatinine was 1.2 mg / dl in three of these four neonates .
in the two neonates who died but had a normal trough concentration , the serum creatinine was  0.9 mg / dl on the second day of life .
the one neonate who did not achieve target trough concentration in the q36h period had a serum creatinine of 1.3 mg / dl on the second day of life .
this study examined the impact of implementing a new empiric gentamicin dose of 5 mg / kg every 36h on drug concentrations in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia .
the major study finding was that every 36h dosing significantly improved achievement of target trough concentration with 96% achieving a concentration < 2 mg / l . in addition , high peak concentrations were still maintained with this dosing strategy .
neonates with hie are a critically ill population often with multi - organ system morbidity.(3,4 ) therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours is an effective treatment modality in neonates with moderate to severe hie(12 ) and is now the standard of care.(6 ) as the treatment for neonates with hie evolves and specialized neonatal neurocritical care models are developed,(13 ) understanding the therapeutic use of drugs in this population and their unique clinical pharmacologic needs will be essential .
gentamicin is a common antibiotic used in neonates to treat suspected sepsis.(14 ) a standard dose of 45 mg / kg every 24h regularly achieves target drug concentrations in full - term neonates.(15 ) however , a previous clinical study in neonates with hie showed a high rate of elevated trough concentrations > 2 mg / l for both hypothermic and normothermic subjects when this standard dose was used.(8 ) to help develop a customized gentamicin dose strategy for neonates with hie receiving hypothermia , we previously evaluated gentamicin pharmacokinetics.(9 ) gentamicin clearance was reduced in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia , and birthweight and serum creatinine were significant predictors of gentamicin clearance .
monte carlo simulations predicted a gentamicin dose of 5 mg / kg every 36h would achieve trough concentrations < 2 mg / l in 90% of neonates .
post - implementation of this gentamicin dose , achievement of target trough concentrations in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia was similar to the model predictions .
in addition , this dosing strategy still benefits from higher peak concentrations associated with extended interval aminoglycoside dosing that are desirable given the concentration - dependent killing of gentamicin.(16 ) while larger , multi - center studies would provide further validation , the current evidence supports an empiric gentamicin dose of 5 mg / kg every 36h in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia to achieve trough concentrations < 2 mg / l .
gentamicin is eliminated from the body by glomerular filtration,(17 ) and gentamicin clearance was lower in neonates with reduced kidney function as measured by serum creatinine on dol 2 ( figure 2 ) .
this is in agreement with previous pharmacokinetic studies in neonates,(1820 ) however the relationship between serum creatinine and gentamicin clearance in neonates has been inconsistent.(21 ) this inconsistency is likely due to the confounding of serum creatinine in the first 24 to 48 hours after birth with maternal kidney function due placental transfer .
but , neonates with hie who develop acute kidney injury have been documented to have elevation in serum creatinine as soon as dol 1,(22 ) which could explain its predictive ability found in our study . however , even for a given serum creatinine interpatient variation in gentamicin clearance remained .
therefore , tdm at the 3rd gentamicin dose is still necessary to help guide more long - term dosing . due to the poor sensitivity of serum creatinine in detecting mild and moderate acute kidney injury,(23 )
newer urinary biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( ngal ) that are potentially more sensitive and specific predictors of acute kidney injury warrant further study in the hie population.(2426 ) we focused on gentamicin dosing in the context of hypothermia since all neonates with hie in our study were cooled .
animal studies have shown a decrease in gentamicin clearance during severe ( 29c)(27 ) but not moderate ( 35c ) hypothermia.(28 ) a previous clinical study reported similar gentamicin trough concentrations in normothermic and hypothermic ( 33.5c ) neonates.(8 ) a similar lack of effect of hypothermia on drug clearance in neonates with hie has been reported for phenobarbital , a drug primarily dependent upon hepatic metabolism.(29,30 ) however , the power to detect small to modest effects of hypothermia on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was likely low given study design limitations inherent to the hie population , including small sample size , limited concentration sampling , concomitant medications , and large variation in pathophysiology . in addition , an already reduced drug clearance in neonates with hie(31 ) likely makes the detection of further alterations from hypothermia challenging .
hypothermia is now standard of care in neonates with hie,(6 ) and this creates a complexity moving forward in studying the specific effect of hypothermia on drug pharmacokinetics .
whether future studies will be able to adequately address the hypothermic effect on drug pharmacokinetics in neonates is unclear .
nonetheless , understanding drug pharmacokinetics and drug dose needs in neonates with hie while receiving hypothermia is still valuable clinically .
the institution s cooling protocol criteria did not differ between treatment periods and therefore provided some consistency in population selection . nonetheless , a few measured patient characteristics that could indicate a sicker population were different ( see table 1 ) .
most evident , death was more common in the q24 period ( 6 of 29 ) versus the q36h period ( 0 of 23 ) . however , death was due to redirection of care for brain injury and not end - organ dysfunction in all but one neonate .
in addition , the similarity in birthweight and serum creatinine between treatment periods was reassuring since these were found to be two predictors of gentamicin clearance in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia,(9 ) and the calculated gentamicin clearance was the same between treatment periods . since gentamicin clearance is the fundamental pharmacokinetic parameter influencing trough concentrations ,
the neonates were comparable from a pharmacologic perspective . furthermore , in the neonates who ultimately died , the serum creatinine was still helpful in predicting gentamicin clearance and helped differentiate the patients from a pharmacologic perspective .
further limitations to the study include the retrospective design , small sample size and the availability of a convenience sample of drug level data collected as part of routine care . additionally , the study lacked power to directly evaluate the impact of the dose change on clinical outcomes , including treatment effectiveness or toxicity .
every 36h and 48h dosing intervals have previously been described for other neonatal populations with reduced gentamicin clearance such as the preterm neonate.(32,33 )
compared to a 5 mg / kg every 24h dose , an empiric gentamicin dose of 5 mg / kg every 36h improved achievement of trough concentrations < 2 mg / l in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia . due to the variation and frequent acute kidney injury in neonates with hie , routine tdm is recommended to help guide dosing .
focused clinical pharmacology studies for other medications commonly used in neonates with hie receiving hypothermia are warranted .","INTRODUCTION

"data were drawn from the whitehall ii cohort , established in 1985 as a longitudinal study among 10,308 ( 6,895 male and 3,413 female ) u.k .
all civil servants aged 3555 years in 20 london - based departments were invited to participate by letter ; 73% agreed . the baseline examination
( phase 1 ) took place from 1985 to 1988 and involved a clinical examination and a self - administered questionnaire .
subsequent phases of data collection alternated between postal questionnaire alone ( phases 2 [ 19881990 ] , 4 [ 19951996 ] , 6 , and 8 ) and postal questionnaire accompanied by a clinical examination ( phases 3 [ 19911993 ] , 5 [ 19971999 ] , 7 [ 20022004 ] and 9 [ 20072009 ] ) .
data on metabolic factors for the current study were drawn from phase 3 , considered the  baseline  for the purpose of these analyses .
all participants provided written consent and the university college of london ethics committee approved the study . with the patients in only underwear , weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on digital soehnle electronic scales ( leifheit as , nassau , germany ) . with the participant standing
erect in bare feet with the head in the frankfurt plane , height was measured to the nearest 1 mm using a stadiometer .
reproducibility of measurements over 1 month ( correlation coefficient = between - subject variability/[total between + within subject variability ] ) , undertaken for 331 participants , was 0.99 for both weight and height .
bmi was calculated by dividing weight ( in kilograms ) by height ( in meters squared ) and categorized using the world health organization classification ( 23 ) : underweight , < 18.5 kg / m ; standard weight , 18.524.9 kg / m ; overweight , 2529.9 kg / m ; and obese , 30 kg / m , with the < 18.5 category ( n = 80 ) removed from the analysis .
blood pressure was measured twice in the sitting position after 5 min of rest with a hawksley random - zero sphygmomanometer ( lynjay services ltd , worthing , u.k . ) .
venous blood was taken in the fasting state or at least 5 h after a light , fat - free breakfast before undergoing a 2-h , 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) .
serum for lipid analyses was refrigerated at 4c and assayed within 72 h. hdl - cholesterol ( hdl - c ) was measured by precipitating non - hdl - c with dextran sulfate  magnesium chloride using a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant .
serum triglyceride was determined by enzymatic colorimetric method ( glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase / phenol and aminophenazone [ gpo - pap ] ) .
the concentration of ldl - cholesterol ( ldl - c ) was calculated using the friedewald formula when serum triglycerides were lower than 4.5
blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method ( 24 ) ( ysi model 2300 stat plus analyzer ; ysi corporation , yellow springs , oh ) ( mean coefficient of variation , 2.93.3% ) . insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay using polyclonal guinea pig antiserum at age 49 years and by double antibody enzyme - linked immunosorbant assay at age 61 years
. homeostasis model assessment ( homa ) of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) calculation was based on model - derived estimates ( rather than linear approximations ) using the homa2 calculator version 2.2 ( http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/index.php?maindoc=/homa/index.php , diabetes trials unit , university of oxford , oxford , u.k . )
c - reactive protein ( crp ) was measured in serum stored at 80c using a high - sensitivity immunonephelometric assay in a bn prospec nephelometer ( dade behring , deerfield , il ) .
names of medications as provided by the participants were coded using the british national formulary to identify antihypertensive and lipid - lowering drugs and medication for diabetes .
we used five definitions to cross - classify individuals : the adult treatment panel - iii ( atp - iii ) definition of metabolic syndrome ( 27 ) , wildman criterion ( 12 ) , karelis criterion ( 28 ) , the ogtt derived from the matsuda index ( 13,29 ) and the homa index ( 11 ) ( supplementary table 1 ) . the atp - iii definition ( 27 ) of metabolic normality required individuals to have one or none of the following components ( waist circumference criterion was not used because of collinearity with bmi ) : triglycerides 1.7 mmol / l or use of lipid - lowering drugs , systolic blood pressure 130 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure  85 mmhg or use of antihypertensive drugs , glucose 5.6 mmol / l or use of medications for diabetes , and hdl - c
participants were considered metabolically healthy by wildman criterion ( 12 ) if they had one or none of the following components : blood pressure 130/85 mmhg or use of antihypertensive drugs , triglycerides 1.7 mmol / l or use of lipid - lowering drugs , fasting glucose 5.6 mmol / l or use of medications for diabetes , homa - ir above the 90th percentile among all participants , crp above the 90th percentile among all participants , and hdl - c
karelis criterion ( 28 ) required metabolically healthy subjects to have 4 of 5 of the following components : triglycerides 1.7 mmol / l or use of lipid - lowering drugs , hdl - c 1.3 mmol / l , ldl - c 2.6 mmol / l , homa 2.7 , and crp 3.0
was calculated as follows : mean glucose and mean insulin were obtained using the average glucose and insulin levels , respectively , from the ogtt .
the matsuda index was divided into quartiles , and subjects were classified as metabolically healthy if they belonged to the upper quartile of this index ( 186.16 for men and 157.68 for women ) .
the homa index ( 11 ) was divided into quartiles , and participants were classified as metabolically healthy if they belonged to the three lower quartiles ( 1.70 for men and 1.52 for women ) of this index .
we used these definitions alongside data on bmi to create six phenotypes : metabolically healthy , normal weight ( mh - nw ) ; metabolically healthy overweight ; mho ; metabolically abnormal , normal weight ; metabolically abnormal overweight ; and metabolically abnormal obese ( mao ) .
sociodemographic covariates included age , sex , occupational position , ethnicity ( white vs. nonwhite ) , and marital status ( single , married / cohabiting , divorced , widowed ) .
occupational position is a three - level variable representing high ( administrative ) , intermediate ( professional or executive ) , and low ( clerical or support ) grades .
this measure is a comprehensive marker of socioeconomic circumstances and is related to salary , social status , and level of responsibility at work ( 22 ) .
behavioral measures included smoking status ( never , current , or ex - smoker ) ; alcohol intake ( assessed via questions about the number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the past 7 days and categorized as no alcohol [ none or < 1 unit / week ] , moderate drinker [ 114 units / week for women and 121 units / week for men ] , heavy drinker [ > 14 units for women and > 21 units for men ] ) ; physical activity ( categorized as active [ 2.5 h / week of moderate or 1 h / week of vigorous physical activity ] , inactive [ < 1 h / week of moderate and < 1 h / week of vigorous physical activity ] , or moderately active [ not active or inactive ] ) ; and consumption of fruits and vegetables ( assessed using the question ,  how often do you eat fresh fruits or vegetables ?  ; responses were given on a two - point scale : 1 fruit or vegetable / day , or < 1 fruit or vegetable / day ) .
missing data on covariates during phase 3 ( 19911993 ; < 1% ) were replaced with data from the phase immediately before or after that phase .
study members are linked to the national health services death and electronic patient records with the use of a national health services identification number .
a total of 10,297 participants ( 99.9% ) were traced successfully and have been followed through these registers .
mortality data , which included the cause of death , were available through the national health services central registry until 31 january 2010 .
the characteristics of the sample are presented as mean  sd or percentage , as appropriate , by bmi category and for the obese as a function of metabolic health using the atp - iii definition .
we used anova to test for differences in baseline characteristics between groups for continuous variables and the  test for dichotomous measures .
cox proportional - hazard regression models with follow - up period as the time scale were used to examine the relationship between bmi category / metabolic phenotypes ( using the five definitions mentioned earlier ) and mortality .
the interaction term between ethnicity and bmi / metabolic status phenotypes suggested no differences across ethnic groups ( p for interaction 0.10 and 0.56 ) .
similarly , the interaction term for sex revealed no differences between men and women ( p for interaction 0.11 and 0.59 ) . this allowed us to combine ethnic groups and men and women in the analysis . in the first set of analyses
hazard ratios ( hrs ) and 95% cis were adjusted sequentially for age and sex ( data not shown ) and then adjusted further for occupational position , ethnicity , marital status , smoking status , alcohol intake , physical activity , and fruit and vegetable consumption .
we then ran a second set of analyses , stratified by bmi category , to allow us to compare the risk of mortality as a function of metabolic health status in each strata of bmi .
both sets of analyses were repeated with cvd mortality as the outcome . in sensitivity analyses we repeated the analyses after replacing occupational position with education and excluding all deaths that occurred in the first 5 years of follow - up to take into account possible effects of reverse causation as an explanation of our findings .
we also replicated analyses using absolute rates of mortality and finally using non - cvd mortality as an outcome .
data were drawn from the whitehall ii cohort , established in 1985 as a longitudinal study among 10,308 ( 6,895 male and 3,413 female ) u.k .
all civil servants aged 3555 years in 20 london - based departments were invited to participate by letter ; 73% agreed . the baseline examination
( phase 1 ) took place from 1985 to 1988 and involved a clinical examination and a self - administered questionnaire .
subsequent phases of data collection alternated between postal questionnaire alone ( phases 2 [ 19881990 ] , 4 [ 19951996 ] , 6 , and 8 ) and postal questionnaire accompanied by a clinical examination ( phases 3 [ 19911993 ] , 5 [ 19971999 ] , 7 [ 20022004 ] and 9 [ 20072009 ] ) .
data on metabolic factors for the current study were drawn from phase 3 , considered the  baseline  for the purpose of these analyses .
all participants provided written consent and the university college of london ethics committee approved the study .
with the patients in only underwear , weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on digital soehnle electronic scales ( leifheit as , nassau , germany ) . with the participant standing
erect in bare feet with the head in the frankfurt plane , height was measured to the nearest 1 mm using a stadiometer .
reproducibility of measurements over 1 month ( correlation coefficient = between - subject variability/[total between + within subject variability ] ) , undertaken for 331 participants , was 0.99 for both weight and height .
bmi was calculated by dividing weight ( in kilograms ) by height ( in meters squared ) and categorized using the world health organization classification ( 23 ) : underweight , < 18.5 kg / m ; standard weight , 18.524.9 kg / m ; overweight , 2529.9 kg / m ; and obese , 30 kg / m , with the < 18.5 category ( n = 80 ) removed from the analysis .
blood pressure was measured twice in the sitting position after 5 min of rest with a hawksley random - zero sphygmomanometer ( lynjay services ltd , worthing , u.k . ) .
venous blood was taken in the fasting state or at least 5 h after a light , fat - free breakfast before undergoing a 2-h , 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) .
serum for lipid analyses was refrigerated at 4c and assayed within 72 h. hdl - cholesterol ( hdl - c ) was measured by precipitating non - hdl - c with dextran sulfate  magnesium chloride using a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant .
serum triglyceride was determined by enzymatic colorimetric method ( glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase / phenol and aminophenazone [ gpo - pap ] ) .
the concentration of ldl - cholesterol ( ldl - c ) was calculated using the friedewald formula when serum triglycerides were lower than 4.5 mmol / l .

insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay using polyclonal guinea pig antiserum at age 49 years and by double antibody enzyme - linked immunosorbant assay at age 61 years
. homeostasis model assessment ( homa ) of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) calculation was based on model - derived estimates ( rather than linear approximations ) using the homa2 calculator version 2.2 ( http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/index.php?maindoc=/homa/index.php , diabetes trials unit , university of oxford , oxford , u.k . )
c - reactive protein ( crp ) was measured in serum stored at 80c using a high - sensitivity immunonephelometric assay in a bn prospec nephelometer ( dade behring , deerfield , il ) .
names of medications as provided by the participants were coded using the british national formulary to identify antihypertensive and lipid - lowering drugs and medication for diabetes .
we used five definitions to cross - classify individuals : the adult treatment panel - iii ( atp - iii ) definition of metabolic syndrome ( 27 ) , wildman criterion ( 12 ) , karelis criterion ( 28 ) , the ogtt derived from the matsuda index ( 13,29 ) and the homa index ( 11 ) ( supplementary table 1 ) . the atp - iii definition ( 27 ) of metabolic normality required individuals to have one or none of the following components ( waist circumference criterion was not used because of collinearity with bmi ) : triglycerides 1.7 mmol / l or use of lipid - lowering drugs , systolic blood pressure 130 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure  85 mmhg or use of antihypertensive drugs , glucose 5.6 mmol / l or use of medications for diabetes , and hdl - c
participants were considered metabolically healthy by wildman criterion ( 12 ) if they had one or none of the following components : blood pressure 130/85 mmhg or use of antihypertensive drugs , triglycerides 1.7 mmol / l or use of lipid - lowering drugs , fasting glucose 5.6 mmol / l or use of medications for diabetes , homa - ir above the 90th percentile among all participants , crp above the 90th percentile among all participants , and hdl - c
karelis criterion ( 28 ) required metabolically healthy subjects to have 4 of 5 of the following components : triglycerides 1.7
mmol / l , ldl - c 2.6 mmol / l , homa 2.7 , and crp 3.0
was calculated as follows : mean glucose and mean insulin were obtained using the average glucose and insulin levels , respectively , from the ogtt .
the matsuda index was divided into quartiles , and subjects were classified as metabolically healthy if they belonged to the upper quartile of this index ( 186.16 for men and 157.68 for women ) . the homa index ( 11 )
was divided into quartiles , and participants were classified as metabolically healthy if they belonged to the three lower quartiles ( 1.70 for men and 1.52 for women ) of this index .
we used these definitions alongside data on bmi to create six phenotypes : metabolically healthy , normal weight ( mh - nw ) ; metabolically healthy overweight ; mho ; metabolically abnormal , normal weight ; metabolically abnormal overweight ; and metabolically abnormal obese ( mao ) .

a total of 8,223 participants attended the clinical examination at baseline , when bmi and metabolic factors were assessed ; 5,269 of these individuals had data on all the components necessary for analysis of body size phenotypes .
the participants included in the analytic sample ( n = 5,269 ) compared with those who were excluded were more likely to be men ( 71.7% vs. 64.9% ;
p < 0.001 ) , obese ( 12.1% vs. 5.4% ; p < 0.001 ) , and married or cohabiting ( 77.5% vs. 75.2% ; p = 0.001 ) .
they were less likely to be current smokers ( 12.3% vs. 16.1% ; p < 0.001 ) and to have a higher occupational position ( 37.4% vs. 39.9% ; p = 0.003 ) .
although these differences were statistically significant because of the large sample size , the absolute differences were small in general .
a total of 44.8% of the participants were normal weight , 43.1% were overweight , and 12.1% were obese .
triglycerides , fasting glucose , 2-h glucose level , fasting insulin , blood pressure , crp , and homa - ir were higher in mao than in mho participants ( p < 0.001 for all these components ) , whereas hdl - c was higher in mho than in mao participants using the atp - iii definition .
sample characteristics at baseline ( 19911993 ) as a function of bmi supplementary table 2 shows the prevalence of the six phenotypes created using the five definitions . among obese participants , 236 ( 37.% ) were classified as metabolically healthy by the atp - iii definition ( 27 ) , 146 ( 22.9% ) by the wildman criteria ( 12 ) , 119 ( 18.7% ) by the karelis criteria ( 28 ) , 57 ( 9.0% ) by the matsuda index ( 13,29 ) and 260 ( 40.8% ) using the homa index ( 11 ) . in the entire analytic sample , using the various definitions , the prevalences of the mho phenotype are 4.5% ( atp - iii ) , 2.8% ( wildman ) , 2.3% ( karelis ) , 1.1% ( matsuda ) , and 4.9% ( homa ) . during the median follow - up of 17.7 years
, 413 deaths occurred ( 7.8% of the total population ) : 76 deaths ( 11.9% ) were among obese , 175 ( 7.7% ) among overweight , and 162 ( 6.9% ) among normal - weight participants . among the 126 cvd deaths , 44 ( 34.9% ) were among normal - weight individuals , 58 ( 46.0% ) among overweight , and 24 ( 19.1% ) among obese individuals .
table 2 shows the associations of bmi categories and metabolic health factors with all - cause and cvd mortality .
compared with normal - weight individuals , the obese ( hr 1.68 [ 95% ci 1.272.22 ] ) but not the overweight ( 1.01 [ 0.821.26 ] ) had an increased risk of mortality . all atp - iii ( 27 ) components and all components of the wildman criterion ( 12 ) , the homa index ( 11 ) , and crp as defined by karelis ( 28 ) were associated with an increased risk of mortality , whereas the matsuda index ( 13,29 ) , ldl - c , and homa as defined by karelis ( 28 ) were not .
the association of individual risk factors used to define metabolic health with all - cause and cvd mortality table 3 depicts the associations between the six bmi / metabolic categories and all - cause and cvd mortality with the mh - nw group as the reference .
the mho group did not have an increased risk of all - cause and cvd mortality , whatever the definition of metabolic health , but the mho group had a greater risk of death ( all - cause mortality ) for all definitions except for the homa index ( hr 1.08 [ 95% ci 0.671.74 ] ) . the mortality hazard in the mao group was higher compared with the mh - nw group , whatever the definition of metabolic abnormality .
analyses using absolute rates , using deaths per 1,000 person - years ( supplementary table 3 ) , excluding deaths in the first 5 years ( n = 63 ) of follow - up ( supplementary table 4 ) , using non - cvd mortality as an outcome ( supplementary table 5 ) , and adding menopausal status as a covariate ( data not shown ) yielded similar results to those reported in table 3 . the association of bmi / metabolic health status with all - cause and cvd mortality figure 1 and supplementary fig .

this study assessed the association of five different definitions of the mho phenotype with all - cause and cvd mortality .
our results show that 941% of the obese population qualify as being metabolically healthy , depending on the method used to ascertain metabolic health . in relation to four of the five definitions ,
both mho and mao participants had an elevated risk of mortality compared with mh - nw individuals .
the metabolically healthy overweight individuals were not at increased risk of mortality regardless of the methods used ; however , this was not the case for the metabolically abnormal overweight individuals .
our results show that obese individuals , irrespective of their metabolic status , carry an excess risk of mortality .
direct comparison of our results with other studies is made difficult by the use of a different reference group to assess risk ( 18 ) ; often the reference group combines the normal and overweight individuals or uses a different definition of metabolic health status ( 21 ) .
no previous study has compared a range of definitions of metabolic status within the sample analytic framework .
( 20 ) , using the national cholesterol education program criteria , and kuk and ardern ( 21 ) , using insulin resistance by homa and the metsyn criteria , also found an increased risk for all - cause mortality when comparing mho to mh - nw individuals . however , calori et al .
( 19 ) , who estimated insulin resistance suing homa ( insulin sensitive < 2.5 ; insulin resistant 2.5 ) , and hamer and stamatakis ( 18 ) , who used a definition based on blood pressure , hdl - c , diabetes diagnosis , waist circumference , and low - grade inflammation , did not find greater risk of all - cause and cvd mortality in mho compared with metabolically healthy nonobese individuals . in our study the mho group did not carry excess risk of mortality compared with the mh - nw group only when using the homa index ( 11 ) to assess metabolic status .
this implies that four of the five definitions used in this article show the risk of mortality in mho individuals to be higher than mh - nw and similar to mao individuals .
the homa index is a measure of pancreatic -cell function , whereas the matsuda index is a composite measure of hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity .
our results suggest that the homa index might be particularly useful in distinguishing obese individuals at a greater risk of mortality .
we used a range of methods , based on insulin resistance and clustering of metabolic abnormalities , to better understand the mho phenotype .
the five methods did not identify the same subgroups of individuals ; only 23 subjects ( 3.6% ) among the obese are classified as mho using all five definitions .
taking the results obtained for the obese and the overweight phenotypes , our results suggest that criteria for metabolic health status using established cut - offs like those in the atp - iii criterion ( 27 ) are more reasonable because the threshold for risk has been validated on multiple occasions .
however , criteria that are based on risk distribution ( percentile ) , as the matsuda ( 13,29 ) or homa indices ( 11 ) , lead to less consistent results across studies .
this is principally because the distribution of risk is likely to vary among different populations ( obese , clinical , as a function of age , or even in the general population ) , and a threshold such as the top quartile may not translate well across populations . to examine obesity phenotypes we constructed six groups : metabolically healthy or metabolically abnormal normal weight , metabolically healthy or metabolically abnormal overweight , and metabolically healthy or metabolically abnormal obese , as has been done previously ( 20,21 ) .
this is in contrast to other studies that used only four groups : nonobese metabolically healthy or unhealthy and obese metabolically healthy or unhealthy ( 18,19 ) , making the assumption that normal weight and overweight individuals have the same risk .
we preferred to test this assumption and , as the results show , there is little difference between the normal weight and overweight groups .
so , for mortality risk , the analyses could have been based on four categories of bmi / metabolic health phenotypes . in analyses comparing individuals within the same bmi category and using the metabolically healthy as the reference group
, we found that in normal and overweight groups metabolic abnormality carried some excess risk when the criteria for metabolic health were atp - iii ( 27 ) , wildman ( 12 ) , or karelis ( 28 ) , but no excess risk was observed for the matsuda ( 13,29 ) or the homa indices ( 11 ) . in the obese group , the risk of mortality did not differ as a function of metabolic health except for that based on the homa index ( 11 ) .
these results can be understood in light of results showing a favorable metabolic profile for a range of measures when the homa index was used to identify mho individuals ( 15 ) .
the study in question compared different methods ( hyperinsulinemic - euglycemic clamp , matsuda index , homa index , karelis and wildman criteria ) to identify mho individuals ; those identified using the homa index had lower levels of bmi , central fat mass , fasting glucose , and insulin .
this suggests that the homa index might be a more efficient measure of health status in the obese population .
given the obesity epidemic , a better understanding of the extent to which the mho phenotype carries risks for health is important . identifying mechanisms of this favorable metabolic profile would improve the treatment of obese patients to reduce cardiometabolic risk ( 16 ) .
it has been suggested that adipose cell size could be a link between obesity and insulin resistance . comparing the size of adipose cells between mho and mao individuals , mclaughlin et al .
( 30 ) found that the mao group had a higher proportion of small adipose cells , which were seen to have adverse effects , compared with mho individuals .
meigs et al . ( 11 ) reported that mho individuals also had a lower amount of visceral fat content .
there is some evidence to suggest that mho people might be less responsive to lifestyle interventions for improvement of insulin sensitivity ( 31,32 ) , but these findings are based on small - scale studies .
our findings and those of several other studies ( 20,21 ) suggest that the adverse effects of obesity on survival can not be eliminated by targeting only metabolic health .
the main strengths of this study include the large sample size and the nearly 18-year follow - up for mortality .
furthermore , to our knowledge , this is the first study that evaluated the risk of all - cause and cvd mortality associated with bmi / metabolic phenotypes using five different definitions to identify the mho phenotype that have been published .
we adjusted for several covariates , including occupational position , ethnic group , alcohol consumption , marital status , physical activity , smoking , and dietary behavior , which allowed us to minimize the potential for confounding by these factors .
the most important limitation of the study is that participants of the whitehall ii study are mainly office - based civil servants and are not fully representative of the british population because the study does not include unemployed or individuals in  blue - collar  professions .
however , they cover a wide socioeconomic range , with > 10-fold difference between the highest and lowest salaries .
another limitation is the lack of ethnic diversity in the study sample , although tests suggested no heterogeneity in associations as a function of ethnicity , which could be due to the limited sample size of racial / ethnic minorities .
we were unable to assess the change in metabolic status during the follow - up period ; it is possible that some participants who were healthy at baseline developed metabolic risk factors .
our study focuses on mortality as an outcome , but findings for morbidity are mixed .
one study showed mho to have a cardiovascular risk profile between that of healthy nonobese and mao ( 33 ) . a longitudinal study ( 11 ) showed that the mho phenotype was associated with a reduced risk of developing cvd , whereas others studies have shown that obese individuals without metabolic syndrome had an increased risk for cardiovascular events ( 20 ) .
further large - scale studies are required to assess the impact of the mho phenotype on morbidity related to obesity for example , cvd , cancers , respiratory diseases , and depression . in summary ,
our data suggest that the mho phenotype exists even though there are large variations in prevalence rates as a function of criteria used to define this phenotype .
however , mho individuals do not seem to be at a lower risk for all - cause and cvd mortality compared with mh - nw individuals  in effect their risk of mortality was similar to that of the mao group .
this risk was independent of the definition used except for the homa index , for which mho did not carry excess risk .
our analyses suggest that thresholds to define metabolic health elaborated on the basis of the distribution of the risk factor may not be useful because they can not be generalized across populations .","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

"many of the chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases , type-2 diabetes , some types of cancer , overweight and/or obesity , depression , etc . , which we are faced with today are caused by an increase in sedentary behaviors and poor nutritional intake .
currently , only about 32% of the population is meeting physical activity recommendations set forth by the american college of sports medicine ( acsm ) and american heart association ( aha ) : moderate - intensity physical activity for 30-minutes per day for at least five days per week or vigorous - intensity physical activity for 20-minutes per day for at least three days per week ( 11 ) . furthermore , an increasing number of employees are not meeting these recommendations due to the nature of their jobs .
a report done in 2006 found that 3.2 million workers were sitting still while 2.6 million workers were standing still for the duration of their work day ( 14 ) . besides an increase in sedentary behaviors , or physical inactivity , poor nutritional intake characterized by high energy intake and over - consumption of saturated fat
, cholesterol , sugar , and salt is a major culprit contributing to the number of individuals being diagnosed with chronic diseases ( 6 ) . aside from these unhealthy behaviors ( physical inactivity and poor nutritional intake ) ,
the majority of individuals in the workforce , more specifically at a university setting , are 25 years or older ( 14 ) .
this sets the stage for sarcopenia , which is defined as the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass ( 0.51% loss per year after the age of 25 ) , quality , and strength associated with aging ( 1 ) .
this degenerative loss of muscle mass may negatively affect other health - related variables such as flexibility and balance ( 1 ) . to combat sarcopenia acsm recommendations for strength training include : 810 exercises , 13 sets , 812 repetitions at least twice a week ( 1 ) .
physical inactivity combined with poor nutritional intake over time will lead to the development of overweight and obesity with a subsequent increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases ( 14 ) .
sedentary behaviors are one of the leading preventable causes of death in the united states , with an inverse linear dose - response relationship between volume of physical activity and mortality associated with chronic diseases ( 8) .
regular physical activity participation has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases ( 8) . maintaining a healthy diet , such as low saturated fat intake combined with high fruit and vegetable intake , has been found to be important in the prevention of overweight and obesity , and ultimately the development of chronic diseases ( 15 ) .
maintaining energy balance ( energy intake versus expenditure ) is an increasing problem among workers .
this increase in energy intake and subsequent decrease in expenditure can mostly be attributed to such things as the type of work ( office work ) , inflexible work hours , and easy access to fast food and unhealthy snacks .
once again , these factors workers are faced with can lead to the development of chronic diseases .
furthermore , since most adults spend approximately half of their waking hours at the workplace , the worksite is believed to provide good opportunities for fostering the development of healthy behaviors .
more specifically , worksite health promotion programs can be defined as employer initiatives directed at improving the health and well - being of workers ( 7 ) .
maes and colleagues ( 9 ) incorporated half - hour intervention sessions three times per week for three years . the intervention consisted of physical exercise and health education .
physical exercise sessions were chosen by the participants and consisted of walking , step aerobics , and body weight exercises .
health education sessions focused on nutrition , alcohol and drug consumption , working conditions and stress , smoking behavior , headaches , and back pain .
results from maes and colleagues ( 9 ) demonstrated that an intervention consisting of both physical exercise and health education has the potential to produce extensive and stable effects on health - related variables .
shephard ( 13 ) implemented a similar design with half - hour exercise sessions that met three times per week over the course of a three month period .
results demonstrated small but favorable changes in body mass , skinfolds , aerobic power , muscle strength and flexibility , overall risk - taking behavior , systemic blood pressure , serum cholesterol , and cigarette smoking after implementing a worksite fitness and exercise program ( 13 ) .
carter and colleagues ( 4 ) implemented a stability ball training program that was performed twice per week for 10-weeks .
results demonstrated improvements in muscular strength and endurance , which provided benefits for individuals who spent a considerable amount of time sitting throughout the day ( 4 ) .
eddy and colleagues ( 5 ) found improvements in low - back flexibility , abdominal strength , upper - body strength , weight loss , and diastolic blood pressure after having participants complete a health and fitness program structured primarily around physical activity ( 5 ) . according to proper and colleagues ( 12 ) inconclusive evidence exists for the effect of physical activity programs at worksites on health - related variables .
inconsistent results largely due to variations in definition and assessment of the outcomes or to the compliance with the program led proper and colleagues ( 12 ) to this conclusion .
previous research has demonstrated that both short- and long - term duration worksite fitness programs can have positive effects on a multitude of health - related variables . to the best of our knowledge
there are no studies that have examined the impact of a faculty and staff exercise program that includes a variety of intensity - related ( moderate- to high - intensity ) classes .
therefore , the impact from participation in a variety of intensity - related classes on faculty and staff at a university setting is unknown .
for that reason , it is necessary to examine the potential impact that participation in these classes may have on several health - related variables .
the purpose of this research study was to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week exercise program designed for the faculty and staff at a large , public , american university with specific aims at improving body mass , muscular strength and endurance , flexibility , and balance .
it was hypothesized that after the completion of a 12-week exercise program participants would have improvements in body weight , muscular strength and endurance , flexibility , and balance .
fifty - seven faculty and staff ( n = 51 females , n = 6 males , average age 48  10 years and weight 91.8  24.3 kg , table 1 ) participated in this 12-week exercise program .
participants were excluded if they did not receive clearance from their primary physician beforehand for such issues as orthopedic injuries , cardiovascular disorder , etc .
prior to participation faculty and staff were instructed on the benefits and risks of the exercise program and signed informed consent and medical history forms .
faculty and staff reported to the exercise physiology laboratory on day one and the last day of the exercise program to be assessed in body mass , balance , flexibility , muscular strength and endurance .
faculty and staff were measured for weight by using a balance beam scale ( health o meter , chicago , il ) . during the assessment of balance on the biodex balance system ( biodex medical systems inc . ,
participants were instructed to balance on their dominant leg with shoes on and eyes open for three sets of 20- seconds each .
flexibility was assessed by using the sit - and - reach test ( 2 ) ( figure finder flex - tester , novel products inc . ,
participants were instructed to remove their shoes and assume a sitting position with knees extended and feet and heels flat against the box .
next , participants extended their arms straight forward with hands placed on top of each other and fingers even .
muscular strength and endurance were assessed by utilizing the american college of sports medicine ( acsm ) guidelines ( 2 ) for the push - up and one - minute curl - up tests . for the push - up test ( 2 ) males started in the standard 
down  position ( hands pointing forward and under the shoulders , back straight , head up , using the toes as the pivotal point ) and females started in the modified  knee push - up  position ( legs together , lower legs in contact with the mat with ankles plantar - flexed , back straight , hands shoulder width - apart , head up , using the knees as the pivotal point ) .
participants were instructed to raise their body by straightening the elbows and returning to the  down  position until their chin touched the mat ( their stomach should not touch the mat ) .
the maximal number of push - ups performed consecutively without rest was counted as the score .
the test was terminated when participant s strained forcibly or were unable to maintain correct technique within two repetitions . for the curl - up test ( 2 )
participants were instructed to assume a supine position on a mat with knees at 90 degrees .
arms were to be placed at the side , palms facing down with their middle fingers touching a piece of masking tape on the mat .
a second piece of masking tape was placed 10 cm apart below the first piece of masking tape .
next , participants performed slow , controlled curl - ups while lifting their shoulder blades off the mat ( elevation of the trunk to 30 degrees ) . once their middle fingers touched the second piece of masking tape ( 10 cm apart ) they returned to the starting position for the next repetition .
participants performed as many curl - ups as possible without pausing for one - minute .
once again , the test was terminated for the same reasons as the push - up test .
participants of the 12-week exercise program met three times per week ( monday , wednesday , friday ) , for one - hour exercise sessions ( 6 am group , 12 pm group ) .
the one - hour exercise sessions consisted of a 10-minute warm - up , 45- minute exercise class , and five - minute cool - down .
the exercise program consisted of a variety of cardiovascular and strength training classes targeting all major muscle groups and ranging from moderate- to high - intensity exercise .
more specifically , exercise classes included boot camp , whole - body weight training , dance fitness , and walking and/or running .
for example majority of the participants participated in boot camp on monday , running on wednesday , and whole - body weight training on friday .
all classes were supervised by exercise physiology students that were certified trainers and certified in cpr / first aid .
all classes followed a periodized / overload training format in which classes started at a lower - intensity and progressively increased to a higher - intensity .
exercise variables that were altered to elicit a new training stimulus and to avoid an overtraining effect included : exercises , sets , repetitions , rest intervals , and intensity . resting blood pressure ,
body mass , resting heart rate , post - exercise heart rate , recovery heart rate ( after a five - minute cool - down ) , and ratings of perceived exertion ( rpe ) were assessed on a weekly - basis for all participants .
these measurements were assessed so that each participant s progress and exercise intensity could be monitored .
all participants were taught how to take their own heart rate at the radial site ( 2 ) .
heart rate was used to assess each participant s target heart rate and was explained to all participant s that health - benefits were more likely to occur if they consistently exercised within this range ( 1 ) .
target heart rate was calculated using the following formula : 220  age = max heart rate ; max heart rate 
resting heart rate  .60.85 ( target heart rate intensity range ) + resting heart rate ( 1 ) .
finally , rpe was assessed with the borg scale of six ( no exertion at all ) to 20 ( maximal exertion ) ( 3 ) . all data were analyzed with spss version 17.0 ( spss incorporated , chicago , il ) with an a - priori  level of  0.05 .
males and females physical characteristics ( age , weight ) were compared using independent samples t - tests .
body mass , curl - ups , push - ups , sit - and - reach , and balance results were assessed prior to ( pre ) and after ( post ) the 12-week exercise program using paired samples t - tests .
note : gender differences were analyzed and females were significantly different than males in all health - related variables . due to the low sample size , males were left out of the final paired samples t - tests analysis so it could be observed how females improved from pre- to post - testing .

males and females physical characteristics ( age , weight ) were compared using independent samples t - tests .
body mass , curl - ups , push - ups , sit - and - reach , and balance results were assessed prior to ( pre ) and after ( post ) the 12-week exercise program using paired samples t - tests . note : gender differences were analyzed and females were significantly different than males in all health - related variables . due to the low sample size , males were left out of the final paired samples t - tests analysis so it could be observed how females improved from pre- to post - testing .
independent samples t - tests revealed no significant differences in males and females physical characteristics for age and weight ( table 1 ) . paired samples
t - tests illustrated a significant ( p < 0.001 ) decrease in body mass ( 91.88  24.14 kg pre ; 90.45  23.06 kg post ) ( figure 1 ) and significant ( p  0.001 ) improvements in curl - ups ( 32.8  11.4 pre ; 45.7  13.7 post ) , push - ups ( 16.3  11.6 pre ; 27.0  11.5 post ) ( figure 2 ) , sit - and - reach ( 23.7  10.8 cm pre ; 27.5  11.6 cm post ) ( figure 3 ) , and balance ( 2.2  0.7 pre ; 1.7  0.5 post ) ( figure 4 ) .
this study examined the effectiveness of a 12-week exercise program designed for the faculty and staff at a large , public , american university with specific aims at improving body mass , muscular strength and endurance , flexibility , and balance . today
s workers are faced with increased opportunities for sedentary behaviors , physical inactivity , and poor nutritional intake due to the type of work ( office work ) , inflexible work hours , and easy access to fast food and unhealthy snacks .
however , it is possible to develop healthy behaviors and ultimately improve the health and well - being of workers if proper worksite health promotion programs are implemented .
results from this study demonstrated that after a 12-week faculty and staff exercise program body mass , muscular strength and endurance , flexibility , and balance significantly improved from pre- to post - testing for females .
males did see improvements from pre- to post - testing but these improvements were not significant .
these outcomes were expected as previous research has indicated that worksite health promotion programs have the ability to improve health - related variables ( 4 , 5 , 9 , 13 ) .
however , limited evidence exists for the effect of physical activity programs incorporating a variety of intensity - related classes at large , public , american universities on health - related variables .
this current study provides evidence that a well - designed 12-week exercise program can improve health - related variables for faculty and staff in a university setting .
more importantly , the casual impact of a 12-week exercise program and its influence on faculty and staff is now known .
caloric expenditure is one of the many reasons why individuals participate in physical activity ( 10 ) . since majority of workers either sit or stand still for a large portion of the working day they are not achieving a sufficient caloric expenditure ( 14 ) . with this being known
, workers are possibly more at risk for being overweight and/or obese and therefore increasing their risk for developing chronic diseases ( 14 ) .
results from this study demonstrated that after a 12-week exercise program participant s had a significant decrease in body weight ( 91.88  24.14 kg pre ; 90.45  23.06 kg post ) .
when relating this 12-week exercise program to a chronic time frame such as 30-minutes of exercise three times per week for one year one would expect greater weight loss
. limitations of the current study included exercise equipment , majority of the participants being female , and no control group . due to the number of participants (
n = 57 ) there was a limited number of exercise equipment in terms of resistance bands , medicine balls , dumbbells , etc . also , since majority of the participants were female ( n = 51 ) our findings can not be generalized towards males with no causal impact being known .
participants did have the opportunity to attend health and nutritional seminars , however attendance was not recorded .
future research should include a sufficient amount of exercise equipment for all participants , a greater number of male participants ( larger sample size ) so findings can be inferred to them , controlling for diet or at least providing nutritional information , and a control group in order to know if the improvements in this study were due to the 12-week exercise program or some other external factor(s ) .
note : compliance was assessed with the current study ; however , it was not included in the data analysis .
future research should also focus on monitoring compliance as this is an important factor involved in changing one s health behaviors ( 1 , 11 ) .
a 12-week exercise program for faculty and staff at a large , public , american university is capable of promoting healthy behaviors due to increased opportunities for participation in physical activities .
more specifically , improvements were seen in body mass , muscular strength and endurance , flexibility , and balance which all have important implications in the efforts to combat the development of overweight and obesity , sarcopenia , and ultimately debilitating chronic diseases .
while further research is needed , the ability of this program to improve health - related variables in faculty and staff at a university setting is encouraging .
findings from the current study demonstrate that a 12-week exercise program for faculty and staff at a university setting is encouraging at improving several health - related variables , more so for females than males .
careful attention must be directed towards the development of appropriate exercise classes and programs , follow proper progression guidelines , and provide modifications for all exercises as this will possibly increase the adherence and participation within exercise programs at the worksite ( 1 , 6 ) .","INTRODUCTION

"participants : thirty - three children aged 712 years , diagnosed with adhd by a child and adolescent psychiatrist , were selected from a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic at imam hossein hospital ( tehran , iran).they also met the dsm - iv tr diagnostic criteria for adhd and had no comorbidity according to ksads ( kiddi - scadule for affective disorders and schizophrenia ) .
thirty - three age and sex- matched children were selected from the regional schools for the control group .
instruments : the figural ttct ( torrance test of creativity thinking ) and raven intelligence test , whose reliability in iran has been confirmed ( 23 ) , were conducted for both groups .
ttct is the most widely used test of its kind since it only requires the examinee to reflect upon their life experiences ( 24 ) .
the test- retest method for the ttct test in iran showed the reliability coefficient of 0.8 ( 25 ) .
the test takes 30 minutes and involves three tasks of drawing unusual and creative pictures . in first task
, the child should use a yellow bean shaped paper to demonstrate the idea of a story in his or her mind and choose a title for it .
the second task includes 10 incomplete pictures and the child should make the most unusual picture from each . in the third task , which involves a number of circles , the child should make as many pictures as he or she can .
creativity is assessed by four components including : fluency , flexibility , originality and elaboration .
task 1 is scored for originality , which means how rare and creative is the idea , and for elaboration , which shows how the examinee could explain the idea with details .
task 2 and 3 are scored for fluency , which is the number of meaningful ideas of each task , and flexibility , which shows how the subjects of ideas are different .
children with adhd did the ttct without receiving stimulants , but they received it before the iq test .
children with iq score of less than 90 were excluded from the study . written consent was obtained from each participant . statistical analysis : to compare the iq of the two groups , t - test was used and the creativity items between the two groups were compared by mann - whitney test with 0.05 significance level , using spss 19 .
the mean age of children in both groups was 92 and there were 9 girls and 24 boys in each group .
based on the results of the t - test , there was no statistically significant difference in the iq of the two groups .
creativity was assessed in four items : originality , fluency , flexibility and elaboration , using mann - whitney test .
the difference of the total scores of creativity in children with and without adhd was not statistically significant .
the scores of the fluency and the flexibility items were significantly better in the group without adhd ( 
 figure 1 ) . moreover , no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of elaboration and originality items .
comparison of iq and creativity items between children with and without adhd creativity results in children with and without adhd
in this study , the total score of creativity was not different between the two groups but children with adhd had worse function in fluency and flexibility items .
some studies reported less creativity of children with adhd during free play and performance of nonverbal , figural creativity tasks ( 10 , 20 ) and in other studies they were not different or worse in object usage ( ideational fluency ) , verbal fluency , and design fluency ( 5-points test ) ( 19 , 26 ) .
a number of studies showed no difference in creativity in children with and without adhd ( 1518 , 27 ) .
for instance , creativity and language , general science , and mathematics were compared between adhd and control group and no difference was found . however , a serious methodological limitation of this study was that the adhd diagnosis was done solely on the basis of teacher s ratings of hyperactivity on a dsm - iv evaluation form ( 18 ) . considering the lower function of children with adhd in other cognitive tasks such as naming speed , information processing speed and reaction time ( 14 ) , lower function in creative task could have been predictable too . on the other hand ,
if they were more creative than the normal population , this ability should have had a positive effect in their life , but usually people with adhd have many problems in their education and occupation .
in fact , adults with adhd are less likely to achieve educational ( and occupational ) level which is predicted based on their iq ( 2830 ) .
for example , although 84% of the adhd - diagnosed adults were statistically expected to be college graduates , only 50% reached this level of education ( 28 ) . in a study on 32 children , children with adhd showed better analysis for problem solving and more creative and unusual ideas ( 31 ) , but adhd diagnosis
was only based on teacher s report and the continuum of the symptoms in other situations were not evaluated .
another limitation was that the iq of the sample was all above 115 , so they were not representative of community sample of children with adhd .
a same result was found on thirty - seven 1017 years old students.the adhd group with equal iq had better creative tasks but worse working memory .
however , the sample was selected from a gifted student camp and was not representative of usual students with adhd , and the adhd diagnosis was done by self - report test and not professionally confirmed ( 32 ) . in our study , the iq of children with adhd was not statistically different from the control group and this finding was similar to that of other studies ( 1 , 33 ) . the relationship between iq and creativity was investigated in some studies , but the results were contradictory and inconclusive .
some suggest that creativity and iq are correlated until an iq of 120 ( 34 ) .
furthermore , it has been stated in the literature that creativity does not need high iq , and high intelligence does not bring creativity ( 35 ) . in our study , iq was assessed by raven test and was only used for screening and not for examining the relationship of iq and creativity .
this study was carried on normal range of iq to implicate the result on the usual population of children with adhd , while the higher creativity in other studies could be the result of high intelligence and not the adhd symptoms .
the similarities between adhd and creative people can not be a reason to expect creativity in people with adhd .
in fact , in some occasions , adhd and creativity may overlap and this calls for caution against misdiagnosis ( 1 ) . in some studies ,
the diagnosis of adhd was not accurate and was based on the report of the teachers or students ( 19 , 31 ) ; however , in our study , the diagnosis was done by a psychiatrist and was confirmed by ksads .
one limitation in this study was that the sample was from the known cases of adhd in the clinic .
clinic - referred samples of children with adhd are more likely to have co - occurring disabilities and lower iq ( 36 ) . in particular , these students with co - occurring disabilities are three to seven times more likely than their typical peers to be retained , suspended/ expelled from school , or receive special education services ( 37 ) .
in addition , we did not define adhd severity and subtypes , and the results might change in mild forms and in different subtypes of adhd . in our study ,
creativity was assessed without using medication , and this may have led to less attention and motivation for task completion , but due to the unknown effect of the stimulants on creativity , the abstinence of medication was necessary to prevent their effect on the results .
our results showed that creativity of children with adhd was not different from that of the control group or was worse in some areas .
although some adhd individuals are successful , their success may have not caused by adhd .","Materials and Method

"multiple techniques have been described to treat lumbar spinal spondylosis - related neural foraminal and spinal canal stenosis using various approaches , with or without spinal fixation .
the ease , safety , and biomechanical strength of pedicle screws have revolutionized the spinal stabilization techniques of the entire spine in general and lumbar spine in particular . despite the popularity of pedicle screws , alternative methods of spinal stabilization
interfacetal and transfacetal screws have been used , but have not gained their rightful status .
jamming of the only true joint of the spine and blocking the movements at the fulcrum provides biomechanical superiority to the procedure .
there have been only a few studies which have dealt with the anatomy of the facet joints either using cadaveric vertebrae or radiological imaging .
the authors evaluate the morphometric issues related to the lumbar facets and articular cavity and evaluate the feasibility of introduction of  goel facet spacer within the articular cavity .
the effects of these spacers on a number of spinal dimensions , particularly as it relates to spinal root and dural canal dimensions are evaluated . moreover , in order to successfully execute the goel facet distraction - arthrodesis technique , a detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the lumbar vertebral facet joints is essential .
twenty - five dried cadaveric lumbar vertebrae ( five sets of lumbar vertebrae l1 - 5 ) were procured from the department of anatomy and a number of morphological parameters were evaluated .
the width of the facet was estimated as the maximum lateral diameter of the facetal surface , and the thickness was calculated by measuring the maximum anteroposterior dimension of the facet .
interspinous distance was measured as the distance between the inferior origin of the spinous process of each vertebra and the superior origin of the spinous process of the successive vertebra below it when stacked vertically in order from l1 to l5 .
intervertebral foramen height was also measured for each pair of vertebrae as the maximum vertical distance between the pedicles of successive vertebrae .
the measurements for interspinous distance and intervertebral foramen height were repeated after insertion of goel intraarticular facetal spacers . additionally , the orientation of the vertebral facets was studied .
the angle formed by the facet with the transverse plane was measured between a line running through the posterior margin of the respective articular process and a horizontal line drawn touching the inferior margin of the facet in the transverse plane .
the angle formed by the facet with the sagittal plane was measured as the angle between a line running across the superior margin of the articular process and a line drawn in the sagittal plane through the middle of the vertebral body and the spinous process .
line ab denotes the height of the superior articular facet and line cd denotes the width superior view of the lumbar vertebra showing the thickness ( line ef ) of the facet and angle with sagittal plane ( right ) of the superior articular facet measured angle with transverse plane formed by superior ( upper angle ) and inferior ( lower angle ) articular facets the facetal height varied between 11.63 and 14.78 mm .
it was maximum at l5 , that is , 14.78 and minimum at l1 , that is , 11.63 with the most abrupt increase being between l1 and l2 . the width varied between 10.33 and 13.95 mm .
l5 had the maximum width of 13.95 mm , and l1 , the minimum width of 10.33 mm .
the most abrupt increase was between l1 ( 10.33 mm ) and l2 ( 11.95 mm ) .
thickness of the facets varied from 7.83 to 8.85 and was noted to increase from l1 to l4 and was the maximum at l4 . the maximum thickness measured was 8.85 mm at l4 and the minimum was 7.83 mm at l1 .
the angle of the facets with the sagittal plane (  ) was found to vary between 17.95 and 37.73 degrees .
the angle of the facets with the transverse plane (  ) was found to vary between 93.48 and 102.93 degrees .
the greatest difference in the angle  of the facets of two successive vertebrae was at l4 - 5 .
line ab denotes the height of the inferior articular facet and line cd denotes the width inferior view of the lumbar vertebra showing the thickness ( line ef ) of the facet and angle formed with sagittal plane ( right ) of the inferior articular facet the facetal height varied between 12.6 and 15.15 mm .
it was maximum at l5 , that is , 15.15 mm and minimum at l1 , that is , 12.6 mm with the most abrupt increase being between l1 and l2 and the least between l3 and l4 .
l5 had the maximum width of 13.05 mm , and l1 had a minimum width of 9.63 mm .
the most abrupt increase was between l1 and l2 , and l4 and l5 ( both 1.20 mm ) .
thickness of the facets varied from 8.76 to 10.75 mm and was noted to increase from l1 to l4 and was the maximum at l4 .
the maximum increase was at l1 - 2 and the least at l2 - 3 .
the angle of the facets with the sagittal plane (  ) was found to vary between 17.63 and 27.38 degrees .
the greatest difference in the angle  of the facets of two successive vertebrae was at l2 - 3 .
the angle of the facets with the transverse plane (  ) was found to be in a narrow range between 85.7 and 79.85. it was greatest at l1 and least at l5 .
the greatest difference in the angle  of the facets of two successive vertebrae was at l2 - 3 .
measurements of superior articular facets of lumbar vertebrae measurements of inferior articular facets of lumbar vertebrae as compared to the cervical facets , the lumbar facets were noted to have certain differences .
the superior facetal height was 7 - 12 mm for the cervical vertebrae as against 11.6 - 14.8 mm for the lumbar vertebrae .
the width was 7.5 - 12.0 mm for the cervical vertebrae as compared to 10.3 - 13.9 mm for the lumbar vertebrae and the thickness ranged from 3.5 to 6 mm for the cervical vertebrae as against 7.83 - 8.85 mm for the lumbar vertebrae .
the superior cervical vertebral facets had a posterior - posteromedial orientation and were vertically to horizontally oval in shape , depending on the level ; whereas , the superior lumbar vertebral facets had a posteromedial orientation and were vertically oval in shape at all levels .
the inferior facetal height was 7 - 13.5 mm for the cervical vertebrae as against 12.6 - 15.15 mm for the lumbar vertebrae .
the width was 8 - 15 mm for the cervical vertebrae as compared to 9.6 - 13.0 mm for the lumbar vertebrae .
the thickness ranged from 3 to 6 mm for the cervical vertebrae as compared to 8.76 - 10.75 mm for the lumbar vertebrae .

the thickness ranged from 3 to 6 mm for the cervical vertebrae as compared to 8.76 - 10.75 mm for the lumbar vertebrae .
the inferior cervical vertebral facets were posteromedially oriented and vertically to horizontally oval in shape , becoming progressively broader from higher to lower level , while the lumbar facets were oriented anterolaterally and were vertically oval in shape at all levels .
the intervertebral foraminal height was seen to range from 12.6 to 12.93 mm at the measured levels .
intervertebral foramen height before spacer insertion was seen to decrease slightly with each successive vertebral level , being greatest at l2 - 3 ( 12.93 mm ) and lowest at l4 - 5 ( 12.6 mm ) .
interspinous distance between the different pairs of lumbar vertebrae showed no remarkable variation with spinal level .
maximum distance was seen between l2 and l3 ( 10.6 mm ) , and least distance between l4 and l5 ( 9.5 mm ) .
the selected spacers had a surface area less than that of the vertebral facet joints to avoid injury to the exiting nerve roots .

spacer insertion dramatically increased interspinous distance by an average of 5.56 mm across all spinal levels .
the greatest increase was seen at l2 - 3 ( 6.7 mm ) , and the lowest increase was seen at l4 - 5 ( 4 mm ) .
the details of the changes seen in the various vertebral parameters after spacer insertion have been presented in table 3 .
degenerative spondylosis can be defined as a series of soft tissues  ligaments , cartilage , and disc  alterations that has genesis from facetal instability related to muscular weakness due to their misuse or disuse and subsequent 
ligamentous buckling , osteophyte formation , and disc space reduction that are hallmarks of spondylotic spinal disease appear to be secondary consequences to primary facetal instability .
the standing posture of human body lays an unusual and constant stress on the paraspinal muscles of the back .
facetal articulation is the only true joint of the spine on which the entire burden of the spinal pillar of motion , stability , and shape rests .
vertical facetal instability is a result of relative incompetence of the muscles due to  aging or due to inadequate nurture of its strength .
facetal over - riding , a phenomenon that is poorly appreciated on radiological imaging due to relatively inadequate delineation on conventional imaging and lack of anatomical and radiological studies .
such an event leads to reduction of space for spinal dural tube in spinal canal and nerve roots during their course in the intervertebral foramina .
the shape , size , orientation , and alignment of lumbar facets are remarkably different when compared to that of cervical facets .
the lumbar facets are strong and bulky and are oriented vertically when compared to cervical facets that are more transversely placed .
it is difficult to analyze , evaluate , and describe in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) perspective the facets and its angulations due to the complex turns and twists of its structure . due to the profiling of the facets , both anatomical and radiological studies have inherent limitations and
the superior facets are oriented ( with the articular surface facing posteromedially ) vertically in respect to transverse and coronal planes .
the inferior facets were oval in shape with the articular surfaces facing anterolaterally and almost at right angles to the transverse plane and at an angle of about 10 - 20 to the coronal plane .
the lumbar vertebral facets were concave ( superior facet ) and convex ( inferior facet ) rather than near flat , like those of the cervical vertebrae .
the shape of the superior as well as inferior lumbar vertebral facets was vertically oval at all levels , while that of the cervical ones was vertically oval at higher levels and horizontally oval at lower levels .
other studies done on lumbar vertebral facet anatomy have measured some of the parameters measured in this study as well as various other parameters such as facet joint surface area , etc .
panjabi found the average height of the vertebral facets from c3 to l5 to be ( 10.2 - 18.4 mm ) , width to be ( 9.6 - 16.3 mm ) , angle with sagittal plane to be ( 67 - 154 ) , and angle with transverse plane to be ( 41 - 86 ) .
, has found height to be 15.7 - 17.5 mm . on inserting of spacers intraoperatively ,
a tightening of the ligaments is expected as well as an increase in interfacetaland interspinous height . on anatomical examination of the bones , height of the intervertebral foramen
was found to increase by ( 1.77 mm ) , thereby allowing an increased space for the traverse of the nerve root .
radiological studies done on the vertebral facet joints have attempted to accurately measure various parameters of the joints .
algorithms have been designed to predict various parameters in vivo as well and computer software has been used to measure various vertebral facet joint parameters .
radiological imaging shows an error of 5 - 23 in the estimation of facet joint angles as compared to actual measured angles .
ebraheim et al . , in their study on relations of the facet joints reported the distance of the nerve root from the pedicle to be ( 5.3 mm superiorly and 1.5 mm inferiorly ) .
attar et al . , have also studied the relations of the pedicle , which can help to protect the structures surrounding the facet joints .
these can help estimate the position of the nerve root so as to protect it during insertion of the spacers .
the goel facetalspacers have been used by the senior author for the distraction of cervical and lumbar vertebrae for the treatment of 
the suitability for use in cervical spondylosis has been studied in a morphometric analysis of the cervical facet joints .
biomechanics of interfacetal spacers have been studied and this technique of distraction has been shown to be sound from the biomechanical point of view . during our study , we were unable to achieve fully accurate measurement of the various parameters due to the fact that we worked on dried bones , where the absence of soft tissue made it difficult to recreate the in vivo anatomy of the vertebrae .
the spacers are available in various sizes and it is our suggestion that thorough preoperative imaging could be used to determine the size needed in individual cases as improper selection of spacers could lead to misalignment of the vertebrae following insertion .
spondylosis is a series of changes that take place in both the bony and the cartilaginous elements of the vertebral facet joints , as well as the surrounding ligaments and vertebral bodies due to aging and lifestyle - related stresses , which cause weakness of muscles of the back .
there is vertical displacement of the two articular surfaces of the facet joints with respect to each other , due to vertebral instability arising due to muscular weakness and laxity of ligamentumflavum and the posterior longitudinal ligament .
this buckling of ligaments causes some degree of buckling of the spinal column as a whole , resulting in crowding of the vertebrae , leaving less space for the neural elements .
some of the pathological changes seen are osteophyte formation , thinning of facet joint articular cartilage discs , and change in water content of articular cartilage discs .
we believe that the root cause of all these changes is spinal instability , which causes some degree of vertebral facet joint dislocation resulting in secondary effects on the various tissues due to alterations in local dynamics .
we feel that this is the reason for symptom relief obtained by physiotherapy , which improves the strength of muscles , which buttress the vertebral column .
the correction of the primary abnormality , that is , instability of the spine improves or reverses the other changes and causes symptom relief .
various nonsurgical methods of traction presumably work by similar means , and have been used in the past .
advantages of our technique are that it gives us the ability to directly visualize the facet joints intraoperatively and get an idea of the degree of instability and corrective measures required .
moreover , the technique is relatively noninvasive as it does not deform the vertebral bones or create permanent defects . by correctly choosing spacers ,
the role of vertebral facet joint instability in spondylosis is suggested in the study by don et al . , which showed that a more coronal facet joint orientation might be linked to eventual spondylolisthesis .
masharawi et al . , have hinted at a possible relation between the development of symptoms and parameters such as area and orientation of facet joints .
the increase in facet area with age is seen to be more pronounced in cases of spondylosis . the study of vertebral facet curvature by van schaik and van pinxteren .
moreover , there have been studies showing that there is an inherent asymmetry of facet joint surface curvature bilaterally which might be an area for further study .
the anatomical analysis of the physical issues relating to facets , its orientation , and strength can be exploited in understanding the dynamics of the spine and in formulation of suitable treatment strategy .","INTRODUCTION

the world health organization has predicted that the global prevalence of diabetes will increase from 2.8% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2030 .
a main function of vitamin d is to regulate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and bone metabolism .
vitamin d may influence several nonskeletal medical conditions , including cardiovascular disease , cancer , autoimmune disorders , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , and t2 dm .
it has been reported that there is an inverse relationship between circulating levels of vitamin d and the prevalence of t2 dm .
in fact , vitamin d deficiency has being suggested as a risk factor for t2 dm .
some studies have shown that vitamin d may play a functional role on glucose tolerance through its effects on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity .
moreover , vitamin d seems to affect glucose homeostasis and found to be inversely related to glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) levels in gestational diabetes mellitus . in diabetes ,
oxidative stress is caused by both an increased formation of plasma - free radicals and a reduction in antioxidant defenses .
there is considerable evidence that the oxidative stress plays a key role in insulin resistance , impaired insulin secretion , and many of the complications of diabetes such as micro-/macro - vascular damage .
superoxide dismutase ( sod ) and glutathione peroxidase ( gpx ) are antioxidant enzymes that protect the body against active oxygen - free radicals . some experimental studies showed that vitamin d may have antioxidant properties by modifying some of the antioxidant enzymes .
therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin d ( 25[oh]d ) in patients with t2 dm and in nondiabetic healthy controls and to ascertain the impact of 25(oh)d levels on glycemic control and oxidative stress in t2 dm patients .
inclusion criteria were all cases diagnosed as male patients with t2 dm , aged 3653 years , attending the outpatient clinics of kasr el ainy hospital , cairo university .
exclusion criteria included use of drugs which affect calcium and bone metabolism , chronic disorders of liver and kidney , cancer , endocrinology disorders such as hypo - or hyper - thyroidism and hyperparathyroidism , insulin injection , use of anticonvulsion drugs , vitamin d , and calcium supplementation .
this study was approved by the committee of ethics and research of the university hospital .
weight and height were measured , and the body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated by dividing body weight by squared height ( kg / m ) .
blood samples were left to clot at room temperature and centrifuged , and the serum was separated and stored at 20c until further analysis . 

serum glucose concentrations ( fasting blood sugar [ fbs ] and postprandial blood sugar [ pp ] ) were measured by glucose oxidase method ( beckman glucose analyzer , fullerton , ca , usa)hba1c for patients was measured by affinity chromatography test using biosystem kit , usaserum levels of 25(oh)d were determined using radioimmunoassay ( ria ) technique by using 25(oh)d i ria kit ( diasorin , usa)sod activity was determined using the method of sun et al .

the statistical calculations were done using statistical package for the social sciences version 15 software , while the presentations were performed using microsoft excel 2007 .
serum vitamin d levels were significantly lower in patients with t2 dm than healthy controls ( p = 0.015 ) [ figure 1 ] .
patients with t2 dm had higher bmi as well as fbs and pp than healthy controls ( p = 0.012 , p = 0.000 , and p = 0.000 , respectively ) [ table 1 ] .
there was a significantly lower gpx activity in patients with t2 dm as compared with those of healthy controls ( p = 0.048 ) , but the difference in sod activity did not reach statistical significance [ table 1 ] .
table 2 illustrates the correlation between different studied parameters in patients with t2 dm . there was a significant negative correlation between serum vitamin d levels and hba1c ( p = 0.016 ) , and also there was a negative correlation between serum vitamin d levels and pp ( p = 0.018 ) , but no statistical correlation was shown between serum vitamin d levels and fbs , gpx , and sod .

t2 dm is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance and -cell dysfunction that ultimately leads to altered insulin secretion .
one among the environmental factors which may play a role in t2 dm pathogenesis is vitamin d deficiency .
vitamin d plays a wide range of functions in our body such as regulation of mineral homeostasis , bone remodeling , and also plays a role in immune system .
apart from these well - known functions , many studies have shown that vitamin d also plays an important role in -cell function , insulin sensitivity , and secretion by both direct and indirect actions . in our study
, we found that serum 25(oh)d levels were significantly lower in the group of t2 dm patients compared to control group .
showed that the patients who had higher levels of vitamin d concentration had lower fbs in comparison with the other groups .
in contrast , other studies , have not shown any difference in 25(oh)d between patients with diabetes compared to normal population . in t2 dm ,
the role of vitamin d was suggested from the presence of vitamin d receptors ( vdr ) on the pancreatic -islet cells . in these cells ,
the biologically active metabolite of vitamin d ( i.e. , 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin d[1,25(oh)2d ] ) enhances insulin production and secretion via its action on the vdr .
several studies demonstrated a relationship between single - nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes regulating vdr and vitamin d binding protein and glucose intolerance and insulin secretion .
this further supports a role for vitamin d in t2 dm and may explain the reduced overall risk of the disease in subjects who ingest > 800 iu / day of vitamin d. however , an alternative , perhaps related , explanation was proposed for the role of vitamin d in the prevention of t2 dm based on its potent immunomodulatory functions .
1,25(oh)2d modulates the production of the immunostimulatory interleukin ( il)-12 and the immunosuppressive il-10 , and vdrs are present in most types of immune cells .
hba1c is considered an indicator of average blood glucose concentrations during the preceding 23 months and thus a long - term marker of glucose homeostasis .
there was a negative correlation between vitamin d levels and pp , but no correlation between fasting glycemia and 25(oh)d was found , although that , vitamin d levels being related to glycemic control where hba1c reflects glucose control over time and it is more accurate than fbs and pp .
we found a nonsignificant difference in sod activity in patients with t2 dm when compared to controls .
sod is considered to be the first line of defense against oxidation stress ; it protects the body against active oxygen - free radicals by scavenging excess superoxide to form hydrogen peroxide which is then converted to water by gpx enzyme .
our results revealed that gpx activity was significantly low in patients with t2 dm , indicating decreased scavenging capacity of glutathione - dependent antioxidant defense system against elevated lipid peroxidation processes in these patients .
there was no significant correlation between serum levels of 25(oh)d and activities of gpx and sod enzymes in patients with t2 dm in our study .
there is contradiction about the activity of antioxidant enzymes in diabetes mellitus . both increased and decreased activities of these enzymes
. showed lower activity of sod and higher activities of gpx and glutathione reductase ( gr ) in patients with t2 dm compared to controls .
the main new finding of their study was determining the association between serum levels of 25(oh)d and activity of antioxidant enzymes in patients with t2 dm and healthy controls .
results of their study indicated an inverse relationship between serum levels of 25(oh)d and activities of gpx and gr and a positive trend with sod in patients with diabetes .
hisalkar et al . revealed a significant fall in both sod and gpx activities in patients with t2 dm when compared to controls which was in agreement with our results regarding gpx activity .
it was suggested that in the early stage of t2 dm , the antioxidant defense system counters the effects of increased free radicals , so it was supposed that the antioxidant enzymes activities increased as a compensatory response to oxidative stress , but by the advanced stage , the balance between generation of free radicals and antioxidant defense is impaired as a result of decreased antioxidant activities due to their possible depletion .
there is a considerable body of evidence indicating that hyperglycemia may interfere with natural defense of the antioxidant system , in addition to increasing the production of free radicals .
since sod enzyme is part of the first line of defense against free radicals , it is expected that the activity of this enzyme may be affected by oxidative stress before the other antioxidant enzymes .
. indicated that sod activity was lower in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls .
there is evidence to show that hyperglycemia is accompanied by the loss of cu , which is an essential cofactor in sod activity , and sod is inactivated by glycosylation in erythrocytes .
as hyperglycemia , a hallmark of diabetic condition , depletes natural antioxidants and facilitates the production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) through glucose autoxidation and nonenzymatic glycation of proteins , and as vitamin d levels were related to glycemic control in patients with t2 dm as indicated in our study , vitamin d supplementation can improve oxidative stress in patients with diabetes by improving glucose control .
wiseman reported that vitamin d3 can inhibit lipid peroxidation induced by iron in brain liposome ; therefore , vitamin d could serve as cellular membrane antioxidant .
also conducted a study in murine lymphoma and concluded that the anticancer effect of vitamin d3 is mainly through its antioxidant potential .
vitamin d can be considered as a casual antioxidant which scavenges ros in the first stage before activation of other stress - sensitive response pathways ; on the other hand , vitamin e or other antioxidants may be considered a more  symptomatic  rather than a causal treatment for oxidative stress because these antioxidants scavenge the already formed oxidants .
this study showed that vitamin d levels appear to be lower in patients with t2 dm than in the control group and vitamin d levels were related to glycemic control in t2 dm .
the study had some limitations ; the sample size was small and the sunlight exposure of each individual varies on a daily basis .
low level of vitamin d might play a significant role in t2 dm pathogenesis and this finding may have therapeutic implications as cautious vitamin d supplementation may improve glycemic control and oxidative stress in t2 dm .

"gingival enlargement , which may often be aesthetically disfiguring and compromising in function is a common side - effect seen with administration of drugs such as anticonvulsants , immunosuppresants and calcium channel blockers .
clinical features and histologic characteristics of gingival enlargement produced by all of these drugs appear indistinguishable from each other .
gingival enlargements , which are influenced by drugs may often have a genetic predisposition explaining the inter - patient and intra - patient variation .
drug - induced gingival enlargement has a higher prevalence among children often within 3 months of drug intake , commonly involving the anterior gingiva resulting in changes in gingival contour modifying gingival size . when complicated by the presence of plaque there may be changes in the gingival color , increased gingival exudate and pronounced inflammatory response of gingiva which may decrease in severity following reduction in plaque .
although drug influenced gingival enlargement can be found in periodontium with or without bone loss , it is not considered as etiology for attachment loss or pulp necrosis .
this report presents a case of a 22-month - old child suffering gingival enlargement induced by sodium valproate .
valproate is a food and drug administration approved drug used to treat seizures and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches .
some of the common adverse effects include tiredness , tremor , sedation , gastrointestinal disturbances and reversible hair loss .
this is a case report of 22-month - old male child , presented to the department with the chief complaint of enlargement of gums since 1 month .
patient was being treated for epilepsy since age of 5 months and is on clobazam for the same since then .
sodium valproate syrup was combined with clobazam before 1 month and had never received phenytoin .
his mother noticed slight enlargement of the gingiva on the 3 day after starting sodium valproate which progressively increased within 15 days covering entire crowns of all the erupted deciduous teeth making patient clinically edentulous [ figures 1 - 3 ] .
gingival enlargement extending to occlusal surfaces within a month of commencement of sodium valproate intake gingival enlargement extending to occlusal surfaces of mandibular teeth enlargement rendering patient clinically edentulous intraoral examination revealed gingiva which was pale pink , smooth and shiny with enlargement involving entire surfaces of all erupted teeth .
there was no spontaneous bleeding or bleeding on slightest provocation , which rules out leukemic involvement .
the patient belonged to a middle socio - economic group without any evidence of nutritional deficiency .
no similar history of gingival enlargement in his sibling or any other family member rules out hereditary gingival hyperplasia .
laboratory investigations showed blood counts within the normal range and electroencephalogram showed abnormal sleep patterns .
based on the medical history , laboratory investigations and clinical examination , case was diagnosed as gingival enlargement induced by sodium valproate .
patient was referred to the pediatric neurologist for alternate drug regimen and was prescribed levetiracetam as its alternative .
it is thought to bind to synaptic vesicle glycoproteins and inhibit presynaptic calcium channels eventually impeding impulse conduction across synapses .
patient was recalled for follow - up and interventional therapy considered in case of persistence of enlargement . at 1 month
follow - up showed regression of the gingival enlargement following drug alteration [ figure 4 ] .
patient is kept on follow - up and interventional therapy will be considered only if complete regression does not occur .
the soft - tissue component of periodontium like gingiva may be enlarged in response to various interactions between the host and the environment .
although such enlargement usually represents an inflammatory response to bacterial plaque , increased susceptibility as a result of systemic factors or conditions should always be considered during the course of patient evaluation .
systemically related gingival enlargements may include scurvy , leukemia , puberty , pregnancy , multi - system syndromes , selected drugs and/or agents and idiopathic fibrotic gingival enlargement . of the predisposing factors associated with disfiguring , disproportionate and functionally compromising overgrowth of gingival tissues , selected
anti - convulsant drugs , calcium channel blockers and immunosuppressants have generated the most investigative attention in the scientific community .
epilepsy or seizure activity affects 3 - 6% of the population therefore making it the second most prevalent nervous system disorder after stroke .
chronic convulsive disorders results in brief episodes of seizures associated with disturbance or loss of consciousness , these episodes are usually accompanied by characteristic body movements and sometimes by autonomic hyperactivity and are always correlated with abnormal encephalographic discharges .
the first description of a drug causing an enlargement of gingiva was associated with the use of phenytoin .
phenytoin which is used on a chronic regimen for control of epileptic seizures induces enlargements in approximately 50% of patients using this agent .
gingival hyperplasia is uncommon side effect of sodium valproate therapy ; its first case has been reported in a 15-month - old child by syrjnen and syrjnen in 1979 , followed by a case in a 14-year - old girl by behari in 1991 and in 9-years - old girl by anderson et al . in 1997 .
a study on gingival enlargement in children treated with anti - epileptics conducted by tan et al . in 2004 showed that duration of drug had a significant effect on gingival enlargement but not on gingival index , plaque index and probing pocket depth .
a case of fetal valproate syndrome with congenital gingival hyperplasia in a neonate was reported by rodriguez - vazquez et al . in the year 2007 and a case of valproate induced gingival enlargement in pre - existing chronic periodontitis in a 60-year - old female was reported by joshipura in 2012 .
patil et al . in 2014 reported a case of sodium valproate induced gingival enlargement in a 5 year old child in association with gobal developmental delay .
pathogenesis of gingival lesions is found in events at the cellular , subcellular and molecular levels , regardless of whether such individuals are treated by phenytoin or any other epileptic drug , institutionalized or not and retarded or not .
histological appearance of gingival overgrowth such as an increase in extracellular ground substance and number of fibroblasts are common characteristics .
one of the prominent theories of etiology of gingival enlargement in anti - epileptics suggests that the accumulation of genetically distinct populations of gingival fibroblasts causes connective tissue accumulation resulting from reduced catabolism of collagen molecule .
there is increase in rapidly proliferating gingival fibroblasts and increase in production of matrix macromolecules such as collagen , glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans . despite pharmacological diversity
may directly influence gingival connective tissues by stimulating an increase in number of gingival fibroblasts and production of connective tissue matrix .
this increase in cell number may be coupled with a reduction in breakdown of gingival connective tissue .
the inflammatory changes within the gingival tissues appear to influence the interaction between the inducing drug and the fibroblastic activity .
although the connective tissue changes may be predominant , the epithelium exhibits parakeratosis , proliferation and elongation of the rete ridges , which extend some distance into the lamina propria . a ten - fold increase in epithelial width ,
sodium valproate and other anti - epileptics such as phenytoin and carbamazepine along with having a broad therapeutic spectrum unfortunately are complicated by their unique pharmacokinetic properties .
they exhibit marked intra- and inter - individual as well as ethnic variability in the relationship between the serum concentrations and dose resulting in narrow therapeutic window .
the accepted therapeutic range of sodium valproate is 40 - 100 g / ml . monitoring of serum and salivary samples may help to identify non - compliance and aid in maximizing seizure control without serious adverse effects .
salivary samples besides being simple and easy to collect , it is non - invasive and inexpensive .
it is possible to monitor salivary concentrations as an alternative to serum concentrations of anti - epileptics as salivary levels may reflect their free levels in tissues and therefore have greater clinical relevance .
however according to available studies there is an controversial relationship between the severity of the gingival enlargement and drug dose , duration of therapy and drug concentrations in serum , saliva and gingival crevicular fluid .
the clinical manifestation of gingival over - growth is similar with all the three agents .
the enlargement is confined to the papillary and marginal gingiva , usually painless , firm and resilient , beginning in the papillary tissues and extending outward , involving both facial and lingual gingival margins , pale pink in color without tendency to bleed .
the color and texture is influenced by the presence of plaque - induced inflammation and the underlying periodontal condition .
red or bluish red discoloration with edema and increased bleeding tendency may be seen sometimes when complicated with inflammation .
. surgical reduction of the overgrown tissues is frequently necessary and may consist of gingivectomy in addition to scaling and root planning .
patients must be informed of the tendency for the recurrence of gingival enlargement as long as the associated medication is continued . in instances
where alternate medications can be used , regression of enlargement resulted following cessation of the associated agent .
although gingival enlargement influenced by drugs is rather a common entity , there are not many cases reported with sodium valproate induced gingival enlargement .
this case report would add to the literature assuming a stronger role of sodium valproate in causing gingival enlargement in epileptic children .","INTRODUCTION

"diabetic macular edema ( dme ) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in the working - age population in developed countries .
clinical trials data from europe and the united states indicate that , of the total diabetic population , 7%12% suffer from dme and 1%3% have visual impairment due to dme . the world health organization ( who ) estimates that the number of europeans with diabetes is expected to increase from 33 million ( 4 million in italy ) in 2000 to 48 million ( 5 million in italy ) in 2030 , with a likely corresponding increase in the prevalence of visual impairment due to dme .
therefore , in addition to systemic control of diabetes , identifying treatment strategies to effectively manage patients with dme is imperative . in italy
, there is currently no data available on the prevalence and incidence of legal blindness ( residual vision 1/20 ( 20/400 feet , 6/120 meters ) or lower for both the eyes ) in patients with diabetes . epidemiological data from italy
show that at least 30% of patients with diabetes suffer from retinopathy and that every year 1% of patients with diabetes are affected by the most severe forms of retinopathy . in the past ,
treatment options for dme were limited to laser photocoagulation , triamcinolone intravitreal injections , and vitrectomy [ 68 ] .
most of these target the prevention of vision loss and result in limited visual acuity ( va ) improvements , while causing safety concerns such as foveal burns , visual field defects , retinal fibrosis , and laser scars . of the antivascular endothelial growth factors ( vegf ) that are currently being used or investigated for ophthalmic conditions , ranibizumab ( lucentis ; novartis pharma ag , basel , switzerland , and genentech inc . ,
south san francisco , ca ) was the first vegf inhibitor approved by the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) , for the treatment of dme .
ranibizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fab fragment ( without the fc portion ) specifically designed for ocular use .
it binds to vegf - a with high affinity and inhibits all the isoforms of vegf - a .
data for treatment of dme with ranibizumab are based on prospective phases ii and iii randomized clinical studies , including read-2 , resolve , rise & ride , restore , restore extension , drcr.net ( protocol i ) , reveal , and lrt ( nct00444600 ) [ 1120 ] .
ranibizumab 0.5  mg pro re nata ( prn ) was identified as the new standard of care following the conclusion of the resolve   and restore   studies . at 12 months
, these studies showed that ranibizumab pooled group ( resolve ; 0.3  mg0.6  mg and 0.5  mg1.0  mg ) and ranibizumab 0.5  mg pro re nata ( restore ) provided superior va gains compared with controls ( resolve , 10.3 versus 1.4 with sham control , p < 0.0001 ; restore 6.8 versus 0.9 with laser control , p < 0.0001 ) .
long - term data from the 2- and 3-year restore extension [ 17 , 18 ] and drcr.net ( protocol i ) [ 13 , 14 ] studies , respectively , demonstrated that individualized ranibizumab 0.5  mg dosing maintained the initial bcva improvement observed at year 1 through years 2 and 3 , with lower number of injections .
in order to provide early access to ranibizumab for patients with no therapeutic alternative other than laser , novartis farma s.p.a initiated an expanded access program ( eap ) in italy ( the pride study ) in 2011 .
ranibizumab was administered to the patients according to the then approved label until reimbursement for dme indication and was available at the referral center according to the hospital formulary system ( prontuario terapeutico ospedaliero ( pto)/prontuario terapeutico ospedaliero regionale ( ptor ) ) requirements .
this eap provided the opportunity to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in italian patients with dme akin to the real - world / routine clinical practice .
additionally , most of the dme patients ( over 90% ) included in the study were not treatment - nave prior to study enrollment .
the study also analyzed the efficacy in patients with very poor vision ( best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) < 20/320 ) , who are typically excluded from clinical trials .
pride was a phase iiib , open - label eap study with a maximum of 18 months of follow - up period , conducted in 33 centers in italy from november 7 , 2011 , to october 8 , 2013 , in patients with visual impairment due to dme ( unilateral and bilateral ) .
informed consent was obtained from each patient in writing at screening , before any data were collected or procedure was performed .
the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and approval was obtained from the independent ethics committee or institutional review board in all the centers .
the study enrolled 617 patients , 18 years of age with either type i or type ii diabetes mellitus according to the american diabetes association or who guidelines and visual impairment due to focal / diffuse dme in at least one eye for which no suitable therapeutic alternatives existed .
the study included patients with both unilateral dme and bilateral dme ; if both eyes were eligible , the one with the worst va , as assessed at visit 1 , was selected for treatment in patients with bilateral dme unless , based on medical reasons , the investigator deemed the other eye more appropriate for treatment ( similar to the restore study ) .
patients were excluded if they had a history of uveitis in either eye , uncontrolled glaucoma in either eye ( intraocular pressure ( iop ) > 30  mmhg on medication or according to the investigator 's judgment ) , evidence of either vitreomacular traction ( in either eye ) or active proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( study eye ) , usage of intravitreal antiangiogenic drugs within 1 month before enrollment , pan retinal laser in the study eye within 6 months before enrollment , focal / grid laser in the study eye within 3 months before enrollment , or hypertension uncontrolled by medication .
the objective of the study was to provide an early access to ranibizumab for patients with visual impairment due to dme for whom no suitable therapeutic alternatives existed ( i.e. , existing therapies , e.g. , laser photocoagulation , have failed or were not indicated ) and to generate safety data of ranibizumab 0.5  mg treatment ( administered according to the european union summary of product characteristics ( eu smpc ) label , 2011 ) in an italian population that resembles future clinical practice . in our study , we analyzed the dataset seeking a difference between unilateral versus bilateral pathology in patients with dme ; however , only unilateral treatment ( one study eye ) was allowed .
enrolled patients received intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5  mg injections as per the then approved ranibizumab eu smpc label , 2011 .
initially , three consecutive monthly doses of ranibizumab 0.5  mg were administered until the maximum va was achieved .
the treatment was suspended upon stabilization of vision , that is , when there was no further improvement in bcva attributable to ranibizumab treatment for two consecutive visits .
patients were monitored monthly , and if a decrease in va due to disease activity was observed , monthly ranibizumab treatment was resumed until va was stable for 3 consecutive monthly assessments .
all patients were eligible to receive laser treatment at a minimum interval of 90 days according to the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study ( etdrs ) guidelines at the investigators ' discretion ( recorded as concomitant medication ) .
if both ranibizumab and laser were given on the same day , then ranibizumab was administered at least 30 minutes after laser treatment .
the proportion of patients receiving an injection at each visit , as well as the total number of injections administered from baseline to the end of the study ( i.e. , maximum until month 18 ) , and the number of visits , during which injections could be administered , were computed and described by the means of usual descriptive statistics .
in addition , the ratio between the total number of injections performed and the number of visits during which ranibizumab could be administered was determined . the number of patients with at least one study drug interruption was also calculated .
time to first retreatment , defined as the time elapsed ( in days ) from the last performed injection when va reached stability to the date of first injection following first treatment interruption , was computed .
safety was assessed by the incidence of ocular and systemic adverse events ( aes ) and serious adverse events ( saes ) , standard ophthalmic examinations and iop measurements , and so forth .
the incidence of aes and saes based on the standardized medical dictionary for regulatory activities was summarized by the primary system organ class ( soc ) and preferred term .
the total va was assessed at all scheduled visits using the snellen va charts ( i.e. , evaluations expressed in snellen 20/value fraction and as decimal scores ) .
efficacy outcomes are presented in terms of total va change from baseline ( the snellen scale and decimal scores ) and in terms of proportion of patients with improvement , worsening , or no change in total va at every study visit in the first 6 months of the treatment .
moreover , the efficacy was also assessed in the subgroup of patients ( i ) who were monocular or had a bcva score of 24 letters ( approximately < 20/320 snellen equivalent ) in the fellow eye and ( ii ) with at least 6 months of follow - up .
it consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of ranibizumab and had undergone at least one postbaseline safety assessment .
the efficacy analysis was conducted on the per protocol population as well as in the following subgroups : patients with at least 6 months of follow - up and in patients who were monocular or with va < 20/320 snellen in the fellow eye .
( i ) using the snellen scale ,  improvement  was defined as a decrease in the total va fraction denominator at the considered visit versus baseline ,  no change  was defined as no difference in the total va fraction denominator at the considered visit versus baseline , and  worsening  was defined as an increase in the total va fraction denominator at the considered visit versus baseline .
( ii ) using the decimal score ,  improvement  was defined as an increase of the considered visit fraction versus baseline ,  no change  was defined as no difference in the considered visit fraction versus baseline , and  worsening  was defined as a decrease of the considered visit fraction versus baseline .
data were summarized using frequency counts and percentage for categorical variables , mean , median , least square ( ls ) mean , standard deviation ( sd ) , standard error ( se ) , and min - max values for continuous variables .
a wilcoxon signed rank sum test to evaluate ( with descriptive meanings only ) the statistical significance of va change at 6 months versus baseline was performed for both unilateral and bilateral patients with dme .
a total of 617 patients were enrolled into the study , of which 612 received at least one dose of the study treatment ( safety set ) .
the baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well - balanced among the unilateral ( n = 157 ) and bilateral ( n = 455 ) patients with dme ( table 1 ) . a total of 515 ( 83.5% ) patients completed the study ( figure 1 ) .
overall , 102 of the 617 enrolled patients discontinued the study before the program 's closure
. the main reasons for discontinuation were consent withdrawal ( 32 , 5.2% ) , patients lost to follow - up ( 27 , 4.4% ) , and aes ( 19 , 3.1% ) .
notably , 56 ( 9.1% ) of the total enrolled patients had ocular disorders in the study eye that could confound the interpretation of results , compromise va , or require medical or surgical intervention during the study period .
the ocular disorders in such patients included cataract , retinal vascular occlusion , retinal detachment , macular hole , or choroidal neovascularization of any cause ( e.g. , age - related macular degeneration , ocular histoplasmosis , or pathologic myopia ) .
in addition , 18 ( 3% ) patients received laser treatment in the study eye during the study ( reported as protocol deviations ) . about 143 ( 31.4% ) bilateral dme patients and 41 ( 26.1% ) unilateral dme patients had received bevacizumab treatment ( for nonocular conditions ) ; 7 ( 1.5% ) bilateral dme patients and 1 ( 0.6% ) unilateral dme patient had received ranibizumab treatment prior to study enrollment while 1 ( 0.22% ) patient with bilateral dme had received dexamethasone treatment prior to study enrollment . on average , the study eye of unilateral and bilateral patients with dme received a mean ( median ) of 4.15 ( 4.00 ) and 4.40 ( 4.00 ) ranibizumab injections , respectively ( table 2 ) , with 7 visits on average over the first 6 months of follow - up .
a majority of patients received injections in the range of 2 to 5 ( interquartile range : 35 ) for unilateral dme ( 77.0% ) and in the range of 3 to 6 ( interquartile range : 36 ) injections for bilateral dme ( 70.8% ) .
the ratio of number of injections to the number of visits was , on average , 0.62  0.18 for unilateral and 0.65  0.19 for bilateral dme eyes . in the subgroup of patients with at least 6 months of follow - up
, the median number of injections was 4 ( interquartile range : 35 ) in patients with unilateral dme and 5 ( interquartile range : 4 - 5 ) in patients with bilateral dme .
overall , 86.6% ( n = 136/157 ) of the unilateral and 87.7% ( n = 399/455 ) of the bilateral patients achieved stable ocular condition at least once during the study that could last for more than one visit and hence suspended ranibizumab treatment .
the number of visits during which injections were not performed for these patients was , on an average , 3.22  2.45 ( unilateral ) and 2.83  2.27 ( bilateral ; ranges for both : 112 ) over the 18-month follow - up period . in the subgroup of patients with at least 6 months of follow - up , the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to stable ocular condition at any visit from baseline to month 6 were 82.4% in the unilateral group and 75.3% in the bilateral group .
a total of 28.7% ( n = 39/136 ) of the unilateral and 26.8% ( n = 107/399 ) of the bilateral patients resumed ranibizumab treatment at least once after having reached va stability .
time to first retreatment ( ls mean  se ) was , on an average , 160.37  7.16 ( unilateral ) and 175.17  5.93 ( bilateral ) days .
the differences between unilateral and bilateral dme were not statistically significant as determined by the log - rank test . in the subgroup of patients with at least 6 months of follow - up , time
to retreatment ( ls mean  se ) was 102.28  2.79 ( unilateral ) and 102.39  2.21 ( bilateral ) days .
saes were reported in 7 ( 4.5% ) patients with unilateral dme and 22 ( 4.8% ) patients with bilateral dme .
one case of ocular hypertension was classified as an sae that was not suspected to be related to ranibizumab ( table 3 ) .
cardiac disorders were the most frequently observed saes in unilateral ( 2 ( 1.3% ) ) and bilateral ( 6 ( 1.3% ) ) patients with dme .
ischemic stroke , hypertension , and ischemic cardiomyopathy ( 1 each , 0.2% ) in bilateral dme were suspected to be related to the study drug .
one ( 0.6% ) patient with unilateral dme and 2 ( 0.4% ) patients with bilateral dme died during the study due to acute renal failure , lung carcinoma , and cardiac arrest ; none of them were considered to be related to ranibizumab treatment .
the occurrence of one or more aes was reported in 12 ( 7.6% ) patients with unilateral dme and 49 ( 10.8% ) patients with bilateral dme .
the percentages of patients with at least one ocular ae were 5 ( 3.2% ) and 19 ( 4.2% ) among the unilateral and bilateral dme patients .
the proportions of patients with systemic aes were 7 ( 4.5% ) and 36 ( 8.0% ) in unilateral and bilateral patients , respectively . among patients with unilateral and bilateral dme , eye disorders ( 5 ( 3.2% ) and 19 ( 4.2% ) ) , cardiac disorders ( 2 ( 1.3% ) and 6 ( 1.3% ) ) , and nervous system disorders ( 2 ( 1.3% ) and 5 ( 1.1% ) ) were the most frequently observed soc .
the nonocular aes of infections and infestations were observed only in patients with bilateral dme ( 8 ( 1.8% ) ; table 4 ) .
as assessed by the investigator , the aes suspected to be related to ranibizumab treatment were reported in 1 ( 0.6% ) patient with unilateral dme and 7 ( 1.5% ) patients with bilateral dme . in the patient with unilateral dme ,
these aes were categorized as ocular hypertension and cataract . in patients with bilateral dme ,
3 patients reported eye disorders suspected to be related to the study drug , 2 categorized with the cataract ( 0.4% ) , and the other one with increased lacrimation ( 0.2% ) .
the other aes possibly related to study drug were ischemic stroke ( sae ) , hypertension ( sae ) , ischemic cardiomyopathy ( sae ) , microalbuminuria , and iop increase .
eight patients ( 5.1% ) with unilateral dme and 14 ( 3.1% ) patients with bilateral dme discontinued the study due to aes . in patients with unilateral and bilateral dme ,
cardiac disorders ( 2 ( 1.3% ) and 4 ( 0.9% ) ) and nervous system disorders ( 2 ( 1.3% ) and 3 ( 0.7% ) ) were the most frequent aes leading to discontinuation .
two ( 0.4% ) patients with bilateral dme and 1 ( 0.6% ) patient with unilateral dme discontinued for events categorized as vascular disorders ( arterial disorder in unilateral dme and hypertension and hypertensive crisis in bilateral dme ) . patients recruited in the study had no therapeutic alternative ; over 90% of the patients received mainly laser and/or bevacizumab prior to study enrollment and , hence , were not treatment - nave .
overall , treatment with ranibizumab helped either improve or maintain va of the treated eye in patients with both unilateral and bilateral dme .
the mean baseline va ( in snellen ( 20/value)/decimal score ) was 73.17/4.11 and 88.02/3.72 in patients with unilateral and bilateral dme , respectively .
the snellen fraction denominators of total va measured on the treated eye tended to decrease during the study in unilateral and bilateral dme patients , by a mean (  sd ) of 16.7  37.84 and 23.62  40.51 snellen ( 20/value ) compared with baseline va . in terms of decimal score , the mean ( sd ) va gain in unilateral and bilateral patients was 1.5  2.38 and 1.22  1.67 at month 5 , respectively , compared with baseline va ( figure 2 ) .
the va loss ( in decimal and snellen scores ) at month 14 was due to treatment interruptions at month 12 and month 13 because of ocular stability ( the patient 's va was stable for two consecutive monthly assessments ) .
patients were treated again at month 14 which led to an increase in va response at month 15 .
the percentage of  improvement  in va through visits was found to be higher than that of  worsening  and  no change  for both unilateral ( 61.2% ( improvement ) versus 10.2% ( worsening ) and 24.5% ( no change ) ) and bilateral patients ( 68.8% ( improvement ) versus 16.8% ( worsening ) and 13.6% ( no change ) ) with dme .
the proportion of unilateral patients with a total va improvement increased from 40.2% at month 1 to 61.2% over 6 months of follow - up . similarly , in bilateral patients with dme , the proportion increased from 52.5% to 68.8% from month 1 to month 6 ( figure 3 ) .
a decrease in the snellen fraction denominators and a gain in the decimal scores were observed in both unilateral and bilateral patients ( up to 27.4 and 0.41 at visit 3 ( month 1 ) and up to 50.6 and 2.39 at visit 6 ( month 4 ) , resp .
, considering only the first visits involved the maximum number of patients ) when compared with mean baseline va ( in snellen ( 20/value)/decimal score ) of 132.09/3.12 and 189.45/2.99 of unilateral and bilateral patients with dme .
greatest improvement in the median va change was observed after 3 - 4 months from the start of the study , with a decrease in denominators equal to 9 ( unilateral ) and 12 ( bilateral ; figure 4 ) in terms of snellen ( 20/value ) and a gain of 1 decimal score in both unilateral and bilateral patients with dme .
the wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed that the total va after 6 months of follow - up reached a strong statistical significance ( p < 0.0001 ) for both unilateral and bilateral patients with dme compared with baseline ( figure 4 ) .
the pride study evaluated the outcome of an eap in italy that aimed to provide early access to ranibizumab treatment for patients with dme who had no therapeutic alternative ; most patients were not nave to treatment before entering the study ( i.e. , received several different treatments including laser , ranibizumab , and/or bevacizumab ) . as a result of this study ,
612 patients with dme received ranibizumab treatment , while reimbursement was under consideration by the italian medicines agency ( agenzia italiana del farmaco ) .
after reimbursement was granted on december 6 , 2012 , cancellation of the pride eap study resulted in a variable follow - up period ranging from a minimum of 1 month to a maximum of 18 months for enrolled patients , with the majority completing 6 months of follow - up in the study .
the pride study recruited outpatients from 33 centers in italy and was largely reflective of the real - world clinical setting .
overall , ranibizumab was well - tolerated in the italian patient population , with no new ocular or nonocular safety findings during eap .
ranibizumab treatment either improved or maintained va in both unilateral and bilateral patients with dme .
the incidence of ocular and nonocular aes and saes during the study period was low and consistent with those observed in randomized clinical trials of ranibizumab 0.5  mg prn in patients with visual impairment due to dme [ 11 , 13 , 14 , 1618 ] .
one patient with unilateral dme ( 0.6% ) and two with bilateral dme ( 0.4% ) died during the study primarily due to acute renal failure , lung carcinoma , and cardiac arrest .
none of the deaths were considered to be related to ranibizumab treatment . in the pride study ,
most patients received 26 injections , with unilateral patients with dme receiving slightly fewer injections than those with bilateral dme . in patients who completed 6 months of the follow - up period , the greatest improvement in median va change ( snellen ( 20/value ) )
the average number of injections received by patients in the pride study was comparable to the recent ranibizumab studies in dme , such as relight   ( 8 in follow - up period of 18 months ; patients received monthly prn in first 6 months and bimonthly prn treatment thereafter ) and retain   ( 10 in 24 months in the prn arm ) which resulted in a mean change in bcva of 6.5 letters ( prn arm ) , in the relight study , and 7.44 letters ( prn arm ) , in the retain study .
this trend was also observed in the long - term restore and drcr.net ( protocol i ) studies which showed that the initial bcva improvements observed at year 1 were maintained through years 2 and 3 with a reduced number of injections [ 11 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 ] .
the pride study which is reflective of real - world data likewise showed that not all patients required monthly treatment .
the lower injection numbers and consequent lower va outcomes in the pride study may be explained by the retreatment criteria used in the study .
this includes injecting every month until va stabilizes ; option to extend monitoring by four weekly intervals , if va remains stable , for a maximum of 12 weeks ; and retreatment based on va and/or morphological parameters .
overall , during the eap , treatment with ranibizumab either improved or maintained va of the treated eye in both patients with unilateral or bilateral dme . in addition , a subgroup analysis further corroborated that va either improved or was maintained in the majority of patients in this study .
approximately , 1/2 of the patients demonstrated an initial va improvement and achieved stability as early as months 2 - 3 , with 3 - 4 ranibizumab injections .
patients were treated as per the eu smpc , 2011 , which mandated ranibizumab injections until va was stable for 3 consecutive months .
categories of total va change classified as  improvement ,   worsening ,  or  no change  also showed better efficacy outcomes with ranibizumab treatment in the treated eyes , and the percentages of improvement through visits were found to be definitively higher than the proportions of  worsening  and  no change  for both unilateral and bilateral patients with dme .
analyses repeated on subgroups of particular interest , that is , patients who were monocular or with bcva < 20/320 snellen in the fellow eye and patients who had completed 6 months of the follow - up period , confirmed the evidence emerging from the safety and the per - protocol populations .
ranibizumab injections were associated on average with va improvement in the treated eye that reached statistical significance during 6 months of the follow - up period .
about 3% of the enrolled patients received laser treatment in the study eye that was reported as a protocol deviation in the study .
overall , 9% of the enrolled patients had ocular disorders in the study eye that could confound the interpretation of results , compromise va , or required medical or surgical intervention during the study period ( reported as protocol deviation ) , possibly influencing the va outcomes .
another limitation of the study was that the effect of pretreatment with laser ( reported as protocol deviation ) or anti - vegfs including bevacizumab or ranibizumab that may have an impact on the overall bcva outcomes of such patients was not analyzed separately during the course of the study .
also , caution needs to be exercised when comparing outcomes of pride ( real - world experience ) , with the randomized clinical trials investigating ranibizumab for visual impairment due to dme .
the pride study , an eap , demonstrated that ranibizumab administered according to the eu smpc , 2011 was generally well - tolerated and either improved or maintained va in patients with dme , despite the fact that more than 90% of the patients were not treatment - nave .
the current study adds to the overall real - world clinical experience of ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment due to dme .","1. Introduction

"various cell cycle checkpoints ensure coordinated progression of the cell cycle ( hartwell and weinert , 1989 ) and checkpoint defects result in gene mutations , chromosome damage , and aneuploidy , all of which can contribute to tumorigenesis ( paulovich et al . , 1997 ) .
a molecular understanding of various cellular checkpoints should therefore provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches for many cancers with abnormalities in checkpoint functions ( stewart and pietenpol , 1999 ) .
the g1 checkpoint permits repair prior to replication , whereas the g2 checkpoint allows repair of the genome prior to its mitotic segregation .
the p53 tumor suppressor gene , which is suppressed by mutation in approximately one - half of human tumors ( hollstein et al . ,
1991 ) , has been shown to be integral to both the g1 ( kuerbitz et al . , 1992 ) and g2 ( bunz et al . , 1998 ) dna damage checkpoint machinery .
in addition to dna damage , spindle damage induces a transient arrest at the metaphase - anaphase transition point ( rudner and murray , 1996 ; amon , 1999 ) , but eventually escape from this block and exit mitosis without proper segregation of sister chromatids and cytokinesis ( jordan et al . , 1991 , 1996 ; torres and horwitz , 1998 ) .
therefore , spindle - damaged cells arrest at a g1-like state with an intact nucleus containing 4n dna , but without ever completing mitosis ( minn et al . , 1996 ; lanni and jacks , 1998 ) .
actin depolymerizing agents such as pectenotoxin-2 ( ptx-2 ) and dihydrocytochalasin b ( dcb ) , which inhibit cytokinesis by depolymerizing actin filaments , also lead to tetraploid g1 arrest ( andreassen et al . , 2001 ; chae et al . ,
since actin - damaging agents do not affect spindle function and chromatid segregation , but only inhibit cytokinesis , the tetraploid g1 checkpoint seems to be a general checkpoint control acting in g1 to recognize tetraploid cells and induce their arrest and thereby prevent the generation of aneuploidy ( margolis et al .
we previously reported that loss of p53 sensitizes tumor cells to actin damage induced by treatment with actin - depolymerizing or knotting agents ( chae et al . , 2005 ) .
upon actin damage , bim expression was induced in tumor cells lacking functional p53 followed by conformational changes of bax protein ( chae et al . , 2005 ) . furthermore , induction of bimmediated apoptosis by actin damage in p53-deficient cells results from constitutive cdk2 activation and its associated genomic instability ( chae et al . , 2008 ) . in this study , we demonstrate that actin damage , like dna damage , induces phosphorylation of ser-15 and ser-37 residues of p53 protein , but the upstream signaling pathways leading to the phosphorylation was different in between dna and actin damage responses . however , although dna - pkcs is not responsible for phosphorylation of p53 protein , it was shown to be essential for the maintenance of tetraploid g1 arrest following actin damage and cytokinesis failure .
we previously reported that actin damage induces tetraploid g1-arrest by activating the p53 tumor suppressor protein , which leads to inactivation of cdk2 ( chae et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) .
in this study , we first addressed the molecular mechanism underlying p53 induction by actin damage . since it has been clearly shown that p53 accumulation is largely dependent on the phosphorylation state of the amino - terminal region of p53 protein ( giaccia and kastan , 1998 ; ashcroft et al .
, 1999 ; oren , 1999 ) , we examined major phosphorylation sites of the n - terminal region of p53 .
while a dna damaging agent , doxorubicin , induced phosphorylation of serine residues located at the amino terminal , namely ser-15 , -20 , and -37 , all of the actin inhibitors tested here induced phosphorylation of ser-15 and -37 , but left ser-20 unphosphorylated ( figures 1a and 1b ) .
it was further examined the effects of caffeine and wortmannin , two pi3 kinase inhibitors known to inhibit p53 phosphorylation upon dna damage ( ui et al . , 1995 ;
kaufmann et al . , 2003 ) , on the phosphorylation of ser-15 and -37 of p53 .
both inhibitors blocked dna damage - induced phosphorylation of all three serine residues in p53 protein ( figure 2a ) .
however , we found that the pi3 kinase inhibitors function differentially in the phosphorylation of p53 induced by actin damage . while caffeine did not inhibit ptx-2-induced phosphorylation of ser-15 and ser-37 , wortmannin blocked their phosphorylation ( figure 2b ) .
pd98059 and sb212090 , which inhibit erk1 and p38 , respectively , did not affect phosphorylation of ser-15 and ser-37 ( figure 2c ) .
thus , these results suggest that a caffeine - insensitive , but a wortmannin - sensitive kinase is responsible for actin damage - induced phosphorylation of the ser-15 residue of p53 . since both ser-15 and ser-37 of p53 are phosphorylated by atm kinase in response to dna damage , atm - positive and -deficient cells were examined for ptx-2 dependent phosphorylation of those residues of p53 .
ag04405 cells , which are derived from an at patient deficient in atm , and normal fibroblasts such as hdf , wi38 , and imr-90 , exhibited cell cycle arrest and phosphorylation of p53 protein upon actin damage ( figures 3a and 3b ) , indicating that actin damage induces phosphorylation of p53 ser-15 in an atm - independent manner .
therefore these results suggest that upstream signaling pathway leading p53 phosphorylation is different in between dna and actin damage responses . among pi3 kinases ,
dna - pkcs is the most resistant to inhibition by caffeine ( sarkaria et al . , 1999 ) .
induction of p53 expression and ser-15 phosphorylation was not affected by the knockdown of dna - pkcs ( figure 4a ) . however , unexpectedly , dna - pkcs knockdown cells exhibited enhanced apoptotic death following treatment with ptx-2 in association with an increased number of polyploid cells ( figure 4b ) .
therefore , these results suggest that dna - pkcs does not account for p53 phosphorylation , but is involved in the maintenance of tetraploid g1 arrest following actin damage . because of p53-independent function of dna - pkcs in tetraploid g1 arrest , we further examined whether p53 induction is a result of actin damage or polyploidy . to end this ,
cells were first arrested at early s phase by double thymidine block ( park et al . , 2000 ) . while cells treated with ptx-2 alone exhibited tetraploid ( 4n ) and polyploidy ( 8n ) , those synchronized by double thymidine block kept arresting at g1/s after the ptx-2 treatment ( figure 5a ) . however , p53 induction was not observed in cells synchronized by the thymidine block upon treatment with ptx-2 ( figure 5b ) , implying that the perturbation of actin cytoskeleton by ptx-2 does not induce p53 in cells arrested at g1/s phase .
therefore , these results suggest that p53 induction upon actin damage is not merely a result of perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton . instead , cell may recognize actin damage - induced polyploidy as a stress signal inducing p53 .
taken together these , p53 and dna - pkcs function independently to sustain tetraploid g1 arrest and prevent polyploidy formation .

"hypothyroidism , both overt and subclinical , is common in women of reproductive age and during pregnancy , with frequencies ranging from 0.3% to 2.5% .
several studies have reported that maternal hypothyroidism is associated with increased risks of abortions , stillbirths , preterm delivery , and pregnancy - induced hypertension [ 36 ] .
conversely , other reports have shown successful pregnancy outcomes in women who were profoundly hypothyroid . more recently , the potential adverse impact of maternal hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinemia , even when subclinical , on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring has been recognized [ 79 ] .
hypothyroidism should be corrected before initiation of pregnancy , replacement dosage should be augmented early in pregnancy , and euthyroidism should be maintained throughout .
maternal hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of low birth weight , predisposing to neonatal morbidity and mortality .
in addition , medici et al .   have reported that maternal high - normal ft4 levels in early pregnancy are associated with lower birth weight and an increased risk of small for gestational age ( sga ) newborns .
thyroid - stimulating hormone surges soon after birth , resulting in thyroxine ( t4 ) concentrations that are higher in the first postnatal week than at any other time of life and in circulating triiodothyronine ( t3 ) concentrations that are three to four times higher than fetus .
thyroid hormone synthesis is critically dependent on an adequate prenatal and postnatal supply of iodine , which can paradoxically suppress t4 secretion when present in excess , especially in preterm infants and in the presence of iodine deficiency .
neonatal hypothyroidism has an incidence of one in 3.0004.000 births and includes both permanent and transient types .
primary congenital hypothyroidism consists of disorders of thyroid development or of thyroid hormone synthesis [ 1517 ] .
transient congenital hypothyroidism can be due to iodine deficiency or excess , maternal consumption of goitrogens or antithyroid medications during pregnancy , transplacental passage of tsh receptor - blocking antibodies , and neonatal very low birth weight and prematurity .
the aim of this study is to investigate obstetric features of pregnant women with thyroid disorders and postnatal clinical course and thyroid function tests of their newborn infants .
the study group consisted of the pregnant women with thyroid disorders followed in the obstetric outpatient clinic at marmara unversity hospital in turkey , in 20082010 .
the control group was composed of healthy pregnant women who presented to the obstetric outpatient clinic on the same day of the enrollment of a hypothyroid patient .
the definition of maternal hypothyroidism was based on the diagnosis of an endocrinologist , and thyroid hormone replacement was done throughout pregnancy . during clinical followup , thyroid function tests including ft4 and tsh and thyroid autoantibody titers ( anti - tpo and atg ) were measured .
hypothyroid women with positive atg and anti - tpo titers were assigned as group i ( n = 13 ) , and those who did not have autoantibodies were assigned as group ii ( n = 21 ) , while women without thyroid problems were assigned as group iii ( n = 92 ) .
thyroid tests of the infants were measured in the first postnatal week and third postnatal week in the study group .
thyroid function test of the infants of control group was checked before discharge from the hospital .
serum tsh , ft4 , anti - tpo , and atg was measured by chemiluminescence assay ( roche , switzerland ) .
newborns with serum tsh 20  miu / l were considered abnormal at first postnatal week and were recalled for further evaluation . on the 3rd week , if tsh > 7  miu / l and ft4 < 1  ng / dl , the infant was considered to have congenital hypothyroidism , and those with high tsh at the first week but normal serum tsh and t4 values at the third week were considered to have transient hyperthyrotropinemia ( tht ) .
atg > 100  iu / ml and anti - tpo > 30  iu / ml were considered to be abnormal .
informed consent was obtained from all patients , and the study was approved by institutional review board . 

mann - whitney u and kruskal - wallis tests were used for quantitative variables and fischer 's exact test was used for categorical variables .
correlation between neonatal and mother anti - tpo and atg was assessed by spearman 's rank correlation test .
maternal age , parity , and previous abortus history were not significantly different among the groups . however , pregnant women with autoimmune hypothyroidism ( group i ) had more preterm delivery , and their babies needed more frequent nicu admission .
rates for gestational diabetes mellitus ( 21.6% ) and pregnancy - induced hypertension ( 14.5% ) tended to be higher in mothers with thyroid problem ( groups i - ii ) compared to the control group ( 1.8% and 2.1% , resp . ) .
treatment for infertility was required in 38.% ( n = 5 ) of mothers in group i , 9.5% ( n = 2 ) in group ii , 3.2% ( n = 3 ) in group iii . however , due to inadequate sample size , statistical analysis was not possible .  
six infants in group i ( 40% ) had positive anti - tpo titers at the end of the 1st postnatal week ; all except one had undetectable titers at the end of the 3rd week .
mean maternal tpo titers were significantly higher in infants with positive tpo titers compared to infants with negative titers ( 362.6  115 
iu / ml versus 47.8  7.4  iu / ml ; p = 0.001 , r = 0,756 ) .
ten mothers had high atg titers whereas none of their infants had high atg titers .
in the followup , thyroid functions tests were entirely normal at the 8th postnatal week .  
five infants ( 23.8% ) in group ii had tsh levels > 20  miu / ml .
, all tsh values returned to normal ranges at the 8th postnatal week ( table 2 ) .
median maternal tsh level of these five infants with tsh > 20  miu / ml was 6.6  miu / ml . in group iii ,
six infants ( 6.5% ) had tsh levels above > 20  miu / ml at the 1st postnatal week , but tsh levels returned to normal at the 3rd week in all .
the results indicated a higher neonatal tsh recall rate in infants of mother with thyroid problems ( p = 0.02 ) .
the comparison of maternal tsh and ft4 levels at 3rd trimester revealed statistically significant difference between groups indicating inadequately controlled patients among groups i and ii ( table 1 ) .
in this study , we found that pregnant women with autoimmune hypothyroidism had more preterm delivery and their babies needed more frequent nicu admission .
the infants of hypothyroid mothers had higher recall rate in newborn tsh screening and transient thyroid dysfunction in the first 8 weeks of life .
the frequency of thyroid deficiency varies among pregnant women in different countries and ranges between 0.19% in japan and as high as 2.2% in belgium and 2.5% in the united states [ 1820 ] .
maternal thyroid deficiency , even subclinical , has been reported to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes that may be improved by t4 replacement .
fluctuations that occur in t4 metabolism during pregnancy make it difficult to maintain meticulous normal thyroid hormone values during gestation in hypothyroid mothers .
pregnancy causes increased thyroid gland vascularity , increased renal iodide clearance , and iodide losses to the foetus .
prenatal vitamin supplements commonly taken during pregnancy are rich in iron and calcium , both of which inhibit thyroxine absorption [ 22 , 23 ] . many prenatal vitamins do not contain the recommended 200  g of iodine for pregnancy .
fluctuations in thyroxine metabolism that occur during pregnancy may further impair maternal - foetal transfer of thyroxine despite apparently optimal maternal thyroid status .
reduced foetal thyroxine may cause disruption to the development of the pituitary - thyroid axis of the newborn , foetal pituitary gh secretion , vascular responsiveness and maturation , and cardiovascular homeostasis in utero [ 2527 ] .
these factors may be responsible for the observation of a reduced neonatal birthweight of offspring born to mothers with inadequately controlled thyroid status at initial presentation and at the third trimester .
pregnant women who at first presentation had above 98 percentile of tsh levels or those whose tsh remained suboptimal in the final trimester of pregnancy may be more likely to give birth to a low - birthweight infant .
several studies have reported that maternal hypothyroidism is associated with increased risks of abortions , stillbirths , preterm delivery , and pregnancy - induced hypertension [ 36 ] .
similarly , the presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin is associated with a significant increment in miscarriages . in our study ,
26.7% of mothers in group i had a previous abortus history , but probably due to inadequate sample size , this is not significantly different than the control group .
documented an increased rate of preterm birth in 87 women with autoimmune thyroid disease . in our study ,
rates for gestational diabetes mellitus , pregnancy - induced hypertension , and treatment of infertility tended to be higher in mothers with both autoimmune ( group i ) and nonautoimmune thyroid diseases ( group ii ) compared to the control group .
autoimmune thyroid disease inpregnancy possesses important risk factors both for the mother , the fetus , and newborn infant .
the clinical and endocrinological pictures of the thyroid disease in pregnant women and their offsprings can vary greatly and mainly depend on the type and amount of the anti - thyroid autoantibodies which cross the placenta .
the reported prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in pregnant women ranges from 5.2% in belgium to 12.5% in north america .
although a uniform correlation between maternal or newborn serum thyroid autoantibodies and sporadic congenital hypothyroidism is lacking , there are many reports relating maternal autoimmune thyroid disease to transient congenital hypothyroidism in newborn thyroid screening programs [ 3133 ] .
dussault and fisher   documented that elevated tsh concentrations were more frequent ( 7.0% versus 0.9% ; p < 0.001 ) in the mothers of hypothyroid newborns .
they also documented that the prevalence of newborn transient hypothyroidism was significantly higher ( 27% versus 15% , p = 0.04 ) in the mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease .
demonstrated that none of the newborn infants with maternal hashimato disease in the early neonatal period had abnormal thyroid function tests or physical examination findings . in our study , six infants in group i ( 40% ) had positive anti - tpo titers at the end of the first postnatal week , all except one who had undetectable titers at the end of the third week .
mean maternal anti - tpo titers were significantly higher in infants with positive titers compared to infants with negative titers .
none of the infants of mothers with elevated anti - tg antibodies had elevated serum anti - tg levels .
these results suggest that maternal tpo levels especially the high titers are transferred to the infant and are clinically more relevant . in group
i , one infant was diagnosed with compensated hypothyroidism . in our study , the results indicated a higher recall rate in newborn screening in infants of mother with thyroid problems although most of them returned to normal on followup .
the median tsh levels of mothers of the infants with hyperthyrotropinemia were also high indicating inadequate control of thyroid status during pregnancy .
in group i , the median tsh level of mothers was 5  miu / l which was higher than the recommended goal ( 2.5  miu / l ) ; undertreated hypothyroidism might had an additional negative effect on developing fetus .  
women with thyroid disorders should be followed closely throughout pregnancy for the prevention of obstetric complications , and their newborn infants should be followed closely in the first months of postnatal life for thyroid dysfunction .","1. Introduction

"electromyography ( emg ) allows evaluation of the masticatory system through record of muscular electrical current during resting , chewing and tooth clenching . the silent period ( sp )
represents a reduced electromyographic activity that induces voluntary muscular activity through magnetic transcranial stimulation in the primary motor cortex analyzed by emg . in the elevator muscles of the mandible
, the sp begins after functional dental contact or stimulus in the oral and periodontal region during muscular contraction .
thus , the sp can be induced by the release of sudden stress in the muscle , percussion on the chin , voluntary and rhythmic dental contact , and electrical stimulus .
the sp might be influenced by patient 's age as well as deficient occlusion , tooth loss , and emotional behavior .
some studies have suggested that the sp is an important factor for evaluation of neuropathies and motor deficiency .
the researchers demonstrated that the sp could be an auxiliary exam for diagnosis of functional disturbance as a correlation between period length and symptoms severity .
some previous studies also presented the influence of sexual hormones on the development of joint and muscular alterations .
the effect of estrogen on the masticatory system depends on the amount of estrogen receptors present in muscles and joints . in this sense
, some studies showed a difference on pain modulation during the menstrual cycle and in contraceptive users .
although there is a study about the electrical performance of masticatory muscles during the menstrual cycle was found , it did not mention sps of the muscles .
thus , the aim of this study was to evaluate the sp on masticatory cycle of two elevator muscles of the mandible during the menstrual cycle of dentate female patients using oral contraceptive ( oc ) or not .
the research hypothesis assumed that the sp on masticatory cycles would be different regarding muscles , ocs users and nonusers , and menstrual period .
amongst 342 female students of the araatuba dental school - so paulo state university - brazil , 30 women were selected after initial exam including anamnesis and clinical evaluation .
half of the sample was not taking any sexual hormone ( g1 ) while the other half ( g2 ) was using some type of hormone .
the inclusion criteria assumed female patients in reproductive age between 18 and 32 years old and also users and nonusers of some oc ( estrogen and/or progesterone hormones ) to avoid pregnancy , as confirmed by the volunteer 's physician .
the g1 patients should present regular menstrual cycles ( 28  3 days ) without taking ocs for at least 3 months .
the g2 patients were taking low - dose pills for at least 3 months in a cycle of 21 days for active medication followed by 7 days without active medication .
the exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders ( tmd ) , as confirmed by the dworkin and leresche research diagnostic criteria for tmd ; presence of systemic pathology ; pregnancy during the study ; more than one tooth loss in each quadrant ( excluding third molar ) ; orthodontic treatment ; presence of occlusal interference on the opposite side of mastication ; symptoms on muscle palpation ; and patients submitted to dental treatment including alteration of occlusion as well as prostheses and restorations .
the patients were informed about the experiment and signed an informed consent form in accordance with the recommendations of the committee on ethics in human research , which approved the study .
all female students were observed every week during three consecutive menstrual cycles and the exams initiated on the 1 day of the cycle of each month .
the menstrual cycle was divided into four distinct phases at 1 day of menstruation to 2 days after ( p1 ) , 7 day  2 days ( p2 ) , 14 day  2 days ( p3 ) and 21 day  2 days ( p4 ) .
women who were not on oc group predicted their ovulation using the clearplan ovulation prediction kit ( clearplan easy , unipath research , princeton , nj , us ) .
the emg was measured every week according to the menstrual cycle phases using bipolar surface electrodes ( bio research , redmond , wa , us ) with 10 mm in diameter .
a 21 mm interelectrode distance was determined and the electrodes were connected to an amplifier by cables that were attached to a computer using the bio research  bio emg 
the test was conducted at sampling rate of 1000 hz during 15 s using 1x amplification .
the electrodes were positioned based on palpation of the muscles at 1.52.0 cm superior to the zygomatic arch , immediately behind the frontal process of the zygomatic bone .
the evaluation was conducted bilaterally over dry skin parallel to the masseter and temporal muscle fibers .
the center part of the masseter muscle was localized at the point equidistant to the upper and lower insertions of the muscle with teeth in occlusal contact . for the temporal muscle , the anterior border was located during mandibular movement to place the electrode perpendicular to the sagittal plane .
this cycle is defined as a cycle when a subject firmly closes the mouth from the open mouth position with teeth in the habitual occlusal position during the chewing cycle .
each subject chewed the food for 35 cycles , which is very close to the moment of deglutition , and each cycle corresponded to the maximum bite chewing performed for each subject to grind the food .
sp measurements were obtained 3 times in each subject for each chewing cycle and the mean was calculated in milliseconds ( ms ) .
the sp length was measured using the double - zoom option with error about 1.2 ms .
the measurement considered the peak of the last significant spike preceding the inhibition to the peak of the first significant spike being part of the ongoing muscle activity . in case of sp with two or three inhibitory pauses ( double or triple sp ) or depressed muscle activity after complete inhibition of motor neurons , the length of all inhibitory pauses was measured or added to the duration of a depressed activity after the last inhibitory pause . during the sp records ,
the subjects were kept in a comfortable sitting position without headrest and with the frankfort horizontal plane parallel to the floor .
all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss version 19.0 statistical software ( spss inc . ,
the normality of sp values was assessed by shapiro - wilks w - test . a four - way repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova )
was performed to verify any significant difference regarding muscle , side , group , and period .
the means were compared by tukey honestly significant difference test (  = 0.05 ) post hoc test .

the means were compared by tukey honestly significant difference test (  = 0.05 ) post hoc test .
table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the sp values for each period of analysis .
table 2 shows the results of four - way repeated measures anova . although side and period statistically affected the sp values ( p = 0.03 , anova ) [ table 2 ] , there was no statistically significant difference on the interaction among the factors ( muscle  side  group  period ) ( p > 0.05 , anova ) [ table 2 ] . for the interaction between side and period ,
the sp values of the right side ( 13.49 ms ) were different from the left side ( 12.28 ms ) at p2 , regardless group and muscle ( p < 0.05 ) [ table 3 ] .
mean values ( sds ) of sp ( ms ) of the sample four - way repeated measures anova mean values ( sds ) of sp ( ms ) for each side and period , regardless group and muscle
electromyography has been used to evaluate muscular alterations considering that sp represents the functional state of the neuromuscular system .
the research hypothesis was partially accepted assuming the difference in sp between side and period of analysis .
found mean sp values between 12.5 and 12.9 ms in healthy individuals during tooth clenching .
showed mean sp from 9.21 to 11.5 ms in healthy patients during dental percussion and chewing while watt et al .
chewing is a complex and rhythmic physiological process of mandible that requires interaction between receptors and nerves to control bone , joints and muscles of the stomatognathic system . in the present study ,
the sp was evaluated through tooth contact during chewing considering the three steps of the chewing cycle ( open - close - clench ) .
it has been suggested that masseter presents the highest strength and electrical activity during food grinding . on the other hand ,
the temporal muscle is effective for the most accurate mandibular movements , such as laterality .
however , the present study did not find a significant difference between those muscles since the structural composition and functional characteristics may change as an adaptation to functional requirements . in this sense , some authors confirmed that strengthening and stretching exercises might cause alterations in muscular properties because of higher tolerance to stretching or biomolecular structural alterations that may change with gender .
it is important to emphasize that mastication may occur on both sides simultaneously or alternately , but it is important to consider that the majority of people chew more on one particular side that is , they have a preferred chewing side ( pcs )
. this preference may be influenced by occlusion , pain , hemispheric laterality and other factors .
chewing is an exercise for the muscles of mastication , and the preference for one side may stimulate this side more intensively .
although in the present study , preferred side of chewing of the voluntaries has not been determined , we could speculate that the difference between sides at p2 could be probably due to a stimulus generated by periodontal or muscular receptors important for sp .
furthermore , we can suppose that the hormonal alterations at p2 probably influenced the muscular activity during sp , the ocs did not affect the muscular function [ tables 2 and 3 ] .
in addition , it is important to consider the direct influence of occlusion on the masticatory standard considering the alterations in muscular contraction during food grinding . for the ocs
although the level of sexual hormones reduces during the menstrual cycle , especially estrogen , there was no significant difference between the group and the menstrual period [ table 2 ] .
in addition , additional factors such as stress , structural alterations in muscles and joint , occlusion and parafunctional habits also influence the physiopathology of the stomatognathic system in female patients .
according to the results of the present study , it was concluded that the physiological , hormonal alterations during the menstrual cycle in oc users and nonusers do not affect the sp in healthy patients .
there was no significant difference in the sp on masticatory cycle of muscles in contraceptive users and nonusers during the menstrual cycle of healthy patients .","INTRODUCTION

"circularly polarized 
 luminescence ( cpl ) spectroscopy is the counterpart of circular dichroism 
 ( cd ) in the characterization of emission .
while cd spectroscopy has been widely used to investigate structural 
 properties of the ground electronic states of a system , cpl has been 
 proven to be powerful in studying the structural properties of the 
 luminescent excited states . in some applications
, cpl provides additional 
 information concerning molecular dynamics and energetics by probing 
 processes that occur between the excitation event and the emission . in spite of the fact that there are still many 
 unresolved issues regarding the measurement and theoretical characterization
, 
 it is widely believed that cpl has great potential for the monitoring 
 of chiral environments due to its high sensitivity and specificity .
moreover , cpl also has potential applications 
 in photonic devices , such as light - emitting diodes , optical amplifiers , 
 and optical information storage .
so far , the research field of cpl has been dominated by chiral lanthanide 
 complexes .
the intraconfigurational f 
  f transitions from lanthanide metal ions , particularly those 
 that obey magnetic dipole selection rules ( j = 0 
  1 , except 0  0 ) , generally have large luminescence 
 dissymmetry factors , glum( ) , which facilitate the detection of the cpl signal .
however , in recent years , there has been a growing 
 interest in developing new cpl - active materials based on organic molecules 
 or transition - metal complexes .
various strategies have 
 been used to create cpl - emitting organic materials , including attaching 
 chiral side chains to conjugated polymers , embedding organic chromophores 
 in a chiral matrix , and developing inherently chiral conjugated molecules . 

the pinene group , a naturally occurring chiral element , is frequently 
 introduced into pyridine ligands , leading to novel helical configurations 
 and interesting circularly polarized luminescence .
cpl switches based on supramolecular systems are 
 particularly interesting because 
 cpl emission can be turned  
  off  by an external stimulus , including 
 anion or ion pairing , temperature , solvent polarity , concentration , 
 light irradiation , and mechanical stirring .
maeda et al . demonstrated that conformation changes by inversion 
 ( flipping ) of two pyrrole rings as a result of anion binding can control 
 the chiroptical properties of the anion receptors .
. showed that hydrogels with embedded rhodamine 
 b dye exhibited stir - induced circularly polarized luminescence , the 
 sense of which can be controlled by switching the stir direction from 
 clockwise ( cw ) to counterclockwise ( ccw ) with slow cooling from the 
 sol to gel states .
these cpl switches 
 may have potential applications for advanced chiroptical materials , 
 such as chiroptical memory , light - emitting devices , and multifunctional 
 sensors .
cyclometalated platinum(ii ) 
 complexes have long been the subject of intense investigation as luminescent 
 materials due to their intriguing stimulus - responsive structural and 
 spectroscopic properties .
moreover , cyclometalated platinum(ii ) complexes have 
 been proven to be biologically active as antitumor agents and dna 
 intercalators .
therefore , cyclometalated 
 platinum(ii ) complexes with cpl emission would be very useful in organic 
 light - emitting diodes ( oleds ) and chiral probes in biological systems . 
 however , cpl emission from platinum(ii ) complexes has seldom been 
 reported before , mainly due to the weak 
 chirality of the distorted square planar coordination configuration 
 of platinum(ii ) ion . in this work , we designed and synthesized a series 
 of chiral cyclometalated platinum(ii ) complexes , namely , [ pt(()-l1)(dmpi)]cl ( ( )-1 ) , [ pt((+)-l1)(dmpi)]cl ( ( + ) -1 ) , [ pt(()-l2)(dmpi)]cl 
 ( ( )-2 ) , [ pt((+)-l2)(dmpi)]cl ( ( + ) -2 ) , [ pt3(()-l2)2(dmpi)4](clo4)4 ( ( )-3 ) , 
 and [ pt3((+)-l2)2(dmpi)4](clo4)4 ( ( + ) -3 ) [ ( )-l1 = ( )-4,5-pinene-6-phenyl-2,2-bipyridine , 
 ( + ) -l1 = ( + ) -4,5-pinene-6-phenyl-2,2-bipyridine ) , 
 ( )-l2 = ( )-1,3-bis(2-(4,5-pinene)pyridyl)benzene , 
 ( + ) -l2 = ( + ) -1,3-bis(2-(4,5-pinene)pyridyl)benzene , dmpi 
 = 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide ] ( chart 1 ) . 
 in aqueous solutions , ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 aggregate into one - dimensional helical chain structures through 
 ptpt ,  , and hydrophobic
( )-3 and ( + ) -3 represent 
 a novel helical structure with pt  pt bonds .
cpl was observed from the aggregates of ( )-1 and 
 ( + ) -1 in water , as well as ( )-3 and 
 ( + ) -3 in dichloromethane . the cpl activity can be switched 
 reversibly ( for ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 ) 
 or irreversibly ( for ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 ) by varying the temperature .
these cpl - active materials based on 
 our chiral pt(ii ) complexes may have potential applications in photonic 
 devices or biosensors .
perchlorates 
 are potentially explosive and must be handled with great care and 
 in small amounts .
compounds ( )-l1 , ( + ) -l1 , ( )-l2 , ( + ) -l2 , pt(()-l1)cl , pt((+)-l1)cl , pt(()-l2)cl , 
 and pt((+)-l2)cl were prepared according to the methods 
 reported previously .
the nmr spectra were obtained 
 on a bruker drx-400 , drx-500 , or drx-600 spectrometer .
chemical shifts 
 are reported relative to ch3oh / cd3od ( (h ) = 3.31 ppm , (c ) = 49.0 ppm ) or ch2cl2/cd2cl2 ( (h ) = 5.32 ppm , (c ) = 53.8 ppm ) .
vis absorption spectra were 
 measured on a uv-3600 spectrophotometer ( using a 10 mm quartz cell 
 for a concentration of 5  10 moll , using a 1 mm quartz cell for concentrations of 5 
  10 and 5  10 moll ) .
the electronic circular dichroism ( ecd ) 
 spectra of the pt(ii ) complexes measured in aqueous , methanol , and/or 
 dichloromethane solutions were recorded on a jasco j-810 spectropolarimeter 
 ( using a 10 mm quartz cell for a concentration of 5  10 moll , using a 1 mm quartz 
 cell for concentrations of 5  10 and 5  
 10 moll ) .
the high - resolution 
 transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) images were obtained by employing 
 a jeol jem-2100 transmission electron microscope with an acceleration 
 voltage of 200 kv .
the scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images were 
 obtained on a hitachi s-4800 scanning electron microscope at 20 kv . 

x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) was carried out by a phi 5000 
 versaprobe ( u1vac - phi ) , and binding energies were measured relative 
 to the c 1s peak ( 284.8 ev ) of internal hydrocarbon . the resonance 
 light scattering ( rls ) spectra were obtained by synchronously scanning 
 the excitation and emission monochromators ( namely ,  
 = 0.0 nm ) of a hitachi f-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer in the 
 wavelength region from 300 to 800 nm .
cpl and total luminescence spectra 
 were recorded on an instrument described previously , operating in a differential photon - counting mode .
the light 
 source for excitation was a continuous wave 1000 w xenon arc lamp 
 from a spex fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer , equipped with excitation 
 and emission monochromators with a dispersion of 4 nm / mm ( spex , 1681b ) . 
 to prevent artifacts associated with the presence of linear polarization 
 in the emission ,
a high - quality linear 
 polarizer was placed in the sample compartment and aligned so that 
 the excitation beam was linearly polarized in the direction of emission 
 detection ( z - axis ) .
the key feature of this geometry 
 is that it ensures that the molecules that have been excited and that 
 are subsequently emitting are isotropically distributed in the plane 
 ( x , y ) perpendicular to the direction 
 of emission detection .
the optical system detection consisted of a 
 focusing lens , long - pass filter , and 0.22 m monochromator .
the emitted 
 light was detected by a cooled emi-9558b photomultiplier tube operating 
 in photocounting mode .
all measurements were performed with quartz 
 cuvettes with a path length of 1.0 cm . to a vigorously stirred solution of pt(()-l1)cl ( 1 mmol , 560 mg ) in 20 ml of dichloromethane precovered 
 by 40 ml of water
was added a small excess of 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide 
 ( 1.05 mmol , 138 mg ) dissolved in 8 ml of dichloromethane . after reaction 
 for 1 h at room temperature ,
the aqueous phase was separated , the 
 solvents were evaporated , and red powders were obtained ( 95% ) . the 
 pure product was obtained after several recrystallizations in meoh / h2o solution .

yellow 
 needles of complex ( )-1 were grown in acetonitrile / dichloromethane 
 ( 1/1 , v / v ) solution at room temperature .
yellow rods of racemic 2-otf were obtained by diffusion of diethyl ether into the 
 acetonitrile solution of a mixture of ( )-2-otf 
 and ( + ) -2-otf at room temperature , whereas green - yellow 
 blocks of complexes ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 were isolated by recrystallization in the chloroform solution at 
 273 k. moreover , the green - yellow crystal ( )-3 ( a different polymorph of ( )-3 ) can be obtained 
 by evaporation of a mixed methanol / cd2cl2 ( 1/1 , 
 v / v ) solution at 273 k. because of the poor diffracting ability of 
 the very small needle crystal , the structure determination of ( )-1 is unsatisfactory , but it does provide accurate connectivity 
 and packing information as well as valid bond distances and angles 
 involving the heavy atoms in the structure . single - crystal x - ray diffraction 
 measurements were carried out on a bruker smart apex charge - coupled 
 device ( ccd)-based diffractometer operating at room temperature .
intensities 
 were collected with graphite - monochromatized mo k radiation 
 (  = 0.71073  ) operating at 50 kv and 30 ma using the 
 /2 scan mode .
the structures were solved by direct methods and refined on f by full - matrix least - squares using shelxl-97 
 with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non - hydrogen atoms 
 in all structures .
hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atoms were 
 placed in calculated positions and refined in the riding mode , with 
 c  h = 0.93  ( methane ) or 0.96  ( methyl ) and uiso(h ) = 1.2ueq(cmethane ) or uiso(h ) = 1.5ueq(cmethyl ) .
the water hydrogen atoms 
 were located in the difference fourier maps and refined with an o 
h 
 distance restraint [ 0.85(1 )  ] and uiso(h ) = 1.5ueq(o ) .
these data can be obtained free 
 of charge from the cambridge crystallographic data centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif .
the precursors pt(()-l1)cl and pt(()-l2)cl were prepared according to 
 the methods reported previously . complexes 
 ( )-1 and ( )-2 can be obtained 
 through ligand metathesis reaction of pt(()-l1)cl 
 and pt(()-l2)cl with 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide 
 at room temperature .
the unprecedented 
 pair of trimeric helical complexes ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 were isolated at 273 k when excess 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide 
 was reacted with complexes ( )-2 and ( + ) -2 , followed by addition of excess agclo4 aqueous 
 solution .
compounds ( + ) -1 , ( + ) -2 , and ( + ) -3 were obtained with the same procedures as for ( )-1 , ( )-2 , and ( )-3 , respectively . all the complexes (
( )-1 , ( )-2 , and ( )-3 ) have been fully characterized 
 by elemental analysis , nmr , xps , and esi mass spectrometry ( figures 
 s1s22 , supporting information ) . except ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 ,
the h nmr spectra of ( )-1 show broadening 
 and upfield shifts in the mixed solution of cd3od and d2o ( figure 1 ) , suggesting the presence 
 of molecular association through ptpt ,  , 
 and hydrophobic  hydrophobic interactions when d2o was added .

( )-3 and ( + ) -3 are very 
 stable in the solid state but partially decompose in dichloromethane 
 solution at room temperature . as shown in figure 2 , complex ( )-3 starts to partially decompose 
 at 293 k and turns into complex ( )-2 , as evidenced 
 by additional peaks at ca . 8.30 , 1.48 , and 0.76 ppm after decomposition . 

therefore , all the spectroscopic data of ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 were measured at 273 k except where otherwise 
 noted .

complex ( )-1 crystallizes in the p21 space 
 group of the monoclinic system ( table 1 ) .
two 
 isolated molecules are included in the asymmetrical unit of complex 
 ( )-1 ( figure 3a ) .
n ( 1.912.12 
  ) ( table s1 , supporting information ) bond lengths and relevant angles are in the typical ranges for 
 pt(c^n^n ) isocyanide complexes ( c^n^n denoted as ( )-l1 ) .
the rings of 2,6-dimethylphenyl 
 isocyanide are almost coplanar with the pt(c^n^n ) unit , with dihedral 
 angles between the two planes of 2.93 and 3.94. the molecules 
 are further slip - stacked in head - to - head mode along the a axis with effective  contacts ( 3.379  ) 
 ( figure 3b ) .
the ptpt distances between adjacent 
 pt atoms are 3.812 and 4.129  , respectively , indicating that 
 no ptpt interactions are involved .

h atoms , solvent molecules , and anions are 
 omitted for clarity , and the percentage of thermal ellipsoid probability 
 is 30% .
attempts to grow single crystals for ( )-2 and 
 ( + ) -2 were not successful .
however , we were able to obtain 
 a racemic crystal of 2-otf by substituting the cl with 
 otf . as shown in figure s25 ( supporting information ) , the coordination environment of pt(ii ) atoms in 2-otf is very similar to that of ( )-1 , showing 
 a slightly distorted square - planar configuration .
however , the torsion 
 angle ( 17.33 ) between the ring of 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide 
 and the pt(n^c^n ) plane in 2-otf is more salient relative 
 to that of ( )-1 ( n^c^n denoted as ( )-l2 ) . in the packing diagram of 2-otf , two isolated 
 molecules ( ( )-2 and ( + ) -2 cations 
 appear alternately ) are slip - stacked in head - to - tail mode along the c axis ( figure s26 , supporting information ) .
owing to the steric hindrance of pinene groups in 2-otf , the neighbor molecules could not approach each other closely 
 in a face - to - face manner and the nearest ptpt distance 
 is 6.01  , suggesting that neither distinct ptpt 
 nor  interactions are present .
the crystals of ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 recrystallized in chcl3 at 273 k reside in the p21212 space group of the orthorhombic 
 system ( table 1 ) . in the trimeric structure 
 of (
)-3 , two pt ions ( top and bottom ) coordinate 
 with two carbon atoms of 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide and one carbon 
 atom and one nitrogen atom of the n^c^n ligands .
these two pt ions 
 are bridged by the central pt ion , which is coordinated to nitrogen 
 atoms of the n^c^n ligands ( figure 3c ) .
the 
 coordination number of the top and bottom pt ions ( pt1 and pt1a in 
 figure 3c ) is five , and both of them exhibit 
 the distorted tetragonal pyramid geometry , while the coordination 
 environment of the central pt ion ( pt2 in figure 3c ) with four - coordinate atoms is a distorted square - planar 
 geometry . for the same n^c^n ligand
, one side pyridine ring presents 
 a twist of 44.63 relative to the central benzene plane , and 
 the configuration of such torsion is suited to coordinate to pt2 ( figure 3c ) .
in addition , the two pyridine rings coordinated 
 to the central pt ion ( pt2 ) show a significant twisted angle of 71.85. 
 the two chiral n^c^n ligands are thus wrapped around the pt ions in 
 a helical fashion . the pt 
pt bond distances ( dpt1pt2 and dpt1a  pt2 ) are both 2.886  , which is significantly less than the sum 
 of van der waals radii ( 3.4  ) of two pt atoms and indicates 
 the presence of a pt 
furthermore , pt1pt2pt1a 
 deviates significantly from a linear geometry with a bond angle of 
 158.47. as manifested in the molecular packing diagram ( figure 
 s27 , supporting information ) , no significant 
 intermolecular interactions were observed for ( )-3 in virtue of great steric hindrance of neighboring trinuclear molecules . 

complex ( + ) -3 exhibits a mirror structure to that of 
 ( )-3 , in accordance with their enantiomeric nature 
 ( figure 3c ) . by using different crystallization 
 solvents ( mixed methanol / cd2cl2 solution ) , a 
 different polymorph of ( )-3 was obtained ( denoted 
 as ( )-3 ) .
the molecular structure of 
 ( )-3 is essentially identical to that 
 of ( )-3 ( figure s28 , supporting 
 information ) .
the trimetallic molecule of ( )-3 displays a similar helical configuration , with the 
 pt  pt bond length being 2.875  and the pt 
 pt 
 angle being 160.74. however , the angle of molecular arrangement 
 in the ab plane in ( )-3 is different from that of ( )-3 ( 64.23 
 for ( )-3 and 53.39 for ( )-3 , as shown in figure s27 and figure s28 ) .
moreover , 
 as compared to ( )-3 , the molecules are more compact 
 along the b axis in ( )-3 ( figure s27 and figure s28 ) , which can also be reflected by the 
 difference in their cell lengths .
the uv  vis absorption spectra 
 of ( )-1 , ( + ) -1 , ( )-2 , ( + ) -2 , ( )-3 , and ( + ) -3 are shown in figure 4 , and spectroscopic 
 data are summarized in table s2 ( supporting information ) .
all these complexes exhibit characteristic absorption bands for 
 typical cyclometalated platinum(ii ) complexes , i.e. , intraligand ( il ) 
 transitions (  > 10 lmolcm ) in the region of 200310 nm 
 and metal - to - ligand charge transfer ( mlct ) mixed with ligand - to - ligand 
 charge transfer ( llct ) transitions (  > 10 lmolcm ) in the region of 330450 
 nm .
( )-1 ( in meoh ) and 
 ( )-2 and ( )-3 ( in dichloromethane ) 

are emissive at room temperature ( figure s29s30 , table s2 , supporting information ) .
the high - energy emissive 
 state of ( )-1 in methanol solution ( em = 521 nm ) can be assigned to the combination of mlct and llct excited states , while the highly structured emission spectra of ( )-2 and ( )-3 can be mainly assigned as 
 the ligand - centered  * state .
the profiles of emission spectra of complexes ( )-2 and ( )-3 are similar in dichloromethane solution 
 ( figure s30 ) , indicating that the presence of pt 
pt bonds in 
 ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 does not change the 
 nature of the frontier orbitals .
( a ) uv  vis absorption and ecd spectra 
 of ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 in meoh and h2o at 5  10 moll . ( b ) uv  vis absorption and ecd spectra of ( )-2 and ( + ) -2 in dichloromethane at 5  10 moll ( 294 k ) and ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 in dichloromethane at 2.5  
 10 moll ( 273 k ) .
when ( )-1 was dissolved in water , the absorption intensity in the range of 
 200380 nm decreased while a new low - energy absorption in the 
 range of 420550 nm emerged with increasing h2o 
 content , resulting from different degrees of aggregation in mixed 
 solvents with various ratios ( figure 5 ) .
one 
 clear isosbestic point at 366 nm can be distinguished , indicating 
 a clean conversion between the nonaggregate state and aggregate species . 

the color difference of the solution can intuitively reflect the aggregation 
 process ( figure 6 ) . as the content of h2o increased , the color of the solution changed from pale yellow 
 to orange .
the orange solution can be attributed to formation of aggregate 
 species though ptpt ,  , and 
 hydrophobic  hydrophobic interactions . as a consequence
, the 
 absorption at around 500 nm is assigned to a metal  metal - to - ligand 
 charge transfer ( mmlct ) transition . when 
 excited at 420 nm , a low - energy emission ( em = 640 
 nm ) was observed ( figure s29 , supporting information ) in aqueous solution which can be attributed to the mmlct excited state .
as expected , the 
 excitation spectra exhibited an emergence of a low - energy band with 
 increasing content of h2o , which is in line with a mmlct transition of the absorption spectra ( figure s29 ) .
the 
 uv  vis absorption and photoluminescence of ( )-1 with various concentrations in aqueous solution have also 
 been carried out ( figure s31 and figure s32 , supporting 
 information ) . within the concentration range of 5  10 to 5  10 moll ,
only a small change of the extinction coefficient 
 was found , suggesting that well - defined aggregates have formed even 
 in the diluted solution and therefore the aggregation is insensitive 
 to concentration changes .
similar observations have been reported 
 in the previous work that cyclometalated platinum(ii ) complexes can 
 oligomerize in water even at a dilution of 2  10 moll . similarly , 

the emission spectra of ( )-1 in water were concentration - independent , 
 and the emission maximum remained at 640 nm .
 vis absorption 
 and ecd spectra and gabs factors of ( )-1 ( 5  10 moll ) in a mixed solution of meoh and h2o in the ratios shown .
photograph of ( )-1 ( 10 moll ) in a mixed solution 
 of meoh and h2o in the ratios shown ( under ambient light ) . this solvent - induced aggregation 
 of ( )-1 was further evidenced by the enhanced 
 signal of rls spectra ( figure s33 , supporting 
 information ) . upon increasing the h2o
content , the 
 intensity of the rls signal in the range from 350 to 600 nm was significantly 
 strengthened , indicating the formation of aggregates in the solution 
 and therefore the chromophores were strongly coupled . as shown in figure 7 , the 
 aggregation of ( )-1 is also sensitive to temperature . 
 upon increasing the temperature , the absorption peak at 460 nm associated 
 with the mmlct transition shows a slight drop in intensity ; concomitantly 
 the peaks at 350 and 250 nm related to the mlct / llct transition become 
 more intense .
an isosbestic point can be found at 366 nm , resembling 
 the solvent - induced absorption variance .
these changes can be ascribed 
 to the attenuation of ptpt and  
 interactions at higher temperature , leading to the deaggregation of 
 the molecules .
the emission intensity 
 also presents a drastic drop , and the emission maximum has a slight 
 blue shift upon increasing the temperature ( figure s34 , supporting information ) , which further corroborates 
 the deaggregation of molecules .
 vis 
 absorption and ecd spectra and gabs factors 
 of ( )-1 in h2o at 5  10 moll with different temperatures .
the uv  vis absorption spectra 
 and emission spectra of ( )-3 measured at different 
 temperatures above 273 k show a continuous variance due to decomposition 
 ( figure s35 and s36 , supporting information ) .
as shown in figure s35 , when the temperature changes from 273 
 to 294 k , the absorbance at 394 nm decreases , while the absorptions 
 of the peaks at 331 and 291 nm increase .
although the emission maximum 
 of ( )-3 shows a small change upon increasing 
 the temperature , the emission intensity of the shoulder peak at 525 
 nm exhibits a distinct drop ( figure s36 ) .
figure 4 shows the ecd spectra of ( )-1 , ( + ) -1 , ( )-2 , ( + ) -2 , ( )-3 , and ( + ) -3 .
the ecd spectrum 
 of ( )-1 shows moderate cotton effects ( positive , 
 240 , 284 , and 346 nm ; negative , 303 nm ) in methanol solution ; however , 
 a significantly different and enhanced ecd spectrum ( positive , 250 , 
 300 , 370 , and 480 nm ; negative , 320 and 420 nm ) was observed in water . 

the anisotropy gabs factor becomes higher with increasing h2o content ( figure 5 ) , and it reaches + 0.0022 at 377 nm and 0.0046 
 at 420 nm in pure aqueous solution , which are 1 order of magnitude 
 larger than those of the methanol solution at the corresponding wavelengths . 
 owing to the dissociation of molecules upon increasing the temperature , 
 the chiral signals of ( )-1 in water solution 
 decrease upon increasing the temperature of the sample from 298 to 
 353 k ( figure 7 ) . when monitored at 370 nm , the chiral signals of ( )-1 can be reversibly tuned by changing the temperature , and 
 no distinct degeneration can be found , indicating the persistence 
 of temperature - induced ecd switching ( figure 8) .
in addition , concentration - dependent ecd spectra of ( )-1 in aqueous solution have been obtained ( figure s31 , supporting information ) . the ecd signals and 
 anisotropy gabs factors were virtually 
 unchanged upon increasing the concentration , suggesting that well - ordered 
 aggregates were formed in the diluted aqueous solution .
therefore , 
 the chiral environment of ( )-1 is solvent and 
 temperature dependent but insensitive to the concentration in water .
reversible 
 process of temperature - induced ecd switching ( monitored at 370 nm ) 
 of ( )-1 . the ecd spectrum of ( )-2 in a dichloromethane 
 solution shows weak positive cotton effects at 330 and 255 nm and 
 a weak negative cotton effect at 307 nm ( figure 4b ) .
however , the ecd spectrum of ( )-3 exhibits 
 two extremely intense bands at 350 and 395 nm in addition to the series 
 of cotton effects in the range of 250320 nm ( figure 4b ) . the gabs factor of ( )-3 is 0.0026 
 at 346 nm and + 0.0071 at 401 nm , which are about 15 times larger than 
 those of ( )-2 at the corresponding wavelengths . 
 the intensity of the cotton effect of ( )-3 decreases 
 upon increasing the temperature from 273 to 294 k owing to decomposition 
 ( figure s35 , supporting information ) . the significant enhancement of chirality of ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 from meoh to h2o solutions , and 
 from ( )-2 and ( + ) -2 to ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 , could be elucidated from their structural 
 changes . for ( )-1 and ( + )
-1 in meoh 
 solutions , the molecules are dissociated and the chirality of the 
 slightly distorted square - planar complexes is rather weak . when ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 are dissolved in water , the molecules 
 are inclined to aggregate into one - dimensional chain structures through 
 ptpt ,  , and hydrophobic 
hydrophobic 
 interactions , as already reported in the literature and also evidenced by the appearance of an mmlct in the 
 absorption and emission spectra . due to the steric hindrance of the 
 bulky pinene groups in ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 , the adjacent molecules have to be staggered from each other alongside 
 the ptpt chain , thus forming a helix and enhancing 
 the chiral environment .
increasing the temperature disrupts the helical 
 aggregation and subsequently results in a less pronounced chiral environment . 

as a consequence , the strong ecd signals of ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 in water should come from helical chirality 
 of aggregated chromophores rather than intrinsic chirality of the 
 separated molecules .
intermolecular ptpt ,  , 
 and hydrophobic  hydrophobic interactions can be strengthened 
 or weakened by variations of the solvent ( meoh / h2o ) ratios 
 and temperature , producing aggregates of ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 with different helicity degrees and resulting 
 in different ecd signals . for ( )-3 and ( + )
-3 , the helical structures , which enhance the chiroptical activity , 
 have been revealed by the single - crystal x - ray diffraction studies . according to the temperature
/ solvent - induced variance 
 of chirality in the ground state as evidenced in the ecd spectra , 
 the chiral signals were enhanced through formation of an intramolecular 
 helical structure or intermolecular helical aggregation .
therefore , 
 we envision that interesting cpl activity in the corresponding excited 
 state would be present .
therefore , the cpl spectra of ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 were measured in 1 mm meoh and h2o solutions , whereas the cpl spectra of ( )-2 , ( + ) -2 , ( )-3 , and ( + ) -3 were measured in 1 mm dichloromethane solutions . although ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 in meoh solutions and ( )-2 and ( + ) -2 in dichloromethane solutions did 
 not exhibit any cpl activity at 295 k , we were able to observe a measurable 
 cpl activity for ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 in 
 aqueous solutions at 295 k , as well as for ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 in dichloromethane solutions at 278 k ( figure 9 ) .
the glum(6 ) values around the maximum emission wavelength 
 are 0.0018/+0.0012 for ( )-1/(+)-1 at 295 k and + 0.0024/0.0024 for ( )-3/(+)-3 at 278 k , respectively .
interestingly , 
 the cpl activity was lost for aqueous solutions of ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 at 353 k ( no conclusive cpl signal 
 was detected ; the data points are scattered and non - mirror - symmetric ) 
 ( figure s37 , supporting information ) but 
 can be recovered upon cooling to 295 k. the cpl activity of the meoh 
 solution of ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 was weakened 
 at 295 k ( glum = + 0.0016/0.0016 ) 
 as compared to that at 278 k ( figure s37 ) , in agreement with the above - mentioned 
 observation that part of the helical trinuclear complexes were decomposed 
 into mononuclear complexes with weak chirality upon increasing the 
 temperature .

 spectra of ( a ) ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 ( left 
 panel ) in 1 mm aqueous solutions at 295 k and ( b ) ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 ( right panel ) in 1 mm dichloromethane 
 solutions at 278 k. it is noteworthy that , 
 although cpl signals of platinum(ii ) complexes have been reported 
 recently , the pt atom is not the stereogenic 
 center in these systems , and the cpl activity comes from the helical 
 organic luminophore .
however , in our study , the pt atoms play a key 
 role in the formation of helical aggregations or helical structures , 
 which control the circularly polarized luminescent behavior of the 
 chiral platinum(ii ) complexes .
the asymmetric centers on the pinene 
 groups are remote from the metal atom and have little direct effect 
 on the cpl spectra , but they could have an influence on chiral coordination 
 or the helical arrangement , causing measurable cpl signals .
we have 
 also observed the cpl - active mmlct excited state , which 
 is unprecedented in the literature to the best of our knowledge .
moreover , 
 we demonstrated a very novel temperature - dependent tuning of the cpl 
 activity .
in conclusion , two chiral 
 cyclometalated platinum(ii ) complexes , [ pt(()-l1)(dmpi)]cl ( ( )-1 ) and [ pt((+)-l1)(dmpi)]cl 
 ( ( + ) -1 ) , and [ pt(()-l2)(dmpi)]cl ( ( )-2 ) and [ pt((+)-l2)(dmpi)]cl ( ( + ) -2 ) , have been synthesized and characterized .
( )-1 and ( + ) -1 aggregated in water via ptpt ,  , and hydrophobic 
( )-2 and ( + ) -2 reacted 
 with excess 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide to give the trimetallic 
 helical complexes [ pt3(()-l2)2(dmpi)4](clo4)4 ( ( )-3 ) and [ pt3((+)-l2)2(dmpi)4](clo4)4 ( ( + ) -3 ) . significant 
 enhancement and/or alteration of chirality was observed for ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 in aqueous solutions and ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 , as revealed in the ecd spectroscopic 
 study .
the enhancement and/or alternation of chirality for ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 in aqueous solutions and ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 led to a detectable cpl activity 
 for these platinum(ii ) complexes .
more interestingly , the cpl activity 
 can be switched reversibly ( for ( )-1 and ( + ) -1 ) or irreversibly ( for ( )-3 and ( + ) -3 ) due to deaggregation or decomposition upon increasing the 
 temperature .
extension of this work to other chiral luminescent pt(ii ) 
 complexes and studies aimed at utilizing these complexes in photonic 
 devices or biosensors are under way and will be reported in due course .","Introduction

"acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( acheis ) are the primary pharmacologic treatment for alzheimer s disease ( ad ) .
these medications do not alter the natural course of the disease , but they are believed to offer minor improvement in cognitive , functional , and behavioral symptoms associated with ad.1,2 efficacy of the acheis may be modified by several factors , including stage of dementia , rate of cognitive decline , medication dose , and titration schedule.1,3 adverse effects related to their procholinergic mechanisms often limit the tolerability of these medications , with nearly a third of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects such as nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea.1 because of the marginal benefit and adverse effect profile , as many as 40% of ad patients discontinue treatment with acheis.46 two factors that may contribute to the tolerability of acheis in ad patients are drug  drug interactions and pharmacogenomics . because of the frequent burden of chronic comorbid disease in the older adult population , many ad patients are routinely prescribed at least five medications , and consume additional over - the - counter medications.7,8 many of these coadministered medications cause drug interactions either through altering the activities of the hepatic drug - metabolizing enzymes9 or by pharmacodynamic properties suspected to limit the efficacy of acheis.10,11 recent evidence highlights the mechanisms of drug interactions resulting from altered pharmacokinetics through hepatic metabolism.12 the specific enzymes involved in the metabolism of medications used in ad , specifically donepezil and galantamine , are cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) 2d6 and 3a4/3a5 ( cyp3a4/5 ) enzymes.13,14 the metabolism of donepezil and galantamine may be influenced by either pharmacogenomic variants or comedications , and these variables may be used to identify those at higher risk of intolerable adverse effects .
pharmacogenomic variants have been associated with altered pharmacokinetics of donepezil and galantamine.1517 consequently , both comedications , as well as genetic variations in the drug - metabolizing enzymes , may be important factors contributing to the interindividual variability in the efficacy and tolerability of acheis .
prior literature has reported conflicting results when determining the relationship between genetic variations and efficacy outcomes with acheis in ad;1821 however , to our knowledge , no published data have described the influence of both pharmacogenomic variants or drug  drug interactions on efficacy or tolerability outcomes.15 our objective in this study was to determine the frequency of pharmacogenomic variants and potential drug interactions that may influence the pharmacokinetics of acheis , and ultimately efficacy and tolerability , in older adults with ad .
using cyp2d6 enzyme activity to guide dosing strategies has been shown to improve tolerability with several medications , including antidepressants and antipsychotics.22 personalizing pharmacotherapy could be an approach to improve medication adherence by optimizing efficacy and improving tolerability profiles .
we focused on the metabolic factors that are expected to alter medication exposure for donepezil and galantamine , since both are metabolized by hepatic cyp2d6 and cyp3a4/5 enzymes .
we hypothesized that the presence of a high frequency of pharmacogenomic variants and drug interactions for acheis would support the need to pursue focused approaches to personalize pharmacotherapy and optimize efficacy - to - toxicity ratios for these vulnerable populations .
the subjects included in this study were the first 105 subjects enrolled in a multisite randomized clinical trial ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier : nct01362686 ) to compare the tolerability of acheis in older adults with a diagnosis of ad.23 the study enrolled patients cared for in a memory care practice from one of four health care systems within the indianapolis discovery network for dementia.24 the study was approved by the institutional review boards for each health care system , including indiana university 
purdue university of indianapolis , the st vincent health system , and the community health network .
eligible participants included those diagnosed with possible or probable ad for whom the provider was planning to initiate therapy with acheis .
inclusion criteria also required agreement from an informal caregiver to complete study - outcome assessments , access to a telephone , and the ability to understand english .
exclusion criteria consisted of current exposure to an achei or prior exposure that resulted in an adverse effect requiring drug discontinuation .
caregivers were asked to provide all medications the participant was taking at the time of the interview , including all prescription and over - the - counter medications .
medications were classified as prescription or over the counter by a clinical pharmacist ( nlc ) according to marketing status , as approved by the us food and drug administration .
medications with cyp enzyme inhibitor or inducer status were identified using the indiana university department of clinical pharmacology drug - interaction table.9 this resource has been previously used to identify clinically relevant drug interactions and metabolic pathways.25 only medications identified as strong or moderate inhibitors were classified as enzyme inhibitors .
additionally , medications were identified to have either possible or definite anticholinergic properties based on the anticholinergic cognitive burden ( acb ) scale.26 medications with anticholinergic properties block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors , opposing the intended therapeutic effect of the acheis .
medications with possible anticholinergic effects were defined as those with serum anticholinergic activity or in vitro affinity to muscarinic receptors , but with no known clinically relevant negative cognitive effects ( score of 1 on the acb scale ) .
drugs with established and clinically relevant cognitive anticholinergic effects were considered definite anticholinergics ( score of 2 or 3 on the acb scale ) .
the acb scale has been previously used to identify medications correlated with a higher risk of incident cognitive impairment.27,28 blood samples for genotyping were collected in 10 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid vacutainer tubes at the time of enrollment into the study .
deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) was extracted from whole blood using the autogenflex star automated dna extractor ( autogen , holliston , ma , usa ) using the agf flexigene and blood dna finishing kit ( autogen ) in the indiana university sample - storage facility dna - extraction service .
because polymorphic variants are infrequent in cyp3a4/5 , we analyzed the cyp2d6 gene variants and not the cyp3a4/5 variants .
the cyp2d6 genotypes were determined for alleles cyp2d6 * 1 , * 2 , * 3 , * 4 , * 5 , * 6 , * 10 , * 17 , * 29 , and * 41 using taqman assays.29 the genotyping results for each subject were converted to predicted cyp2d6-activity scores as previously described.30 briefly , each subject s activity score is the sum of the activities assigned to each of the subject s two alleles .
the wild - type full - activity alleles ( * 1 , * 2 ) were given a score of 1 each , the reduced function alleles ( * 10 , * 17 , * 29 , * 41 ) were given a score of 0.5 , and the nonfunctional alleles ( * 3 , * 4 , * 5 , * 6 ) were given a score of 0 . in the case of subjects with multiple copies ( more than two ) ,
the multiple - copy allele was multiplied by two and then added to the second * allele .
if the subjects were taking a moderate cyp2d6 inhibitor , their genetic score was multiplied by 0.5 , and if they were taking a strong inhibitor , they were given a score of 0 to arrive at the predicted cyp2d6-activity score .
we report descriptive results of the population for the purposes of reporting frequencies of pharmacogenomic variants and drug interactions from concurrent medications that are expected to influence the ad drug pharmacokinetics in this population of older adults with ad .
continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations , with categorical variables presented in percentages .
because our analysis was not focused on the number or type of comorbidities , but rather the number of concomitant medications used by study subjects , we report the number of prescription and over - the - counter medications as a surrogate marker of comorbidity.31

in the case of subjects with multiple copies ( more than two ) , the multiple - copy allele was multiplied by two and then added to the second * allele .
therefore , the predicted cyp2d6-activity scores ranged from 0 to 3 . if the subjects were taking a moderate cyp2d6 inhibitor , their genetic score was multiplied by 0.5 , and if they were taking a strong inhibitor , they were given a score of 0 to arrive at the predicted cyp2d6-activity score .

the study population included the first 105 subjects enrolled in the clinical trial for whom we had both medication data and pharmacogenomic genotyping results available for analysis .
the subjects were mostly female ( 72% ) , were mixed in educational level ( 28% with less than high school education ) , and had a diverse racial background ( 36% african americans ) .
the population used a mean of approximately eight medications per day , including both prescription and over - the - counter medications .
forty - four ( 41.9% ) of the subjects were taking at least nine concurrent medications .
only 8% of subjects cared for in memory care practices used a medication with strong anticholinergic properties ( table 1 ) .
pharmacogenomic analysis revealed four subjects ( 3.8% ) with a cyp2d6-activity score of 0 , predicting poor metabolizer phenotypes with no cyp2d6 metabolic activity .
forty - three subjects ( 40.9% ) had activity scores of 0.5 or 1.0 , predicting intermediate metabolizer phenotypes .
fifty - four subjects ( 51.4% ) had activity scores of 1.5 or 2.0 , predicting extensive metabolizers , and the remaining four subjects ( 3.8% ) had activity scores greater than 2.0 , predicting ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes .
the specific cyp2d6 allele frequencies and hardy  weinberg values are available in table s1 .
results of the medication review showed that 19 subjects ( 18.1% ) were using a medication considered a moderate or strong inhibitor of cyp2d6 , and eight subjects ( 7.6% ) were taking a medication considered a moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4/5 .
eleven subjects ( 10.5% ) were users of a moderate or strong inhibitor of cyp2d6 that reduced activity scores to poor metabolizer status ( table 2 ) .
the majority of the cyp2d6 inhibitors used were sertraline and duloxetine , both considered moderate inhibitors of the cyp2d6 enzyme ( tables 2 and s2 ) . the major inhibitor of cyp3a4/5 used by the study subjects was diltiazem , a moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4/5 ( tables 2 and s2 ) .
additionally , 34.3% were using at least one cyp2d6 substrate , and 59.0% were using at least one cyp3a4/5 substrate ( table s2 ) .
because hepatically metabolized acheis utilize both the cyp2d6 and cyp3a4/5 metabolic pathways , we quantified the number of subjects with reduced activity of either cyp2d6 or cyp3a4/5 due to either pharmacogenomic characteristics or concomitant medications acting as moderate or strong enzyme inhibitors .
our results indicate that approximately 29% of our study population would have reduced activity of either cyp2d6 or cyp3a4/5 activity due to either pharmacogenomic variants or concomitant medications ( table 2 ) .
two of the subjects ( 1.9% ) were predicted to have reduced activity of both cyp2d6 and cyp3a4/5 ( table 2 ) .
our study found that more than a quarter of our ad patients ( ~29% ) were poor metabolizers of acheis , due to pharmacogenomic variants or the presence of drug  drug interactions .
these findings may partially explain the high rate of adverse events limiting the chronic use of acheis .
the population included in this analysis represented a real - world sample of older adults enrolled from four health care systems , including a low - income safety - net health care system .
the sample reflects a more normal distribution of educational status and racial diversity than what is commonly enrolled in ad studies conducted within purely academic medical centers and ad research centers .
therefore , the suggestion that both pharmacogenomic characteristics and concomitant medications may contribute to differences in tolerability of acheis should apply to the majority of the us population with dementia . in our sample ,
the number of participants using a medication that reduced hepatic enzyme activity was two times higher than the number of subjects with pharmacogenomic causes for reduced enzyme activity .
recent work in older adults with ad has shown conflicting results on the association of pharmacogenomic characteristics with clinical efficacy of acheis.20,21 the sources of variability in previously published literature are derived from different durations of treatment , definitions of efficacy outcomes , and populations with varying degrees of disease severity .
the majority of the work associating pharmacogenomic characteristics with clinical outcomes in ad have focused on the efficacy of acheis , not tolerability.14,20,21 whether the activity of cyp2d6 enzymes has an impact on efficacy remains an important outcome to determine ; however , we believe tolerability should also be pursued as an important clinical outcome . as stated in the background section , a clinically significant number of patients prescribed acheis discontinue these medications , in part because of poor tolerability . among those categorized as poor metabolizers , and perhaps even intermediate metabolizers , higher serum concentrations of acheis
may be more likely to induce an adverse effect than any therapeutic benefit of the medication . whether clinical efficacy is improved with higher serum concentrations
remains controversial , but improving tolerability may result in improved medication adherence and better efficacy outcomes .
our findings that nearly 30% of older adults with ad may be poor metabolizers of two acheis should be validated with adverse - event data in clinical trials .
we were not able to include clinical correlation with tolerability , because the clinical trial is ongoing and adverse events are a primary study outcome .
future studies and analyses from existing data sets should correlate pharmacogenomic and drug interactions with tolerability outcomes .
our results suggest that if exposure definitions only consider pharmacogenomic characteristics , personalized approaches to the prescribing of acheis ( specifically donepezil and galantamine ) may be improved by genotyping hepatic enzyme activity in approximately one in 12 individuals to find those with reduced activity of the cyp2d6 enzyme ( activity score 0 or 0.5 ) .
however , considering the influence that both concomitant medications and pharmacogenomic characteristics may have on hepatic enzyme activity , nearly one in three older adults may benefit from a personalized approach to medication selection .
interestingly , the predominant influence on enzyme activity seen in our population was with the cyp2d6 enzyme , not the cyp3a4/5 enzyme , which has less influence on the metabolism of donepezil and galantamine.15,16 in our sample , 42% were using at least nine medications , and the risk of drug interactions is known to increase with the number of medications consumed,32 which further increases the risk of adverse events in this population .
only 8% used a medication with strong anticholinergic activity , a similar rate to that reported from other specialty care practices.33 gardette et al found that concomitant use of anticholinergic agents increased the likelihood of discontinuation of acheis ( hazard ratio 4.26 , 95% ci 1.4612.45).33 although anticholinergics are known to cause a pharmacodynamic interaction , potentially limiting efficacy , some commonly used anticholinergics are also cyp2d6 enzyme inhibitors ( paroxetine , hydroxyzine , diphenhydramine ) that may also increase the risk of adverse effects of those acheis metabolized through this pathway.9 limitations to our findings include a small sample size and the collection of medication data using a caregiver report .
although our sample reflects more diversity than many prior studies in dementia , a larger sample size may improve generalizability . among patients with dementia ,
assistance with medication adherence by a caregiver is recommended ; therefore , using the caregiver report of medication utilization is a more appropriate resource for medication utilization than self - report .
although no gold standard exists for the evaluation of medication use , self - reporting and possibly caregiver reporting of medication use may overestimate actual medication - administration behavior .
it is unknown whether exposure to multiple medications that are substrates ( not enzyme inhibitors ) for the same enzyme would further modify the pharmacokinetics of acheis . in our study ,
34% of participants were using a medication metabolized through the cyp2d6 pathway , and 59% used a medication metabolized through the cyp3a4/5 pathway .
future work should determine if the use of multiple substrates of cyp2d6 and cyp3a4/5 enzymes influences exposure to acheis .
our results indicate that both pharmacogenomic variants and concomitant medications may affect the pharmacokinetics and ultimately the efficacy and tolerability of ad medications . it will be important to determine the impact of these combined variables on clinical outcomes of tolerability and efficacy .
such findings should strengthen the rational approaches that can be used to personalize the pharmacologic management of older adults with ad .
cytochrome p450 - 2d6 genotype frequencies and hardy  weinberg ( hw ) test notes : 
 since the * 1 allele is a default allele based on the lack of other alleles , the hardy  weinberg test was not calculated , as the minor alleles are actually a variety of all other alleles tested .
medications with influence on hepatic enzymes used by study subjects notes : does not include study drug as enzyme substrate ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ) .","Background

"thrombospondin 1 ( tsp-1 ) was initially discovered in platelets as a thrombin - sensitive protein1 ) and is a matricellular protein that regulates cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions.2)3 ) functional studies in tsp-1 mice have shown that tsp-1 inhibits angiogenesis,4 ) promotes the healing of excision wounds,5 ) and limits inflammatory responses and fibrotic remodeling after myocardial infarction.6 ) tsp-1 also plays a role in platelet aggregation and thrombus adhesion to injured blood vessels and limits nitric oxide - mediated vasodilatation and tissue perfusion in experimental models of ischemic injury.7 ) thrombospondin-1 may represent a link between diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and vascular complications.8)9 ) high levels of glucose increase tsp-1 expression in renal mesangial cells.10 ) tsp-1 promotes the pathological events associated with diabetic nephropathy such as mesangial cell proliferation and increased extracellular matrix production by mesangial cells.10 - 13 ) a peptide blocking the activation of transforming growth factor- by tsp-1 prevents the progression of cardiac fibrosis and improves cardiac function in a rat model , suggesting that tsp-1 plays an important role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.14 ) however , the precise role of tsp-1 in human atherosclerosis remains unknown .
therefore , the present clinical study was conducted to examine the association between tsp-1 , coronary artery disease ( cad ) , and dm .
the study involved 374 consecutive subjects ( 206 men and 168 women ) with suspected cad from november 2008 to october 2009 .
the exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome , a serum creatinine level 2.0 mg / dl , and type 1 dm .
each participant provided written informed consent prior to procedures being performed , and potential risks were fully explained .
patients were considered to have dm if their fasting plasma glucose concentration was 126 mg / dl , or their two casual plasma glucose concentration was 200 mg / dl.15 ) systemic hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure 140 mm hg or a diastolic pressure 90 mm hg.16 ) smokers were defined as those who were currently smokers or who had a recent history of smoking ( i.e. , within the past 1 year ) .
a family history of premature cad was defined as cad in a male first - degree relative < 55 years old and a female first - degree relative < 65 years old .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated using weight ( kilograms ) divided by the square of the height ( meters ) .
significant coronary stenosis was defined as a stenosis > 50% in the left main trunk or > 70% in the other major epicardial coronary arteries .
the angiographic characteristics of the coronary atherosclerotic lesions were defined using gensini 's score.17 ) in this scoring system , a greater reduction in the luminal diameter receives a high score and a proximal lesion in the left anterior descending or the left circumflex artery is assigned a higher score than that of a distal lesion .
total cholesterol ( tc ) , triglyceride ( tg ) , high density lipoprotein - cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , low density lipoprotein - cholesterol , and high sensitive c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) concentrations were determined using standard biochemical procedures on a toshiba automated clinical chemistry analyzer ( toshiba , tokyo , japan ) . the glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) level indicates the mean blood glucose level during the previous 2 to 3 months .
hba1c concentrations were measured using a commercially available glycohemoglobin analyzer ( tosho , tokyo , japan ) .
after an overnight fast , blood samples for tsp-1 were drawn at the time of cag , before administration of contrast agent or medications .
samples were centrifuged to obtain plasma , and the plasma was immediately stored at -70 for subsequent analysis .
plasma tsp-1 concentration was assessed using a tsp-1 elisa kit ( r&d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) that had a minimum detection level of 0.355 ng / ml .
a one - way analysis of variance was used to compare the variables shown in table 1 and fig .

the four groups were not similar in terms of age , gender ratio , hypertension , family history of cad , bmi , serum creatinine , tg , hdl - c , hscrp , or tsp-1 levels . patients with cad were older and had higher serum creatinine levels compared to patients without cad , regardless of dm .
patients with dm and without cad { dm(+)cad ( - ) patients } had the highest bmi and tg levels .
patients without cad had higher hdl - c levels compared to those in patients with cad , regardless of dm .
hscrp was highest in patients with dm and cad { dm(+)cad(+ ) patients}. the incidences of male gender and a family history of cad were highest in patients without dm and with cad { dm(-)cad(+ ) } , and the incidence of hypertension was higher in patients with dm than that in patients without dm .
the four groups were similar in terms of smoking rate , tc , ldl - c , and uric acid .
no statistical difference was observed between hba1c level of dm(+)cad(+ ) patients and that of dm(+)cad(- ) patients . when we divided patients with cad based on dm , gensini 's score , and the number of involved vessels , no significant difference was observed between dm(+)cad(+ ) patients and dm(-)cad(+ ) patients .
we found that the plasma tsp-1 concentration was higher in dm(+)cad(+ ) patients compared to that in patients without dm and without cad { dm(-)cad(- ) patients } , dm(-)cad(+ ) patients , and dm(+)cad(- ) patients ( p<0.01 ) ( fig .
when patients were divided into two groups according to dm , plasma tsp-1 levels were higher in patients with dm than those in patients without dm ( 564.5113.5 ng / ml vs. 515.5127.4 ng / ml , p<0.001 ) ( fig .

metformin was more frequently prescribed in the cad group than that in the non - cad group , and an  glucosidase inhibitor was more frequently prescribed in the non - cad group than that in the cad group .
we examined whether tsp-1 levels correlated with any other various parameters or medications in all patients .
we found no parameter or medication that correlated with tsp-1 concentration in any patient ( table 3 ) .
gensini 's score was not correlated with plasma tsp-1 levels in cad(+ ) patients ( pearson 's coefficient=-0.047 , p=0.489 ) .
a simple logistic regression analysis showed that cad was significantly correlated with gender , bmi , hdl - c , and plasma tsp-1 levels in patients with dm ( table 4 ) .
simple logistic regression analysis variables with a p<0.20 were entered into a multivariate logistic model .

we found that plasma tsp-1 levels were higher in dm(+ ) cad(+ ) patients than those in other patients , but that plasma tsp-1 levels were not different between cad and non - cad patients in patients without dm .
a multivariate analysis showed that a high tsp-1 level was an independent predictor of cad in patients with dm .
vascular smooth muscle cell ( vsmc ) migration and proliferation are key events in the development of atherosclerotic lesions .
stimulating vsmcs through increased levels of tsp-1 in the diabetic vessel wall may explain the enhanced proliferation of vsmcs.18)19 ) two mechanisms have been suggested for the effect of higher plasma tsp-1 level on atherosclerosis in patients with dm.8 ) first , dysfunction of endothelial cells ( ecs ) in patients with dm is well known20 ) and tsp-1 certainly contributes to this dysfunction because of its antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on ecs.21)22 ) second , although tsp-1 in diabetic vessels may affect metabolism of the luminal ec monolayer and vsmcs , the large amounts of tsp-1 present in the adventitia ultimately results in compromised growth and remodeling of the vasa vasorum . indeed
, a previous study showed that the number of vasa vasorum cells decrease in the diabetic aorta and are inversely correlated with tsp-1 expression , a potent antiangiogenic agent.8 ) in blood vessels , this may lead to ischemic conditions in the inner layers of the vessel wall , and such oxygen stress could stimulate vsmc proliferation and initiate atherosclerotic lesions .
mcgillicuddy et al.23 ) showed that fluvastatin decreases tsp-1 expression and abolishes the ability of transforming growth factor-1 to induce tsp-1 expression in cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells .
recent studies have linked the tsp family , including tsp-1 , to the development of atherosclerosis at the genetic level.24 - 26 ) glucose regulates the expression of a number of vascular genes.27 ) activation of tsp-1 transcription is mediated by the glucose hexosamine pathway of catabolism , resulting in modulation of nuclear protein activity via glycosylation.9 ) in the present study , the tsp-1 level of dm(-)cad(+ ) patients was not higher than that of dm(- ) cad(- ) patients , suggesting that the release of tsp-1 is not related with cad in patients without dm .
we also found higher concentrations of human plasma tsp-1 in dm(+)cad(+ ) patients compared to those in the other groups ( fig .
gensini 's score was not positively correlated with plasma tsp-1 level in patients with cad , suggesting that a high tsp-1 level did not result in severe cad .
some differences in medication usage were observed , but table 3 shows no correlation between medication use and plasma tsp-1 levels , suggesting that the differences in tsp-1 levels do not originate from medication differences .
a multivariate regression analysis of patients with dm showed that male gender , a low level of hdl - c , a high level of hba1c , and a high level of plasma tsp-1 were independently and positively associated with cad .
male gender and a low level of hdl - c are well known risk factors for cardiovascular events . in prospective epidemiological studies , the incidence of cad is directly associated with the degree of hyperglycemia , as measured by hba1c . after adjusting for other risk factors , an increase of 1% in the hba1c level is associated with an 18% increased risk for cardiovascular events.28 ) we found that high hba1c level was a risk factor for cad , as previously reported .
our findings suggest that high tsp-1 plasma levels may be associated with cad in patients with dm .
although the physiological function of tsp-1 in humans is not fully understood , our cross - sectional data showed a positive correlation between plasma tsp-1 and the incidence of cad in patients with dm .
long - term clinical follow - up with a larger group of patients with dm is required to confirm these findings .
second , the study only included patients undergoing cag , which may have biased the findings .
third , the prevalence of diabetes may have been underestimated , because a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was not performed . plasma tsp-1 levels were higher in dm(+)cad(+ ) patients than those in other patients .
but , in the non - dm group , plasma tsp-1 levels showed no difference between patients with or without cad .
plasma tsp-1 level was an independent predictor for cad in patients with dm , indicating that increased plasma tsp-1 level might be associated with cad in patients with dm .

"normal pregnancy is associated with insulin resistance similar to that found in type 2 diabetes . this physiological resistance to insulin action during pregnancy
becomes more apparent in the second trimester , and insulin resistance increases progressively to term .
changes in insulin resistance occur to facilitate transport of glucose across the placenta to ensure normal fetal growth and development .
transfer of glucose across the placenta stimulates fetal pancreatic insulin secretion , and insulin acts as an essential growth hormone .
if resistance to maternal insulin action becomes too pronounced , maternal hyperglycemia occurs and gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) may be diagnosed .
gdm is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes , including large for gestational age ( lga ) , macrosomia ( usually defined as birthweight > 4 kg or > 4.5 kg ) , induction of labor , and cesarean section.1 there is also growing evidence that gdm is associated with an increased risk of long - term ill - health outcomes in the mother ( type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease)2,3 and offspring ( obesity and associated cardiometabolic risk).4,5
gdm is defined as carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycemia of variable severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy,6 gdm defined in this way includes women with undiagnosed preexisting diabetes , as well as women with first - onset hyperglycemia during pregnancy .
the confirmation of whether a woman has preexisting ( overt ) diabetes or gdm can only be reliably made following pregnancy ( as described in the  care following birth  section ) . in the past
, less severe gdm was referred to as impaired glucose tolerance and more severe as gdm ; now the whole higher end of the glucose spectrum is more simply referred to as gdm .
gdm is the most common metabolic disorder of pregnancy ; rates vary depending on population characteristics ( eg , maternal age , ethnicity , or body mass index [ bmi ] ) and screening and diagnostic strategies , including glucose thresholds used ( tables 1 and 2).79
screening is the process of identifying women who are at higher risk of gdm compared with the general population of pregnant women .
once identified , those women can consider further tests , and health care providers can offer interventions that may improve their health and/or that of their infant .
a screening program should offer more benefits than harm , at a reasonable cost to the health service .
a screening / diagnostic test is any approach used to gather clinical information for the purpose of making a clinical decision and is a process that helps determine the presence or absence of a condition . for gdm ,
the oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) is generally the diagnostic test of choice ; this test is usually administered between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation .
a plasma blood sample is obtained following an overnight fast and then a 75 g or 100 g glucose load is given and further plasma blood sample is obtained after 1 , 2 , or 3 hours .
gdm is diagnosed ( depending on the criteria used ) if one , two , or more glucose levels are equaled or exceeded . a recent systematic review identified only one trial ( with 248 women ) examining the effectiveness of the 75 g compared with the 100 g ogtt ; this trial reported that more women were diagnosed with gdm using the 75 g ogtt ; other important outcomes were not reported .
other methods to diagnose gdm have been evaluated , eg , using jelly beans , chocolate bars , and meals as the  challenge  in place of the more usual glucose load of the ogtt ; however , studies are few and include few women and consequently there is no clear evidence to suggest which test is superior.10 the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog)11 and uk national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) recommend that women who have had gdm in a previous pregnancy should be offered diagnostic testing ( acog also recommends early testing in obese women or women with impaired glucose metabolism ) as early as possible after pregnancy booking ( in either the first or second trimester ) to identify undiagnosed type 2 diabetes .
the australasian diabetes in pregnancy society ( adips ) recommends risk factor assessment in early pregnancy ; risk factors are ranked by severity and either one  high  risk factor or two  moderate 
risk factors are needed before an ogtt is offered ( table 2).12 for all women not tested in early pregnancy and those women with a negative early screen , the acog11 suggests that screening for gdm should take place at 2428 weeks by assessment of medical history , clinical risk factors , or a laboratory screening test ( table 2 ) .
the uk nice recommends that the risk of gdm be assessed in all women ( not previously identified as having type 2 diabetes ) using maternal characteristics or risk factors . if a woman has one or more of these risk factors ( family history of diabetes ; ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes ; south asian , black , or middle eastern ethnicity ;
previous history of having a macrosomic baby ; bmi ( kg / m ) 30 , or previous gdm ) , diagnostic testing should be offered at 2628 weeks of gestation.13 the adips recommends all women not identified in early pregnancy as having hyperglycemia should be offered a 75 g ogtt at 2428 weeks ( table 2).12 the performance of risk factors in identifying women who will develop gdm is poor ; however , when a risk factor identifies true positives well ( women with gdm ; has high sensitivity ) it poorly identifies true negatives ( women without gdm ; has low specificity ) and when a risk factor identifies true negatives well ( high specificity ) it poorly identifies true positives ( low sensitivity ) , consequently , to identify most women with gdm , most women may need to be tested.14 the 50 g oral glucose challenge test ( ogct ) , similarly to risk factors , can be used to identify women at high risk of gdm ; no overnight fast is required ( like the 75 g or 100 g ogtt ) , rather a 50 g glucose load is given and then an hour later a plasma blood sample is obtained ; if a glucose threshold is exceeded , an ogtt will be offered .
the american diabetes association ( ada ) recommends the glucose threshold of 7.8 mmol / l,15 though > 7.2 mmol / l and 7.5 mmol / l are also used .
the acog suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support one threshold over another ; for that reason , care providers should select one threshold and use it consistently in their population.11 the uk nice16 and the adips12 evaluated the evidence examining the performance of the 50 g ogct in identifying women who will develop gdm , reporting that the performance of the ogct is equivalent to that of risk factors , but it is more costly , and that the ogct lacks both sensitivity and specificity , respectively ; consequently , the 50 g ogct has not been recommended as a screening method in the uk or australasia.12,16 unlike the acog and the uk nice , the international association of diabetes in pregnancy study groups ( iadpsg ; indorsed recently by the world health organization [ who],17 adips,12 and the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics18 ) do not advocate screening women for  high - risk  status ( either by 50 g ogct or risk factors ) and recommend that all women not previously identified as having type 2 diabetes are offered a diagnostic test at 2428 weeks of gestation ( the 75 g ogtt).19 the approach of offering testing to only women with a risk factor or positive ogct ( nice / acog or  two - step  approach / selective testing ) may miss some women with hyperglycemia who may benefit from treatment ; the latter approach ( the iadpsg or 
approach / universal testing ) may result in unnecessary testing of women at low risk , but more women will be identified and therefore more may benefit from treatment , though it is unclear which screening and testing approach is most clinically helpful or cost - effective.10,14,20 in response to the lack of evidence supporting one approach over another , the ada recommends using either the one- or two - step approach ( two step using the 50 g ogct ) but suggests that a consistent approach to testing would be beneficial.15 recent studies7,21 show a graded positive linear association between maternal glucose and risk of important perinatal adverse outcomes , including cesarean section , lga , and infant adiposity .
this means that for each increase in glucose ( at ogtt ) , there is an increase in risk of adverse outcomes ; consequently , there is no clear clinical threshold at which risk increases significantly , which would indicate a threshold to diagnose gdm and offer treatment .
first , a decision on what the aim of gdm diagnosis is needs to be made .
previously , the aim was to identify women at risk of future type 2 diabetes;22 more recently , the need to reduce the risk of associated perinatal adverse outcomes was recognized and it is known from treatment trials that controlling and reducing hyperglycemia reduce the risk of some of these perinatal outcomes23,24 and this is important to both women and clinicians.25 importantly , there is now evidence that the offspring of women who have had gdm are at increased risk of future obesity and cardiometabolic ill - health .
reducing long - term obesity risk is key for the future health of the population and one way to potentially achieve this is by treating women with hyperglycemia during pregnancy .
the iadpsg , therefore , devised criteria aimed at identifying infants of women with gdm at increased risk of long - term future obesity and cardiometabolic ill - health through their association with the perinatal outcomes such as high cord c - peptide ( surrogate for insulin ) , lga , and high infant adiposity . by treating these women and reducing hyperglycemia ,
the risk of these adverse perinatal outcomes may be reduced along with subsequent long - term risks.19 the iadpsg derived their new threshold criteria using data from the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes study.21 hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes is an observational study showing graded linear associations between maternal glucose and adverse outcomes ( described earlier).21 because no clear clinical thresholds were identified , the iadpsg derived thresholds based on the glucose values at which the odds ratios reached 1.75 above mean glucose values , for birthweight greater than the 90th percentile , percent infant body fat ( based on skinfolds ) greater than the 90th percentile , and concentration of cord c - peptide greater than the 90th percentile .
the iadpsg - recommended thresholds are as follows : plasma glucose levels of 5.1 mmol / l , 10 mmol / l , and 8.5 mmol / l for fasting , 1 hour , and 2 hour postload ( 75 g ogtt ) , respectively .
although somewhat arbitrary and derived from just one study , these thresholds have been recently endorsed by the who17 and others.12 the uk nice , however , recommends different thresholds ( fasting : 5.6 mmol / l and 2 hours postload : 7.8 mmol / l [ 75 g ogtt ] ) but does not make clear how they were derived.13,16 the acog conversely recommends using either the carpenter and coustan or the national diabetes data group criteria thresholds.11 given the linear association between glucose and risk of adverse outcomes , it is possible that identifying and treating women at lower glucose levels than were previously recommended will result in a reduction in risk of these outcomes because more women will be identified and treated .
the clinical effectiveness of the iadpsg - recommended criteria , however , is inferred from treatment trials that show a reduction in risk of lga and macrosomia in women identified using higher glucose level thresholds , whether treating these women influences long - term health is unknown and that is a possible reason for the lack of uniformity in recommendations from international institutions such as the who , uk nice , ada , adips , and acog .
this absence of evidence and variation in recommended identification approaches has led to calls for trials investigating the application of different glucose thresholds for gdm diagnosis on maternal and offspring short- and long - term health outcomes .
whether all , or only high - risk women , are tested , what glucose load ( 75 g/100 g ) is administered as part of the ogtt , what proportion of women have risk factors that predispose to gdm , and what glucose threshold criteria are used to diagnose gdm will all influence the prevalence of gdm . as an example of these influences , table 3 shows the prevalence of gdm reported in different locations in the uk and the republic of ireland .
prevalence varies from 1.1% in 1980 in leicester using the who 1980 criteria ( selective testing of only high - risk women , using higher glucose thresholds than iadpsg ) to 24.3% in 2012 in manchester using the iadpsg criteria ( universal offer of testing within an observational study ) .
a recent study estimated that globally in 2013 , 21.4 million out of an estimated 127.1 million live births to women aged 2049 years ( crude prevalence , 16.9% ; age - standardized prevalence , 14.8% ) were affected by gdm.26 prevalence increases markedly in women over the age of 40 years and differs by region , with the majority of women with hyperglycemia residing in low- to middle - income countries , eg , southeast asia ( bangladesh , india , and sri lanka ) has the highest crude prevalence ( 23.1% ) and western pacific ( australia , the people s republic of china , hong kong , japan , malaysia , singapore , thailand , and vietnam ) has the lowest ( 11.8% ) ; there is , however , also wide variation in reported prevalences for countries within these regions.26 identifying greater numbers of women with gdm clearly has resource implications for care providers ( but identifying more women could reduce the risk of adverse outcomes ) and this is likely to influence whether a particular approach to the identification of women with gdm is followed .
the large numbers of women with hyperglycemia in low- to middle - income countries are concerning as these countries may be the least well equipped to provide interventions to reduce associated risks , and socioeconomic influences may further disadvantage affected women and infants .
similarly , subgroups of socially deprived women in higher income countries may respond less well to intervention from health care providers compared with their socially advantaged counterparts ; consequently , educational and support services should be tailored to the differing needs of these groups of women.26,27
as discussed earlier , the treatment of gdm aims to reduce hyperglycemia and in turn reduces the risk of adverse outcomes .
diet and lifestyle modification / information is usually provided as first - line treatment and may in the future be more commonly the only treatment needed , if the widespread acceptance of lower gdm glucose threshold criteria occurs .
self - monitoring of glucose levels is recommended , particularly when oral hypoglycemics or insulin is required and levels are reviewed at each clinical visit .
oral hypoglycemic agents ( metformin and glyburide ) present a possible alternative to injected insulin and seem effective as a first - line pharmacological intervention28 with the added benefit of perhaps being more acceptable to women , because metformin is taken orally as opposed to insulin that is injected .
however , when packages of care compared with routine care were evaluated , up to half of women initially prescribed metformin require supplemental insulin.2833 metformin is also easier to store and can be kept at room temperature , whereas insulin requires refrigeration .
however , metformin may cause gastrointestinal upset,34 and this may reduce compliance , prompting the need for supplemental insulin .
treatments may also increase the risk of some adverse perinatal outcomes and concerns have been expressed about the potential for harm associated with the medicalization of pregnancy which predisposes caregivers toward an expectation of adverse outcomes and may increase morbidity due to increased interventions , including induction of labor .
metformin use has caused concern because it crosses the placenta and may therefore affect fetal development , though trials do not suggest that harms are increased when metformin is provided as first - line pharmacological treatment compared with insulin.28 insulin and glyburide may cause maternal hypoglycemia , however , which may influence fetal well - being and could be harmful to women , though this risk must be balanced against the development of hyperglycemia and the increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes .
care is best provided by a team of clinicians , including nurse / midwife , obstetrician , diabetologist , dietician , and diabetic nurse specialist .
care should be individualized and dependent on the woman s views and needs and the degree of hyperglycemia , glucose control and presence / absence of other abnormalities ( eg , lga ) and medical conditions ( eg , hypertension ) .
this individualized approach allows variation in the intensity of treatment ( the step - up approach described earlier ) , eg , women with less severe hyperglycemia may require only diet and lifestyle modification and may require less intensive monitoring and antenatal visits than women with more severe hyperglycemia needing an additional pharmacological intervention to control hyperglycemia.14,35 using the  step - up 
approach ensures that interventions are only offered if required , resulting in less burden for the woman and care providers , which is particularly important given the increasing prevalence of gdm .
the uk nice now recommends women with gdm to be advised to eat a  healthy diet  during pregnancy and emphasize that foods with a low glycemic index should replace those with a high glycemic index and that women should walk 30 minutes a day to improve glucose control , though there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of this advice in improving outcomes . as with care during pregnancy , care during labor should be individually tailored ; women with less severe and well - controlled hyperglycemia and with a normally grown fetus may need less intensive monitoring or interventions such as induction , compared with women with severe less well - controlled hyperglycemia with an lga fetus .
for most women , insulin resistance rapidly returns to normal following birth and therefore glucose - lowering treatments should be stopped if blood glucose levels decline and stay within normal parameters .
care of women following normalization of glucose levels is therefore the same as for any woman , though as with all women , care should be individualized .
the care of infants of women who have had gdm depends on the infant s health and adaptation at birth .
these infants are , however , at increased risk of hypoglycemia and as such , early , sustained , and adequate feeding is essential .
all infants should be monitored ( for signs of hypoglycemia and well - being ) , particularly in the first 24 hours following birth . any infant asymptomatic of hypoglycemia should be allowed to demand feed and should not be subjected to invasive glucose level monitoring .
infants showing poor adaptation following birth or who show signs of hypoglycemia may need supplemental feeds and closer monitoring , including glucose estimation .
a proportion of women diagnosed with gdm will subsequently at postnatal testing be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and a proportion of these women will have had diabetes preceding their pregnancy .
approximately 50% of women who have had gdm will develop type 2 diabetes within 510 years ; this corresponds to a 7.5-fold increased risk over women who have not had gdm.2,36 women with gdm may not , however , attribute this risk to themselves , eg , in one study of women with gdm , 90% were aware of a link ( between gdm and type 2 diabetes ) , but only 16% believed they themselves were at risk , this increased to 39% if they were told to assume they continued to live their current lifestyle.37 therefore , women may plan to modify their lifestyle in an attempt to prevent future development of type 2 diabetes , whether this plan is realized , however , is unclear .
irrespective of women s intentions , health professionals have a responsibility to ensure women fully appreciate the risks and signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia .
the acog recommends postnatal screening at 612 weeks following birth , to identify continuing insulin resistance and hyperglycemia , and suggests that either a fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) or the 75 g , 2-hour ogtt is an appropriate test.11 the ada recommends testing to be continued at three yearly intervals , whereas the adips suggests that testing every 12 years is sufficient and the uk nice recommends yearly testing .
the ada does not recommend the hba1c at early postnatal testing ( which provides an estimate of average plasma glucose concentration over a period of weeks ) because of the antenatal treatment to reduce hyperglycemia .
this test could , however , be used at later follow - up and a result of 6.5% would indicate type 2 diabetes.15 compared with the 75 g ogtt , the fpg is easier to perform , as no glucose load is given and no postload estimation is obtained ( an fpg of > 7 mmol / l would indicate type 2 diabetes ) .
the adips recommends the 75 g ogtt at 612 weeks postnatal period,12 and the uk nice recommends a fasting plasma assessment;13 however , the ogtt will also identify impaired glucose tolerance ( 2-hour postload sample 11.1
mmol / l ) as well as impaired fasting glucose so may be preferred and the test that adequately identifies abnormal postnatal glucose metabolism and insulin resistance may depend on population characteristics.38,39 however , rates of attendance at this postnatal assessment are low 40,41 and may reflect women s perception of personal low risk as described earlier and also a lack of perceived importance placed on this condition by clinicians .
because of the increasing prevalence of gdm and its adverse influence on perinatal outcomes and associated long - term health outcomes , efforts have been made to evaluate interventions aimed at reducing the risk of gdm , particularly in high - risk obese women .
one recent trial evaluated the provision of dietary and physical activity advice in addition to routine care during pregnancy .
gdm rate did not differ between the two groups and although women assigned to the intervention compared with the control group gained less weight and were less adipose ( sum of skinfolds ) ; these differences were marginal ( 0.5 kg and 3 mm , respectively ) and arguably not clinically relevant.42 a further trial has evaluated metformin use in obese pregnant women ( without diabetes ) and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes . although metformin is an effective treatment for gdm because it improves sensitivity to insulin , this trial failed to demonstrate any substantial effect on any outcome including the risk of gdm and high birthweight.43 the health of childbearing - age women is not just an issue confined to pregnancy .
the lack of an effect of interventions in pregnancy designed to prevent gdm ( described earlier ) suggests that interventions to prevent gdm may be more successful if delivered outside of pregnancy when a more sustained approach to healthy living can take place .
there is evidence that lifestyle interventions and metformin use in overweight people ( outside of pregnancy ) are effective interventions for reducing the risk of development of diabetes , with lifestyle interventions being more effective than metformin.44 therefore , it may be that these interventions should be evaluated in young women prior to pregnancy .
the uk nice now recommends that women who have had gdm are offered lifestyle advice ( including weight control , diet , and exercise)13 to reduce the risk of future type 2 diabetes,45 but this approach will not prevent initial gdm in a large and growing group of women .
understanding that the risk of adverse outcomes increases with increasing glucose level ( measured by the ogtt in pregnancy ) , across the whole glucose spectrum , is important for both women and those caring for them . to be able to target treatments at women most likely to benefit , however ,
the lack of clear clinical glucose thresholds has led to a variety of recommended criteria leading to global variation in practice , which is harmful to women and their infants .
there is limited evidence to support one approach for the identification of women with hyperglycemia / gdm over another .
gdm treatment trials using older higher glucose thresholds ( than the newer iadpsg - recommended criteria ) show a reduction in risk of some perinatal outcomes ; however , there are no trials that have used the iadpsg criteria , so the effect of using these criteria and short- or long - term outcomes is unknown and this has led to calls for trials evaluating different threshold criteria for gdm . the increasing prevalence of obesity and obesity - related conditions including gdm is a public health concern . a sustained approach to supporting women to live healthily , including the achievement of a normal bmi before and after pregnancy is urgently needed . large well - designed trials to evaluate lifestyle interventions to reduce bmi and risk of gdm for women of childbearing age are urgently required . if we can find ways to hold back and even reduce the rising obesity epidemic in the general population and help women already overweight / obese achieve a normal weight , health improvements for the pregnant population will follow and these improvements may impact the future health of the whole population .
health professionals should provide women and their families with information and ensure that they understand what foods are beneficial and what foods to avoid and also what constitutes a  good  level of physical activity as well as provide signposting to other support services .","Introduction

"dolichoectatic and fusiform aneurysms represent a small subset of cerebral aneurysms and are among the most difficult to treat .
the pathophysiology of fusiform cerebral aneurysms includes a disrupted internal elastic lamina and muscle layer that might be susceptible to mechanical injury by hemodynamic strain , causing progressive attenuation of the arterial wall .
the treatment of fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery is challenging for several reasons , including the presence of perforating vessels , the proximity to the brain stem and the exiting cranial nerves , and the surgical approaches necessary to access the basilar artery .
we present the case of a patient with acute brain stem ischemic stroke who had a fusiform basilar artery aneurysm complicated by a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage .
our objective is to discuss the difficulties in the acute management of this disease , its potential treatments and complications .
a 53-year - old man with a previous history of hypertension and obesity was admitted to our emergency department with sudden right hemiplegia , hemianopsia , and dysarthria within 2 h from symptom onset .
his national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) score at admission was 19 , and he had no previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks .
the patient 's neurological symptoms progressively improved during the first hour after admission , with only a right facial palsy ( nihss 2 ) remaining .
a head ct at admission showed a hyperdense basilar artery , and a ct angiography ( cta ) confirmed a basilar fusiform aneurysm with a thrombus within the vessel and no signs of acute dissection ( fig .
he was treated with antiplatelets and transferred to our intensive care unit . due to his clinical improvement
a head ct revealed an extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and posterior fossa ( fisher grade 3 ; fig .
basilar artery fusiform aneurysms pose difficulties to treatment because , during the course of the disease , both bleeding and thrombosis can occur . in addition , bleeding may be a complication of a basilar artery fusiform aneurysm in patients initially presenting with brain ischemia , even when anticoagulation and thrombolytic treatments are not used , as happened in our patient .
fusiform cerebral aneurysms can be divided into acute dissecting aneurysms , which usually cause subarachnoid hemorrhage or cerebral ischemia , and chronic fusiform or dolichoectatic aneurysms , which slowly enlarge with time and can be asymptomatic or associated with cranial nerve dysfunction , ischemic stroke , subarachnoid hemorrhage , pseudotumor , or hydrocephalus .
although important for the treatment decision - making , the differentiation between a dissecting and a chronic fusiform aneurysm is often difficult , even with advanced neuroimaging techniques [ 1 , 4 , 6 ] . in our patient , regardless of the acute presentation of an ischemic event and posterior bleeding , no signs of dissection were seen on the cta or the mri / mra of the brain .
more than half of large cerebral aneurysms with a diameter of 20 mm or more are known to have thrombi like the one seen in our patient .
the mortality rate of patients with fusiform basilar aneurysms is approximately 70% if the basilar artery has become occluded [ 8 , 9 ] .
conversely , the occurrence of hemorrhagic events is associated with the degree of ectasia of the basilar artery .
anticoagulation therapy at conventional doses seems to increase the risk of intracranial bleeding [ 11 , 12 ] .
the role of antiplatelet agents in promoting hemorrhagic strokes in such patients is less clear .
the treatment of such lesions can be a dilemma , as in the case described . in patients with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia
considering that the current treatment risks can exceed the natural risk of basilar rupture or occlusion , a better understanding of the pathophysiology is required to help select patients at higher risk of hemorrhagic or ischemic events for invasive treatments [ 4 , 5 ] .","Introduction

"many severe diseases resulting from infections , such as meningitis , dengue , or leprosy , are relatively rare within the human population when compared with the often ubiquitous nature of the causative infectious agent in specific world regions .
while antibody responses to these organisms can be measured in large percentages of these populations , disease leading to hospitalization affects a small minority .
this has led to the realization that the type of host response made to an infectious encounter may play a large role in determining the outcome .
understanding how most people successfully contain these infectious challenges may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for those individuals at risk of severe disease .
this application of human genetics has proven insightful in those rare humans who are broadly susceptible to infections , where mendelian genetic linkage approaches have revealed highly penetrant mutations that cause disease . with the advent of genome - wide association study ( gwas ) technology
, the field has been looking to see if the lessons learnt can be carried over to more common infectious diseases .
the first studies of immune response defects and infectious disease outcomes strongly suggested that infectious diseases would have shared pathways to disease .
severe combined immune deficiency ( scid ) - a genetic disorder that affects the adaptive immune system - demonstrates the importance of the immune system in protection against infection , as patients with scid quickly succumb to life - threatening sepsis from a very wide range of infectious agents . the gene responsible for the majority of scid cases , cd132 ( the common -chain ) , was identified using the traditional linkage approach [ 1 - 3 ] . because the common -chain is shared by many cytokine receptors ( receptors for il-2 , il-4 , il-7 , il-9 , il-15 , and il-21 ) , mutations that result in a non - functional common -chain cause widespread defects in il signaling and failure of b and t cells to develop and mature .
this is a rather profound example , and knowledge of the responsible gene has opened avenues for therapeutic intervention in cases of x - linked scid , where gene transfer of the normal cd132 appears to be a promising , even curative , treatment modality .
similar observations and clinical conclusions have been made with another form of scid caused by defects in the variable , diversity , joining recombination process .
partial immune deficiency , referring to the inactivation of a single immune pathway due to genetic mutations in one or more members of the network , was initially suspected to act in a similar way to the scid mutations , with patients having a predisposition to a wide variety of infections .
as these mutations are highly penetrant , traditional genetic linkage studies have been able to isolate the responsible genes and pathways for some of these conditions , many of which have severe or even fatal clinical presentations .
notable examples include the ifn- receptor ( ifngr1 ) in cases of severe mycobacterial infections , the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( lyst ) for chediak - higashi syndrome , and bruton 's tyrosine kinase for x - linked agammaglobulinemia .
while the immune system has multiple pathways , each is thought to be active against a wide range of microorganisms .
thus , it is perhaps surprising that the spectrum of infection susceptibility for these three genes appears to be fairly constrained .
for example , ifngr1 mutations mainly predispose to mycobacterial infections , and lyst and bruton 's tyrosine kinase mutations mainly predispose to predominantly pyogenic bacterial infections ( for example , streptococcus pyogenes , pneumococcus , and haemophilus influenzae ) .
this surprising finding echoes another example : that of complement deficiency and its observed confinement to increased susceptibility towards encapsulated bacteria , particularly neisseria spp .
, despite consistent documentation on the importance of the complement pathway in common blood pathogen clearance .
in the last 5 years , advances in genomic research have enabled the use of the gwas design , permitting the robust identification of host susceptibility genes for infectious pathogens in increased detail . although the advent of gwas in infectious diseases has been slow compared with gwas in many other complex disease phenotypes ,
this approach has nonetheless allowed unprecedented identification ( or confirmation ) of genes associated with susceptibility to the infectious diseases studied so far [ 15 - 18 ] .
infectious disease genes identified via the gwas approach have thus far been relatively ' pathogen specific ' , with cross - pathogen sharing being the exception rather than the rule .
the greatest surprise has related to observations within the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) locus , where broad - based sharing between pathogen groups could be expected , given the central role played by hla in immune recognition of pathogens and the initiation of immune responses .
however , recent gwas have found that while different hla alleles appear to be shared between various auto - immune phenotypes ( such as psoriasis , vitiligo , or systemic lupus erythematosus ) , there appears to be little evidence of substantial susceptibility sharing for hla between different infectious diseases .
this disparity is striking even among supposedly ' similar ' pathogen groups : a very strong contribution of the hla locus has been observed for leprosy ( mycobacterium leprae ) , but not for tuberculosis ( mycobacterium tuberculosis ) susceptibility , highlighting the vast complexity of the immune response to diverse pathogens .
this complexity is further shown in two genetic studies of vaccine response : while the hla is crucial for success ( or otherwise ) for hepatitis b virus vaccination , it is not the case for h. influenzae type b vaccination .
although findings thus far have suggested that the main pathways underlying susceptibility to pathogenic infection are pathogen specific , it is nonetheless relevant to understand similarities in the infection and invasion process for the very diverse pathogens that the human body encounters daily .
for example , knowledge gleaned from the rare primary immune deficiencies has shown that defects in extremely central components of the immune system result in broad , general susceptibility to multiple infectious diseases .
elucidation of the responsible genes and pathways often yields considerable insight into disease mechanisms and pathogenesis , and can inform medical treatment ( a good example being the case of x - linked agammaglobulinemia where common antibiotic treatments do not suffice , and immunoglobulin replacement is necessary ) . if some of these therapeutic findings could be extended to the commoner forms of infection that clinicians encounter on a daily basis , this could have an immediate public health impact .
one of the virulent capabilities of neisseria meningitidis is its ability to recruit human factor h ( encoded by cfh ) via molecular mimicry , thus avoiding complement - mediated killing of the bacterium .
a recently completed gwas on host susceptibility to meningococcal disease has shown that genetic polymorphisms within cfh as well as cfh - related genes are very strongly associated with susceptibility to meningococcal disease .
as the bacterial factor h - binding protein is now a strong meningococcal vaccine candidate , it is clear that genomic approaches can be used independently to discover or to confirm therapeutic targets identified by functional approaches .
leprosy , tuberculosis , crohn 's disease , and ulcerative colitis have also been the subjects of recent investigations . indeed
, genomic approaches have underlined the importance of the nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain containing ( nod)2 signaling cascade in inflammatory and infectious diseases .
different members of the pathway ( nod2 , tnfsf15 , and ripk2 ) have been strongly implicated ( p < 10 ) in susceptibility to leprosy , as well as crohn 's disease , which is an inflammatory bowel disease with substantial links to infectious agents .
however , observations by us and others   do not implicate nod2 pathway members as strongly in tuberculosis susceptibility .
the same has been observed for card9 ( a member of the extended nod family of genes ) , which has been strongly associated with ulcerative colitis susceptibility   and functionally implicated in tuberculosis , but not with leprosy .
another gene observed to be a strong ( p < 10 ) susceptibility factor for leprosy is tnfsf15 .
the exact same snp ( rs6478108 ) has also been found to be strongly associated ( p < 10 ) with crohn 's disease .
however , the minor allele has been found to be associated with increased risk of leprosy , but with decreased risk of crohn 's disease .
this suggests that differential regulation of the immune response appears to be critical to reach a balance between protection from invading pathogens and susceptibility to inflammatory disorders , thus highlighting tnfsf15 as a potential therapeutic target in manipulation of the strength of the immune response .
indeed , the disparity in susceptibility genes for crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis ( different members of the pathogen - sensing card family are involved : nod2 for crohn 's , and card9 for ulcerative colitis ) is likely to reflect different sites of pathology , different bacterial spectra , and therefore different mechanisms for microbial recognition .
strikingly , there is evidence suggesting that the downstream , cytokine - mediated pathogenesis pathways ( for example , those involving il-23 ) could be common across both diseases .
the majority of evidence collected so far from genomic approaches appears to suggest that , barring specific exceptions , common host susceptibility to different invading pathogens appears to be controlled by discrete genes and pathways .
as genomic approaches are still limited in resolution , there is a possibility that truly shared mechanisms governing susceptibility across multiple pathogen groups have yet to be found .
this seems to be likely in view of the finite number of pathogen - recognizing receptors available at the first lines of defence , coupled with their convergent , downstream signaling pathways .
an example for ' shared susceptibility ' would be tirap , which encodes a common adaptor for two major pathogen - sensing receptors ( tlr2 and tlr4 ) ; an inactivating mutation ( s180l ) within tirap appears to associate with susceptibility to invasive pneumococcus and h. influenzae , as well as trypanosoma cruzi infections , with a yet unconfirmed association with tuberculosis .
considering the evidence now available , there is reason to believe that host susceptibility to infection could be specific and ' mechanism dependent ' in terms of pathogen recognition and the site of infection , with shared common signaling pathways playing an important role downstream of pathogen contact points .
a further benefit in the large - scale deployment of hypothesis - free genomic approaches is that they could help in establishing the etiology of certain autoimmune diseases where infectious diseases have long been suspected - but not confirmed - to be a predisposing factor .
for example , in the case of type 1 diabetes , gwas have implicated an extraordinary number of immune - related genes , some of which overlap with infection pathways , thus lending credence to the above hypothesis .
genomic approaches have resulted in improved treatment strategies for patients with severe and partial immune deficiencies by identifying the deficient protein component(s ) , but for many of the common infections , due to their complex nature , genomic approaches have not yet been as fruitful in informing medical treatment .
emerging antibiotic resistance is putting additional pressure on research efforts in host and pathogen genomics for further improvement of therapeutic strategy beyond antimicrobial treatment , but there is hope that this research will lead to novel human protein - based therapies .
gwas : genome - wide association studies ; hla : human leukocyte antigen ; il : interleukin ; nod2 : nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain containing ; scid : severe combined immune deficiency ; snp : single nucleotide polymorphism .

"the stm 
 experiments have been carried out in a low - temperature ( 5 k ) stm system 
 ( createc germany ) , operated for the measurements 
 presented here with liquid n2 in the cryostat stage , yielding 
 a sample temperature of 85 k. sample cleaning and preparation and in situ stm tip treatments were 
 performed in the preparation chamber .
electrochemically etched w tips 
 have been treated in situ by electron bombardment heating and by field 
 emission via voltage pulses .
the stm images have been recorded in 
 constant current mode , with the bias applied to the sample .
differential 
 conductance ( di / dv versus v ) sts spectra have been recorded with a lock - in technique 
 with a 1.175 khz modulation frequency and 100 mv modulation amplitude . 
 the photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were carried out in a 
 custom - designed system for x - ray ( xps ) and uv photoelectron spectroscopy 
 ( ups ) ( specs germany ) ; mg k radiation was used for core level 
 xps and he i radiation for valence band ups .
the sample work function 
 was measured from the low - energy electron cutoff in ups spectra .
both 
 experimental systems are equipped with leed , which was used to cross - check 
 the identity and quality of the respective ceria surfaces .
the 
 cu(110 ) surface has been cleaned by ar bombardment , 
 700 ev , followed by annealing at 850 k. cerium metal was evaporated 
 from a ta crucible in an electron beam evaporator , and the evaporating 
 flux was measured with a quartz microbalance .
various oxide thin film 
 preparation procedures have been tested , such as reactive evaporation 
 of ce in oxygen atmosphere or postoxidation of ce metal deposited 
 at the clean and oxygen precovered cu surface ; all procedures resulted 
 in the epitaxial growth of 2-d cerium oxide films .
however , the layers 
 with the best structural order have been obtained by the postoxidation 
 method : ce metal was evaporated onto the clean cu(110 ) surface at 
 300350 k and postoxidized in ( 15 )  10 mbar o2 at 750800 k , followed by a few min annealing 
 in o2 at 800850 k. under these preparation conditions , 
 the ceria stoichiometry is close to ceo2 , but slightly 
 understoichiometric ( ceo1.921.96 ) as evidenced 
 by xps ( see figure s3 , si ) . for submonolayer 

oxide coverages , the coexisting cu(110 ) surface patches are oxidized 
 to the ( 2  1)-o reconstruction , if the o2 pressure 
 during postoxidation is kept below 1  10 mbar . for higher oxygen pressures , po2  10 mbar ,
the cu(110 ) surface is oxidized to the c(6 
  2)-o reconstruction , and the ceria overlayer becomes stoichiometric 
 ceo2 . using the postoxidation procedure ,
no influence of 
 the o2 pressure on the 2-d morphology of the ceria overlayer 
 has been observed within the employed pressure range ( 1  10 mbar -5  10 mbar ) , in agreement 
 with reports in the literature .
the ceria 
 surface coverage has been estimated from the inspection of large scale 
 stm images ( 1 monolayer ( ml ) of ( 111)-type ceria corresponds to 7.9 
  10 ce atoms / cm ) . theory .
dft calculations were performed using 
 the quantumespresso code , employing a 
 basis set of plane waves , ultrasoft pseudopotentials , and the perdew  burke 
ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation 
 ( xc- ) functional , complemented by the 
 introduction of a hubbard u term on the 
 ce atoms with a value of u = 4.5 ev . in a first scan , the ( 3  11 ) unit cell was approximated 
 with a ( 3  2 ) cell , measuring 7.65  6.88  ( see figure 
 s5 , si ) , where the oxide was elongated 
 by about 3.8% along the y direction ( from 6.62 to 
 6.88  ) . selected simulations were also performed with the much 
 bigger and computationally demanding ( 3  11 ) unit cell .
values 
 of 20 and 200 ry were chosen as the energy cutoff for the selection 
 of the plane waves for the description of the wave function and the 
 electronic density , respectively .
the brillouin zone was sampled at 
 the gamma point only , which is accurate for such big unit cells .
the 
 electronic levels were broadened with a gaussian smearing of about 
 0.002 ry ( 1 ry = 13.606 ev ) and all the calculations were performed 
 spin - polarized .
stm images were simulated applying the tersoff - hamann 
 approach at a constant height of about 
 2  above the oxide surface . along the z axis
, 
 a minimum empty space of 15  was chosen to avoid interactions 
 between replicated cells .
our dft approach predicts an equilibrium value of the cu metal 
 lattice constant of about 2.58  , in good agreement with the 
 experimental value of 2.55  . in the calculations here presented , 

the experimental value of the cu lattice constant was used , and the 
 cu surface was modeled as a slab with six layers frozen in their crystal 
 positions , while the positions of the atoms in the ceox / cuox systems 
 were optimized until the forces where smaller than 10 ev  .
our dft approach accurately predicts 
 the bulk lattice constant of ceo2 fluorite - like crystal 
 structure ( where each ce atom is coordinated by eight o atoms at the 
 vertices of a cube , whereas each o atom is coordinated by four ce 
 atoms at the vertices of a tetrahedron ) : 3.89  , to be compared 
 to an experimental value of 3.91  . as a further validation
, 
 we also calculated the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy at a 
 ( 111 ) ceo2 surface obtaining a value of 4.83 ev , in very 
 good agreement with the literature value of 4.95 ev obtained by fabris .
we also verified that the electronic distribution 
 around the vacancy is correctly described , with two electrons left 
 by the missing oxygen localized on the 4f states of two cerium atoms 
 next to the vacancy , hence shifting their oxidation state from + 4 
 to + 3 .",Methods,a5578733-00c1-40d5-b918-34970c1da264,1040,"[1820, 56358, 720, 21896, 617, 1027, 11953, 704, 304, 264, 3428, 482, 9499, 320, 220, 20, 597, 883, 56358, 1887, 720, 320, 1893, 66,

"septic shock is a persistent and non - resolved issue in intensive care units , with an increasing incidence rate of 15% .
the mortality rate from it , after having decreased thanks to the implementation of specific guidelines , is still 40% and thus of consequence .
all recent clinical trials have returned negative results such that we now might not expect new efficient therapies to improve septic shock management .
etiological treatment ( anti - infectious therapy , surgery ) , the excessive inflammation state , and multiple organ failure , including septic cardiomyopathy and vascular hyporeactivity , are the main aspects that remain to be improved .
vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors is a significant and independent prognostic factor of mortality involving several mechanisms and numerous cellular pathways and for which there is no new efficient and safe targeted therapy .
the renin - angiotensin system plays a major role in vascular reactivity regulation in healthy patients .
constriction of vascular smooth muscle for vessel contractions involves synergistic processes leading to an increase in intracellular calcium .
this increase is the result of neural or hormonal activation by ligands such as norepinephrine and angiotensin ii .
although widely suspected , specific angiotensin ii receptor involvement during septic shock has never been clearly assessed before the recent study by mederle and colleagues . in their present work ,
mederle and colleagues aim to demonstrate that experimental sepsis induces down regulation of angiotensin 1 receptor - associated protein 1 ( arap1 ) expression , which contributes to hypotension through vascular hyporesponsiveness to angiotensin ii . in a previous study ,
widely distributed in the vascular system , arap1 is a relevant choice to explore renin - angiotensin system involvement in septic shock . in the new study ,
the authors show a drop in mean arterial pressure in arap1/ deficient mice compared to wild - type mice after lipopolysaccharide injection . a subsequently observed transient recovery of mean arterial pressure appears to be linked to the activation of the renin - angiotensin system .
addition of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme was found to suppress this short recovery , hence supporting this hypothesis . moreover ,
both in vivo and in vitro arap1 expression was significantly and deeply downregulated after lipopolysaccharide injection . in isolated perfused kidney , renal vascular resistance
was reduced in response to incremental doses of angiotensin ii in kidneys from arap1/ compared to wild - type mice .
surprisingly , renin secretion was enhanced in vivo in arap1/ mice , which is probably explained by systemic rather than direct effects of angiotensin ii on renin - producing cells .
finally , this work yields important key messages regarding angiotensin ii pathophysiology during septic shock . during endotoxemia
importantly , the impact of arap1 deficiency on survival of arap1/ compared to wild - type mice during endotoxemia is unknown .
this information could clarify the importance of arap1 deficiency in sepsis compared to other mechanisms ( atp - sensitive k  +  channel activation , nitric oxide , peroxynitrite , and so on ) .
moreover , the downregulation of arap1 gene expression ( protein expression was not confirmed in this study ) may be an adaptive mechanism during endotoxemia .
hagiwara and colleagues   previously demonstrated for other specific angiotensin ii receptors that a type 1 angiotensin ii receptor antagonist reduces lung damage in an experimental septic shock model . the pro - inflammatory effect of angiotensin ii may be counteracted by inhibition of arap1 .
further studies are needed to determine the impact on survival and the importance of arap1 deficiency compared to other mechanisms involved in vascular hyporesponsiveness .
this new pathophysiological means of vascular hyporeactivity could represent a future area of research , with many therapeutic implications for the management of refractory septic shock .
on the other hand , numerous pathways and molecules have been implicated in vascular hyporesponsiveness induced by sepsis .
despite very convincing pre - clinical data , none of the latter , including knock - out / overexpressed animal experiments , have demonstrated significant effects in septic shock ( nitric oxide inhibitors , activated protein c ) .
consequently , we must be creative in filling the gap between pathophysiological knowledge and evidence from animal models and almost consistently failed clinical trials .","None

"paget 's disease is a focal bone disorder manifested as bone overgrowth and disrupted bone integrity as a result of accelerated bone remodelling rate .
rarely , paget 's disease of the base of the skull results in hydrocephalic dementia , and the triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus syndrome is a much more scarce entity .
herein , we report an elderly woman who presented in imam khomeini hospital , tehran , iran , with normal pressure hydrocephalus syndrome due to paget 's bone disease . furthermore , we have reviewed relevant previous studies
paget 's disease of bone is considered as a focal disorder of bone metabolism , manifested as bone overgrowth and disrupted bone integrity as a result of accelerated bone remodeling rate .
this disorder is mainly asymptomatic and the overall age- and sex- standardized prevalence is estimated around 0.3% . to date , the etiology of paget 's disease remains unknown .
the major manifestations of paget 's disease of bone include pain , pathologic fractures , and skeletal deformities , especially at long bones , skull , and clavicles . furthermore , nerve entrapment by bone overgrowths results in diverse neurologic manifestations .
the disease is suspected when an isolated elevated serum alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphorus levels is observed .
bone scan is considered as the most sensitive diagnostic test in identifying pagetic bone lesions . 
 
hence , the presenting manifestation as normal pressure hydrocephalus is a much more scarce entity .
there is a scarcity of normal pressure hydrocephalus as presenting manifestation of paget 's disease .
therefore , we report a 66-year - old female presented to imam khomeini hospital , tehran , iran , with the chief complaint of urinary incontinence , gait abnormalities , and memory deficits . the brain ct scan revealed hydrocephalus in all supratentorial ventricles .
a 66-year - old woman was admitted to imam khomeini hospital with the chief complaint of gait difficulty since 6 years ago .
she had diabetes type ii , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and hypothyroidism in past medical history .
moreover , she had ischemic heart disease and a previous angiography had revealed stenosis , which was treated by percutaneous coronary intervention . the drug history comprised the following medications : amlodipine , losartan , atenolol , nitrocontin , glibenclamide , atorvastatin , metformin , and levothyroxine .
she also utilized hearing aids due to hearing problems . assessing the cerebellar function , the finger to nose and heel to shin tests were normal , while the tandem gait was disrupted .
cell blood count showed lymphocytosis of 42.1% with the white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 5500/l . the brain ct scan revealed thickened calvaria ( figure 1 ) . furthermore , hydrocephaly was detectable in all supratentorial ventricles , but the forth ventricle remained intact ( figure 2 ) , . besides , emphysema was observable in all subcutaneous areas around the skull and outside calvaria ( figure 1 ) .
mri showed periventricular leukoencephalopathy and increased marrow signal ( figure 2 ) . in order to assess the thickened calvaria ,
whole body scan was performed and the serum levels of calcium , phosphorous , and alkaline phosphatase were assessed .
thick skull in brain ct scan hydrocephalus with interstitial edema and increased bone marrow signal in t2 weighted mri in order to investigate the problem , cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) sample was collected after lumbar puncture . after the lumbar puncture the patient 's problems including recent memory deficits diminished for one day .
venereal disease research laboratory test ( vdrl ) and wright test of csf were negative .
paget 's disease of bone is considered as a disorder in bone metabolism which results in diverse neurologic symptoms .
pain is considered as one of the major symptoms which may arise from pagetic lesions , or may be the result of possible complications in adjacent tissues , such as arthritis or nerve impingemen .
these symptoms are mostly caused by nerve entrapment as a result of enlarged bone , or as an outcome of diminished blood supply .
our patient suffered from hearing loss which is recognized as a common presentation in about 37% of patients and is mainly caused by the compression of the 8 nerve .
moreover , the patient presented with facial palsy as a result of the compression of the 7 nerve .
hydrocephalus stems from the involvement of the skull base and the resultant blockage of the sylvius aqueduct .
the major initial presentation in our patient , at the time diagnosis , was dementia .
previously , there have been few reports of paget 's disease and associated normal pressure hydrocephalus .
hens and van den bergh reported a patient with the triad of dementia , urinary incontinence , and gait abnormality accompanied with obstructive hydrocephalu .
reported an elderly woman with ataxia and dementia , related to hydrocephalus , resulting from paget 's disease of the skull .
lobato et al . described a syndrome resembling normal pressure hydrocephalus due to paget 's bone disease .
reported an elderly woman with normal pressure hydrocephaly due to paget 's disease in 1994 . in 2000
chan et al . reported an elderly woman with the triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus presented 3 years after the diagnosis of the paget 's disease mainly affecting the skull .
reported a patient of normal pressure hydrocephalus , resulting from paget 's disease of the skull base in 2005 .
the reported patient was symptom free during the 6 years after a ventricular shunt was inserted . 
  in conclusion
, paget 's disease and nph could accompany each other , and hydrocephalus symptoms may unmask underlying paget 's disease .","Background

"the 
 -rearrangement of allylic ammonium ylides is a direct 
 and elegant method toward the synthesis of -amino acid derivatives 
 containing multiple stereocenters .
the 
 mechanism of this process , and that of the competitive -stevens 
 rearrangement , has been much discussed and disputed within the literature . 

a concerted thermally allowed sigmatropic process is thought to be 
 operative in the -rearrangement , while a radical mechanism involving 
 bond cleavage and recombination is usually favored for -rearrangement 
 ( scheme 1a ) . to date
, few mechanistic analyses 
 of -rearrangements of allylic 
 ammonium ylides have been conducted , although jacobsen and co - workers 
 have recently reported a detailed mechanistic investigation into the 
 related thiourea - catalyzed -wittig rearrangement .
the elegant experimental and computational work of singleton 
 and co - workers concerning the competitive - and -rearrangements 
 of allylic ammonium ylides promoted by dbu represents the current 
 state - of - the - art ( scheme 1b ) . through c kinetic isotope effects , crossover 
 experiments , and computation ,
these studies demonstrate that the origin 
 of competitive - and -rearrangement is the common loose 
 transition state leading to dynamic bond cleavage .
the development of both catalytic and stereoselective variants 
 of the -rearrangement of allylic ammonium ylides has been a significant 
 synthetic challenge .
tambar and co - workers have reported a tandem 
 ammonium salt formation and diastereoselective -rearrangement 
 process , exploiting pd - catalyzed allylic substitution to form the 
 reactive ammonium salt in situ , giving ( )-anti--amino acid derivatives with excellent diastereocontrol 
 via proposed transition state 13 ( scheme 2a ) .
the observed 
 diastereoselectivity of this -rearrangement process , and indeed 
 most -rearrangements , can be rationalized through the exo- or endo- transition states 15 and 17 initially described by houk and marshall for 
 the related -wittig rearrangement ( scheme 2b ) .
prior to our studies within this area , only limited methods 
 capable 
 of imparting enantiocontrol in the -rearrangement of allylic 
 ammonium ylides had been developed .
sweeney first demonstrated a chiral 
 auxiliary approach to allow access to enantiomerically enriched -amino 
 acid derivatives , while the use of a superstoichiometric 
 chiral lewis acid promoter was subsequently reported by somfai .
catalytic enantioselective variants were unknown 
 until 2014 , when our laboratory reported an isothiourea - catalyzed -rearrangement of allylic quaternary ammonium 
 salts to give syn--amino acid derivatives 
 with excellent levels of diastereo- and enantiocontrol ( scheme 3 ) .
treatment of quaternary ammonium salts 19 bearing an 
 activated p - nitrophenol ester , either isolated or 
 generated in situ , with catalytic ( + ) -benzotetramisole 
 ( ( + ) -btm ) 20 , cocatalytic hydroxybenzotriazole 
 ( hobt ) , and ipr2nh , gave stereoselective 
 -rearrangement into syn--amino acid derivatives 
 with excellent levels of stereocontrol .
this process can be performed 
 in the absence of hobt ; however , its addition provides a subtle enhancement 
 in both diastereo- and enantioselectivity .
we tentatively proposed 
 a lewis base catalytic cycle , initiated by nucleophilic addition of 
 ( + ) -btm 20 into the activated ester substrate to form 
 an acyl ammonium intermediate prior to the formation of ammonium ylide 22 .
however , alternative mechanistic pathways using either 
 lewis or brnsted base catalysis proceeding via different intermediates 
 can be envisaged ( scheme 3 ) .
for example , assuming lewis base catalysis is operative , 
 the reaction could proceed through initial formation of a ketene intermediate 23 en route to acyl ammonium ylide 22 .
furthermore , 
 the origin of the observed diastereo- and enantiocontrol in the rearrangement 
 process is currently unknown .
herein we report experimental 
 and computational investigations 
 into the mechanism and origins of stereocontrol in the isothiourea - catalyzed 
 -rearrangement of allylic ammonium ylides ( scheme 1c ) . in situ nmr analysis 

has allowed a reaction profile to be elucidated , while isotopic - labeling 
 studies have unambiguously identified a genuine productive catalytic 
 intermediate .
kinetic analysis has given insight into the overall 
 process , and crossover studies have provided information about the 
 reversibility of each step .
kinetic isotope effects have also been 
 used to probe the stereodetermining -rearrangement step of the 
 process .
computational reaction coordinate modeling provides deeper 
 insight into the catalytic cycle , and transition state modeling reveals 
 the origins of stereochemical control .
initial studies aimed 
 to establish the kinetics of the -rearrangement 
 and identify any reaction intermediate(s ) or catalyst resting states . 
 ammonium salt 25a ( 34 mm ) rearranges to 26a in d3-mecn / d6-dmso ( 9:1 ) at 20 c , catalyzed by ( + ) -btm 20 ( 20 mol % ) ( scheme 4 ) .
the  presence of various salts in the reaction medium causes 
 extensive line broadening in the h nmr spectrum , making 
 it unsuitable for in situ analysis of the -rearrangement . 

however , the f{h } and c{h } nmr spectra were tractable , and the 4-fluoro substituent 
 in 25a allows quantitative monitoring of the process 
 by in situf{h } nmr ( f = 113.1 ppm ) , with phcf3 as an internal 
 standard .
after an initial burst phase 
 ( < 1000 s ) , ammonium salt 25a is converted into 26a ( > 80% 26a , f = 117.6 
 ppm ) with pseudo - first - order kinetics , vide infra , over a period of 4 h. during the reaction evolution , a transient 
 species ( f = 117.0 ppm ) was detected , accumulating 
 to a maximum concentration of 5.2 mm in the early stages of 
 catalysis and then depleting as substrate 25a was consumed . 

rearrangement in the absence of hobt resulted in a similar reaction 
 profile , but afforded higher concentrations of the same species ( f = 117.0 ppm ) , over a longer period , assisting in 
 its analysis . to determine 
 if the transient species ( f = 117.0 ppm ) 
 involves the catalyst , a fluorinated variant , ( + ) -f - btm 27 , was prepared.in situ monitoring of the -rearrangement of 25a , catalyzed by 27 ( figure 1 ) , confirmed conversion of free ( + ) -f - btm 27 ( f = 123.3 ppm ) into a catalyst - derived 
 species ( f = 113.4 ppm ) , which was also 
 transient , reaching a maximum concentration of 4.6 mm at 2500 
 s , and decaying as the reaction proceeds to completion ( see inset 
 graph to figure 1 ) . 

the comparable temporal intensities of the two signals ( f = 117.0 ppm and 113.4 ppm ) strongly suggest 
 they arise from a single transient intermediate containing both 25a and 27 in a formal 1:1 combination . based 
 on reference to isothiouronium salt 28
( f = 113.3 ppm ) , the f chemical shift of the catalyst - derived 
 component in transient species 29 suggested it to be 
 an n - acylated isothiourea .

isotopically labeled substrates and catalyst 
 ( 1-[c1]-25a , 1,2-[c2]-25a , 1,2,3-[c3]-25b ( figure 2a ) and ( )-[n1]-27 ) were prepared to deduce connectivity 
 between various atoms in the intermediate and probe for reversibility 
 in its generation .
rearrangement of 1,2-[c2]-25a ( 34 mm ) catalyzed by ( )-[n1]-27 ( 6.8 mm , 20 mol % ) was monitored by c{h } nmr ( figure 2b ) .
reducing the ipr2nh 
 concentration to 23.8 mm prolonged the lifetime of the intermediate , 
 [ n1,c2]-29a , allowing detailed analysis of the c = o region , figure 2c .
the characteristic 
 doublets ( jcc = 52 hz ) arising 
 from the adjacent c labels , c(1)c(2 ) , in the 
 substrate ( 1,2-[c2]-25a ) and 
 the product ( 1,2-[c2]-26a ) are 
 replaced by a double  doublet in [ n1 , c2]-29a ( c = 173.1 ppm ) .
the magnitude of the 
 c  c coupling ( jcc = 
 52 hz ) confirms that c(2 ) remains sp - hybridized . the magnitude 
 of the additional coupling constant ( jcn = 5.2 hz ) indicates that 
 c(1 ) is directly bound to the n - labeled atom in the catalyst , 
 confirming 29a to be an n - acylated isothiourea 
 ( figure 2 ) .

attempts to identitify the atom adjacent to c(2 ) 
 in [ n1 , c2]-29a from 
 its h - coupled c nmr signal were thwarted 
 by line broadening .
instead , the c{h } nmr spectrum of intermediate 1,2,3-[c3]-29b , generated from 1,2,3-[c3]-25b , was analyzed ( figure 3 ) .
the c(2 ) signal of the resulting 
 -rearrangement product 1,2,3-[c3]-26b ( c = 70.5 ppm ) displayed the expected 
 double  doublet coupling arising from c(2)c(3 ) bond 
 formation .
however , this coupling pattern was also evident in intermediate 
 1,2,3-[c3]-29b ( c = 68.0 ppm , jcc 51.4 hz , jcc 35.8 hz ) with the magnitude 
 of the c(2)c(3 ) coupling indicative of sp - hybdrization 
 at both centers .

 that the intermediate ( 29 ) is a catalyst - bound , post -- rearrangement ,

the data presented so far does not discriminate 
 between the n - acylated isothiourea species ( 29 ) being peripheral 
 to the productive catalytic cycle ( figure 4 , case a ) or an integral part of it ( cases 
 b  d ) .
a catalytic reaction employing 1-[c1]-25a ( 17 mm ) was allowed to evolve until 
 1-[c1]-29a had reached its maximum 
 concentration ( 5 mm ) .
a further 1.0 equiv ( 17 mm ) of a differently 
 labeled substrate , 1,2-[c2]-25a , was then rapidly added , resulting in an isotopic perturbation of 
 the system . at the point that 1,2-[c2]-25a is added , there has been 32% net conversion of 25a ( [ c1]- and [ c2]- ) . 

however , neither of the -rearrangement products ( 29a and 26a ) yet contain any of the [ c2]-label : all of this resides in unreacted [ c1,2]-25a , which comprises 0.28 [ c1]/0.72 [ c2 ] .
the key features are 
 the changes in c2-populations in the substrate 25a , intermediate 29a and product 26a , as the reaction evolves . irrespective of the pathway ( a  d ) 

the population in the final product ( 26a ) must ultimately 
 rise from 0% to 50% , as dictated by the equal proportions of 1-[c1]-25a and 1,2-[c2]-25a added overall . for case
a , where 29a is not productive , the isotope population in 29a will depend only on that of the final product ( 26a ; 
 max 50% c2 ) and at all stages will be lower 
 or equal to it . for case
b , where the intermediate is productive , 
 but is in equilibrium with 25a , the c2-population in 25a will be reduced , in the limit 
 from 72% to 55% . for cases
c and d , where the -rearrangement 
 to 29a is irreversible , the isotope population in 25a is constant ( 72% c2- ) and the c2-content in 29a rises from 0% to 
 a maximum of 72% as it is repopulated from 25a .
however , for case c , equilbration of 29a with product 26a will attenuate the rise in c2-population in 29a , in the limit to 50% . 
 only for case d will the c2 isotope population 
 in 29a rise , in advance of 26a , to reach 
 a maximum 72% c2 .
comparison of the predicted and experimentally determined c2-populations as a function of net conversion ( figure 4 ) confirms that 26 arises from two irreversible sequential first - order interconversions 
 ( 25  29  26 ) where 29 is the productive catalytic intermediate 
 ( case d ) . kinetic modeling confirms that 
 the impact of heavy - atom ( c / c ) kies on the 
 isotope - entrainment are negligible .

 d ; with rate ratio 0.407 ) .
hobt provides optimal diastereo- and 
 enantiocontrol ( scheme 4 ) ; however , its role within 
 the catalytic cycle is unclear . to probe
if the hobt enhances stereocontrol 
 via suppression of the base - mediated background reaction , the ipr2nh - mediated rearrangement of 25a was examined .
reaction of 25a with ipr2nh ( 47 mm ) in the absence of the btm catalyst resulted 
 in slow formation of racemic 26a with low diastereocontrol 
 ( 79:21 dr ) and a kobs of 2.74  10 s. the addition of a catalytic 
 amount of hobt ( 6.8 mm ) resulted in no change in rate ( kobs 2.70  10 s ) .
this rules out the role of hobt as improving stereocontrol through direct suppression of the rate of the background reaction .
the ( + ) -btm - catalyzed rearrangement of 25a in the 
 presence of stoichiometric hobt ( 34 mm ) was studied by f{h } nmr .
the presence of hobt strongly suppressed accumulation 
 of acyl ammonium intermediate 29c ( ( + ) -btm replaces ( + ) -f - btm ) 
 and resulted in the formation of the corresponding hobt ester 30 ( f = 117.2 ppm , confirmed by 
 comparison with an authentic sample ) , in addition to the pnpo ester product 26a .
addition 
 of hobt once the acyl ammonium intermediate 29c reached 
 the pseudo steady - state ( 5 mm , t = 3920 s , figure 5 ) resulted in immediate formation of hobt ester 30 and 
 consumption of acyl ammonium intermediate 29c .
hobt thus 
 shifts the catalyst speciation to be strongly dominated by free ( + ) -btm 
 ( figure 5 ) .
the background ipr2nh - mediated reaction that converts 25 into racemic ( )-26 presumably 
 involves the generation of ylide intermediate 24 .
interception 
 of this species by free ( + ) -btm would also generate intermediate 29 , thus leading to nonracemic 26 .
addition 
 of stoichiometric hobt at t = 3920 s. 
 conditions : 25a ( 34 mm ) , ( + ) -btm ( 6.8 mm ) , ipr2nh ( 47.6 mm ) , d3-mecn / d6-dmso ( 9:1 ) , hobt ( 34 mm ) .
overall , the beneficial effect of hobt on the selectivity 
 may arise 
 from both a change in catalyst speciation to favor free btm and by diversion of the background reaction onto the enantioselective 
 pathway ( scheme 5 ) . having identified , by f{h } and c{h } nmr , the major reactant - derived and catalyst - derived 
 components present in the reaction mixture , the empirical rate equation 
 was established by analysis of the decay in substrate 25a during the pseudosteady - state phase of the catalysis ( scheme 6 ) .
the standard conditions [ 25a ( 34 mm ) , ( + ) -btm ( 6.8 
 mm ) , hobt ( 6.8 mm ) , and ipr2nh ( 47 mm ) ] , 
 afforded a pseudo - first - order rate constant , kobs = 1.37  10 s. d[26a]/dt = kobs[25a ] ; kobs = k[btm][nr3 ] . conditions : 25a ( 1768 
 mm ) , ( + ) -btm ( 1.713.6 mm ) , hobt ( 034 mm ) , ipr2nh ( 23.895.2 mm ) , d3-mecn / d6-dmso ( 9:1 ) , 253 
 k , 4 h. there was a linear relationship between 
 the enantiopurity of ( + ) -btm 
 and product 26a , consistent with predominant or exclusive 
 speciation of the catalyst in an active , monomeric , form .
systematic variation of the concentration of 
 the reaction components afforded empirical first - order dependencies 
 on ( + ) -btm ( 1.713.6 mm ) and diisopropylamine ( 23.895.2 
 mm ) , with no rate impact from the hobt ( 034 mm ) .
addition 
 of n - bu4n 4-nitrophenoxide ( 27.2 mm ) in 
 the absence of hobt resulted in a large increase in rate ( kobs = 2.42  10 s ) and reduced the accumulation of the -rearrangement 
 acyl ammonium intermediate 29c ( 2 mm ) . control 
 studies showed that n - bu4nbr ( 27.2 mm ) 
 resulted in a similar rate enhancement ( kobs = 2.35  10 s ) but 
 did not suppress the accumulation of 29c ( 5 mm ) .
the 
 observed increase in kobs may be rationalized 
 by an increase in ionic strength of the medium .
the n - bu4n 4-nitrophenoxide 
 thus promotes catalyst turnover of acyl ammonium 29c into 
 product 26a and ( + ) -btm .
addition of 4-nitrophenol ( 034 
 mm ) resulted in a decrease in rate , with a negative first - order dependency . 

overall , this suggests that 4-nitrophenoxide or benzotriazololate 
 is required for efficient turnover of acyl ammonium 29c into products 26a/30 and ( + ) -btm .
although it 
 is clear that the -rearrangement to generate 29 is 
 irreversible , it is not evident whether this is the 
 product - determining step , i.e. the first irreversible 
 step in the cycle . during the -rearrangement step , the carbon 
 that becomes c(3)h in 29 undergoes rehybridization 
 from sp to sp
the process to generate a c(3)d 
 isotopologue of 29 would be thus expected to exhibit 
 a h - skie . alternatively ,
if deprotonation at c(2)h 
 to generate an allylic ammonium ylide ( scheme 3 ) was the product - determining step , there 
 would not be any significant skie , as c(3)d is remote .
the skie was measured by competition using aryl - d1-c(3)-d0 - 25a and aryl - d0-c(3)-d1 - 25a , in a double - labeling 
 method in which the c(3)d / c(3)h 
 ratio as a function of fractional conversion is determined by f nmr ( f = 0.28 ppm ; aryl - d0/aryl - d1 ) . after correction 
 for the effect of aryl deuteration
the presence of a small positive skie is consistent with 
 a product - determining -rearrangement transition state ( scheme 7 ) .
a linear free 
 energy relationship analysis of a range of c(3)-aryl substrates , against 
 standard hammett sigma values , showed the c(3 ) position to be relatively 
 insensitive to electronic substituent effects .
we have previously 
 demonstrated the -rearrangement step to be 
 intramolecular and irreversible . to distinguish 
 which steps prior to the -rearrangement are reversible , a crossover 
 reaction between ammonium salts 25a and 31 ( 1:1 ) bearing two distinct activated ester groups ( 4-no2c6h4 and 3,5-(cf3)2c6h3 ) and two distinct c(3)-aryl units ( 4-fc6h4 and 3-fc6h4 ) was monitored in situ under catalytic conditions ( scheme 8a ) .
complete equilibration with ammonium 
 salts 32 and 33 was observed , consistent with reversible generation of nonrearranged 
 ( + ) -btm acyl ammonium intermediates .
to  examine reversibility 
 at the deprotonation step , the -rearrangement of -dideuterio 
 ammonium salt -[d2]-25 ( 75% d2 ) was monitored in situ .
the product was obtained 
 with significantly lower deuterium incorporation ( 29% d ) , consistent 
 with a reversible deprotonation step ( scheme 8b ) .
reaction 
 of ammonium salt 33 in the presence of rearrangement 
 product 26b ( scheme 8c ) bearing distinct c(3)-aryl units and activated esters 
 demonstrated no crossover , consistent with catalyst turnover being 
 irreversible , confirming the conclusions deduced from isotopic entrainment .
( i ) ( + ) -btm ( 20 mol % ) , ipr2nh ( 1.4 equiv ) , 25a ( 0.5 equiv ) , 31 ( 0.5 equiv ) , d3-mecn / d6-dmso ( 9:1 ) , 253 k , 4 h ; ( ii ) ( + ) -btm ( 20 mol 
 % ) , hobt ( 20 mol % ) , ipr2nh ( 1.4 equiv ) , 26b ( 0.5 equiv ) , 33 ( 0.5 equiv ) , mecn , 253 k. we computed 
 all intermediates , transition structures ( tss ) , and possible salt 
 complexes involved in the catalytic cycle shown in scheme 9 .
geometries and thermodynamic 
 corrections were computed at the m06 - 2x/6 - 31g(d ) level of theory .
vibrational frequencies and thermal corrections 
 to the gibbs free energy were calculated at 20 c and 
 1 atm to match the experimental conditions .
further energy refinements 
 were completed using m06 - 2x/6 - 311++g(2df , p ) .
implicit solvation corrections were applied using the polarized 
 continuum model ( pcm ) with uff radii 
 for acetonitrile in both the geometry optimizations and the single - point 
 energy refinements .
the hybrid meta - gga functional m06 - 2x is generally 
 more robust than b3lyp at accounting for dispersion and nonbonding 
 interactions routinely found in organocatalytic reactions .
kinetic isotope effects were calculated using 
 the theory of bigeleisen and mayer along 
 with the rigid - rotor harmonic oscillator approach ( hs ) .
quantum mechanical tunneling effects were also calculated for both 
 methods using the one - dimensional parabolic approximation .
the calculation of the kie was automated by 
 use of the onyx isotope effect program .
direct acylation begins with btm attack on allylic 
 ammonium activated 
 substrate ( ts - ii , g = 14.8 kcalmol ) to form tetrahedral intermediate iii . release of pnpo ( ts - iv , g = 12.0 kcalmol ) gives dication v. indirect acylation 
 through formation of the ammonium ketene iii was 
 ruled an unlikely reactive intermediate based on its unfavorable thermodynamics 
 ( g = 22.0 kcalmol ) .
the endergonicity of dication v ( g = 3.3 kcalmol ) confirms the observed reversibility of catalyst acylation .
dication v is in equilibrium with ylide vii ( g = 1.6 kcalmol ) through deprotonation 
 of the -proton of v by pnpo ( g = 11.4 kcalmol ) , also in agreement with the experimentally observed 
 reversibility of the deprotonation step .
nbo analyses reveal significant enolate character of ylide 
 intermediate vii . intermediate vii subsequently 
 undergoes 
 stereoselective and turnover - rate limiting -rearrangement ( ts - viii-(2s,3s)-major , g = 17.3 kcalmol ) to 
 yield enantio- and diastereoenriched acyl ammonium product 
catalyst turnover is found to be stepwise , 
 begins with pnpo attack ( ts - x ) and 
 ends with catalyst and product release ( ts - xii ) .
the 
 barrier for pnpo attack as calculated from intermediate ix ( g = 16.9 kcalmol ) indicates that , in the absence of hobt , this step 
 is highly competitive with rearrangement as turnover - rate limiting .
the presence of counterions posed a challenge to the 
 accuracy of dft and significantly increased the complexity of the 
 conformational search and the number of relevant structures to consider .
almost all species present in the catalytic 
 cycle prior to catalyst turnover bear a positive charge , with intermediate v being dicationic .
species indicated to include a counterion 
 in scheme 9 were optimized 
 with the explicit ion shown .
given the charged nature of the species 
 present , the identification of the structures that compose the free 
 energy span resulted from considering 
 all possible counterion coordination combinations for all conformations 
 of each charged species in the catalytic cycle .
this exhaustive process 
 led to the identification of acyl substrate i and ts - viii as the two states contributing to the free energy 
 span .
computed barriers show the rearrangement step as the first irreversible 
 step of the mechanism , thereby allowing kinetic isotopic fractionation 
 to occur .
the computed kie then depends on the vibrational frequencies 
 of i and ts - viii , and could then be utilized 
 to corroborate the computed thermodynamics and barriers of this free 
 energy span . in a multistep reaction 
 with highly charged and zwitterionic species ,
leveraging kie prescribes 
 a means to identify not only the structures that compose the free 
 energy span but also which ions coordinate , 
 the specific binding site of the counterion , and the conformation .
we sought to identify 
 the coordination state of ts - viii by leveraging both 
 the kie and computed barriers for ts - viii - f , i.e. bearing 
 the 4-fluoro substituent used for kie determination ( scheme 7 ) .
coordination to ts - viii - f , formation of byproduct salt complexes , and conformations all affect 
 the barrier in going from i - f to ts - viii - f .
two possible counterions , pnpo and br , were considered as ts counterions , while ipr2nh2 was evaluated as a component of 
 the possible remaining complexes ( figure 6 ) .
no coordination to the ts ( figure 6 , left ) leaves h - bond complex pnpohipr2nh as the lowest - energy 
 remaining complex , giving an overall g = 18.3 kcalmol .
bromide 
 ion binding to the ts ( ts - viii - f-(2s,3s)br , figure 6 , middle ) 
 also leaves complex pnpohipr2nh ( g = 18.7 kcalmol ) .
pnpo binding and the complexation 
 of ipr2nh2 and 
 br gives an even higher barrier ( ts - viii - f-(2s,3s)pnpo , g = 22.8 kcalmol ) . with 
 no counterion coordination to the ts ( ts - viii - f-(2s,3s)-major ) , the kiecomp of 1.028 matches
bromide complexation , 
 which is 0.4 kcalmol higher , also matches 
 fairly closely , giving a kiecomp of 1.041 .
pnpo complexation leads to an erroneously 
 large magnitude of rate difference between kh / kd , yielding a kiecomp of 1.050 .
computed tss , ions , complexes , and kies involving the 4-fluoro 
 substituted substrate i - f .
the computed kie depends on 
 the coordination state of substrate i - f and ts - viii - f .
green lines 
 represent c  h electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds . stereodetermining -rearrangement tss .
the four main elements that control the stereochemical outcome of 
 the reaction are as follows ( figure 8) : computed model systems ( all energies in kcalmol and distances in  ) .
( a ) preference for z over e enolate . enolate - like character 
 indicated by bond orders 
 ( b. o. ) estimated from the wiberg bond indices ( bottom left inset ) . 

( c ) with the acylated catalyst conformation held rigid 
 ( so ) , the btm stereodirecting ph sterically biases 
 open enolate face .
nbo analysis indicates 
 that both ylide vii and ts - viii-(2s,3s)-major have 
 significant enolate character .
ylide vii displays a c  o 
 bond order of 1.39 and a c  c bond order of 1.52 ( figure 8 , bottom left inset ) , while ts - viii-(2s,3s)-major displays a c  o bond order of 1.54 
 and a c  c bond order of 1.21 .
the 
 computed bond order of 1.52 for ylide vii suggests partial 
 c  c double bond character leading to distinct isomeric e and z enolate configurations prior to 
 rearrangement with the configurations set in place by the deprotonation 
 step . the z - configuration is heavily favored over 
 the e , as shown in the model system z / e-35 where the z is favored by > 16 kcalmol .
all stable -rearrangement transition structures 
 feature the z - enolate . in all the lowest energy conformations 
 of the ylide - vii and rearrangement ts - viii , the s 
the syn distances ( 2.72.8 
  ) are significantly below the sum of the van der waals radii 
 ( 3.4  ) , indicating close - contact so interactions 
 ( figures 7 and 8 , orange lines ) .
computed model systems show > 4 kcalmol preference for the conformation which contains the 1,5-so 
 interaction ( anti / syn-36 , figure 8) .
all -rearrangement tss that do not 
 bear the so interaction are higher by > 6 kcalmol . the conformational 
 bias toward the s  osyn arrangement is proposed to result from no to *c  s delocalization coupled with electrostatic attraction 
 of the partially positive sulfur atom and partially negative oxygen 
 atom .
the so 
 interaction significantly rigidifies the ylide - vii structure , 
 leaving conformational freedom only to 
 the substrate cinnamyl group . with rearrangement possible from either 
 face of the catalyst isothiourea plane , the facial selectivity is 
 controlled by the catalyst ph stereodirecting group .
the most favorable 
 -tss favor approach opposite to this group ( ts - viii-(2s,3s)-major and ts - viii-(2s,3r ) , figure 7 ) .
approach on the same side as the stereodirecting ph is disfavored 
 by > 6 kcalmol ( ts - viii-(2r,3r ) and ts - viii-(2r,3s ) ) .
rearrangement can occur 
 either endo or exo with respect 
 to the substrate c = o 
 ( figure 8) . in the 
 simple allyl model ts ,
this 
 preference is 2 kcalmol between ts - viii-(2s,3s)-major and ts - viii-(2s,3r ) , and additional interactions contribute to 
 the diastereoselectivity . in the major ts
there is a cation 
 interaction , which is favored over the 
 -c  h interaction found in the minor .
truncated fully optimized model systems probing the difference 
 in energy between these interactions in the context of cationic btm 
 reveal a 1 kcalmol preference for 38 -cation over 38 -c  h ( figure 8 , bottom right 
 inset ) .
these two factors contribute 
 to the computed 2 kcalmol preference for ts - viii-(2s,3s)-major over ts - viii-(2s,3r ) , in good agreement with the experimental 
 selectivity of 1.5 kcalmol .
the experimental and computational 
 investigation reported herein 
 has provided mechanistic and stereochemical insight into the enantioselective 
 isothiourea - catalyzed -rearrangement of allylic ammonium ylides . 

analysis by in situf nmr has allowed 
 reaction profiles to be established and has identified an intermediate 
 species .
isotopic labeling of catalyst ( n ) and 
 substrate ( c ) has confirmed the constitution of the catalytic 
 intermediate 
 as 29/ix by c nmr .
isotopic 
 entrainment has shown 29/ix to be an irreversibly 
 generated intermediate that is productive toward catalysis .
a series 
 of crossover experiments have provided detailed information regarding 
 the reversibility of each individual step of the catalytic cycle . 

the turnover - rate limiting step of the process varies between product 
 release and -rearrangement , depending on substrate conversion . 
 the effect of excess hobt upon the reaction is to accelerate product 
 release , thus generating a greater proportion of the free btm catalyst 
 ( figure 5 )
this may 
 then result in more effective interception of the background racemic 
 reaction , and thus greater diversion onto the enantioselective pathway 
 ( scheme 5 ) .
computational 
 analysis has provided finer detail for the fundamental steps in the 
 catalytic cycle as well as the key interactions that control the stereochemical 
 outcome of the process .
the insight gained into this process will 
 have implications in a wider context , especially in the use of activated 
 esters in lewis base catalysis , which is currently under investigation 
 in our laboratories .","Introduction

"aids is a major public health challenge in sub - saharan africa , and the prevalence of other stis in the region is high [ 1 , 2 ] .
an estimated 22.9 million people infected with hiv live in sub - saharan africa , and approximately 1.2 million deaths from aids occurred in sub - saharan africa .
stis facilitate the sexual acquisition and transmission of hiv infection and hiv infection increases the risk of other stis [ 4 , 5 ] .
hence , the recognition , treatment , and prevention of stis to reduce the risk of hiv transmission should be a public health priority , especially in sub - saharan africa where antiretroviral therapy may not be readily available .
more than two - thirds of patients living with hiv in sub - saharan africa have no access to antiretroviral therapy .
stis can be diagnosed in a number of different ways , including laboratory and syndromic diagnosis .
however , it is expensive and is not feasible in many settings as it requires sophisticated laboratory facilities and qualified personnel who can perform technically demanding procedures .
moreover , laboratory diagnosis of stis is time - consuming and results often can not be made available at the same visit , thereby causing a delay in treatment initiation . for these reasons ,
the syndromic diagnosis of stis remains the only feasible option in some resource - limited settings .
syndromic diagnosis of stis is based on the identification of a group of symptoms and signs that characterize a clinical condition [ 7 , 8 ] .
it is simple , cost effective , and capable of yielding rapid diagnosis for immediate treatment .
moreover , this technique can be implemented at all levels of the health care system . despite these advantages
, it has several limitations : syndromic diagnosis relies on subjective judgment , can not detect asymptomatic infections , and may result in overdiagnosis / overtreatment and potential drug resistance [ 911 ] . due to a lack of trained personnel and adequate laboratory infrastructure in sub - saharan africa , information regarding the profile of stis relies essentially on self - reported or physician - diagnosed stis .
however , there is still no consensus on its performance and several studies from the region have reported inconsistent results .
the mixed reports might be due to the fact that the studies were carried out in particular groups that are not representative of the overall population , such as std or antenatal clinic attendees [ 1214 ] .
therefore , there is a public health need to evaluate the validity of the syndromic diagnosis of stis using population - based studies from the region , that is , the urgent need for a comparative study of syndromic and laboratory diagnosis of stis in sub - saharan africa .
the main objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of syndromic diagnosis of stis in comparison with laboratory - confirmed stis .
the study participants consisted of 2,019 women who were enrolled in a community - based survey , which was conducted from november 2002 to march 2003 in the moshi urban district of the kilimanjaro region .
the kilimanjaro region , located in northern tanzania adjacent to the kenyan border , is one of mainland tanzania 's 20 regions and is experiencing a mature generalized stage of the hiv epidemic .
tanzania , with a population of 34.5 million , has about 7% of its adults infected with hiv . in the moshi district of northern tanzania
study participants were selected to participate in the survey based on a two - stage sampling design . during the first stage of sampling , a total of 150 clusters were selected from the moshi urban district . in the second stage of sampling
, a number of households were randomly selected from each of the 150 clusters and 2,019 women who were residents of the households were enrolled . a detailed description of the study protocol , data gathering instruments , and procedures and laboratory methods has been previously published [ 16 , 17 ] .
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics including age , education , ethnicity , religion , and occupation were obtained .
high - risk behaviors including alcohol abuse , age at first sex , number of sexual partners , and frequency of condom use were obtained .
symptoms of stis including abdominal pain , abnormal genital discharge , foul smell in the genital area , excessive genital secretions , swelling of lymphnodes in the genital area , itching in the genital area , burning pain on micturation , pain during intercourse , and genital ulcers were obtained .
blood and urine samples were obtained from 1,418 and 1,440 women , respectively , who agreed to further testing for stis .
the blood samples were tested for hiv-1 , hsv-2 , and active and past syphilis .
the urine samples were tested for chlamydia , gonorrhea , trichomonas , and mycoplasma genitalium .  
descriptive measures ( such as mean , median , standard deviation , interquartile range , frequencies , and percentages ) were used to summarize the data .
sensitivity and specificity together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of each stis symptom .
exact binomial confidence intervals were used to estimate confidence intervals for rates of stis , sensitivities , and specificities .
kendall 's tau - b was used to measure agreements between patient - reported stis symptoms and laboratory confirmed stis .
the reported numbers of stis symptoms were summed to obtain the total number of stis symptoms for each participant .
receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve was then constructed using sensitivity and specificity obtained from every possible symptom threshold .
the area under the roc curve ( auroc ) was used to evaluate the overall diagnostic accuracy of the syndromic diagnosis of stis .
we restricted our analysis to women who were tested for stis ; a total of 1,520 women were tested for stis .
the median age was 28 years ( iqr = 2335 ) , and median age at first sex was 19 years ( iqr = 1721 ) .
the majority of study participants had pre - secondary education ( 77% ) , had not used a condom in the prior 12 months ( 77% ) , had one sex partner in the last three years ( 84% ) , and had a husband / partner ( 61% ) .
figure 1 displays the rates of stis symptoms and tests among the women included in the analysis .
the prevalence rates of hsv-2 , hiv-1 , and trichomonas were 43% , 11% , and 11% , respectively .
the prevalence rates of the other stis were below 5.0% . among the tested women , 30% reported at least one stis symptom .
the most prevalent stis symptom was lower abdominal pain ( 16% ) , followed by itching in the genital area ( 15% ) , pain during intercourse ( 9.4% ) , abnormal genital discharge ( 6.3% ) , burning or pain on micturation ( 6% ) , excessive genital secretions ( 4.1% ) , foul smell in genital area ( 3.2% ) , swelling of lymphnodes in genital area ( 1.9% ) , and genital ulcers ( 1.1% ) .
the prevalence of stis symptoms among women tested positive for each sti is presented in figure 2 .
figure 3 displays a heat map of kendall 's tau - b correlation coefficients used to measure agreements between patient - reported stis symptoms and laboratory - confirmed results .
kendall 's tau - b value of 1 implies perfect agreement and values less than 1 imply less than perfect agreement .
the kendall 's tau - b coefficients were low ( range = 0.040.08 ) , showing no significant associations between each sti symptom and the laboratory - confirmed sti results . when the symptoms were combined together and summed , the level of agreement between stis symptoms and tests remained low ( kendall 's tau - b = 0.07 , 95% ci : 0.020.12 ) . 

figure 4 displays the sensitivity ( true positive rate ) and specificity ( true negative rate ) of each sti symptom , where sensitivity is the ability of an sti symptom to correctly identify women who have laboratory - confirmed stis and specificity is the ability of an sti symptom to correctly identify women without laboratory - confirmed stis .
the individual sti symptoms had very low sensitivity ( range = 2%17% ) and high specificity ( range = 85%99% ) .
the less sensitive sti symptoms identified individuals as being disease - free when in fact they were not . moreover , the more specific stis symptoms identified individuals as being disease - free when they were disease - free .
figure 4 also displays the sensitivity and specificity of the combined stis symptoms , which was defined as a positive response to at least one of the reported symptoms .
the sensitivity and specificity of the combined stis symptoms were 0.33 [ 95% ci : 0.300.37 ] and 0.73 [ 95% ci : 0.700.77 ] .
the combined stis symptoms correctly identified 33 out of 100 women with laboratory - confirmed stis and resulted in a 67% false negative rate .
similarly , the combined stis symptoms correctly identified 73 out of 100 healthy women and resulted in 27% false positive rate .  
the closer the auroc value is to 1 , the better the syndromic diagnosis of stis is .
the auroc was 0.53 ( 95% ci : 0460.62 ) ; that is , the syndromic approach had a 53% probability of correctly distinguishing a healthy from an infected woman .
the 95% ci included 50% , indicating that there is no gain in predictive accuracy by using stis symptoms .
the syndromic approach showed no advantage over random guess ( a random classifier has an auroc of 0.5 ) .
our study aimed to evaluate the accuracy ( performance ) of syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) among women in sub - saharan africa .
it included 1,520 women who were enrolled in a community - based survey from the moshi urban district of northern tanzania .
half of the women tested positive for at least one sti , while 30% reported at least one stis symptom .
the most prevalent sti among the study participants was hsv-2 ( reaching 43% ) , followed by hiv and trichomonas infection rates of 11% .
the prevalence rates of other stis were mycoplasma genitalium ( 3.2% ) , syphilis ( 2.5% ) , chlamydia ( 1.8% ) , and gonorrhea ( 0.2% ) .
the most prevalent sti symptom was lower abdominal pain ( 16% ) , followed by itching in the genital area ( 15% ) , pain during intercourse ( 9% ) , abnormal genital discharge ( 6% ) , and burning or pain on micturation ( 6% ) .
we found no significant associations between patient - reported stis symptoms and laboratory - confirmed stis tests .
furthermore , we found that the individual stis symptoms had high specificity and poor sensitivity .
the sensitivity ( specificity ) of each symptom independently ranged from 2 to 17% ( 8599% ) .
the less sensitive stis symptoms identified women as being infection - free when in fact they were not ( high false - negative results ) .
the more specific stis symptoms identified women as infection - free when they were infection - free ( low false - positive results ) . when the individual stis were used together
, the combined stis symptoms showed poor sensitivity of 33% and moderate specificity of 73% .
nearly 67% of the infected women were missed and almost 27% of the women who report stis symptoms were infection - free .
the choice of less sensitive versus more specific tests depends on whether one wants to exclude a dangerous disease or avoid a dangerous therapy .
a test 's sensitivity ( specificity ) becomes particularly important when one is seeking to exclude a dangerous disease ( to confirm a diagnosis that requires dangerous therapy ) .
several previous studies from sub - saharan african countries and other parts of the world have reported inconsistent results on the performance of stis symptoms .
clark et al .   evaluated the diagnostic performance of self - reported stis symptoms among high - risk men and women in peru .
the authors reported that the stis symptoms had low sensitivity and high specificity consistent with our findings .
low sensitivity and high specificity of self - reported stis symptoms were also reported in a chinese study by yin et al . . a study by mukenge - tshibaka et al .   among female sex workers in benin reported poor sensitivity of the stis symptoms .
studies in egypt and india [ 20 , 21 ] among women attending antenatal , family planning , and peripheral government clinics reported high sensitivity and low specificity of stis symptoms . in a study conducted in south africa among women attending std clinic , the sensitivity of stis symptoms varied greatly , ranging from 0% to 88% , in detecting different infections .
most studies on the association between stis symptoms and tests have been carried out in particular groups that are not representative of the overall population , such as std or antenatal clinic attendees , or sex workers [ 13 , 14 , 2022 ] . however , this study also had some limitations that may have influenced our findings .
first , only women who agreed to be tested for stis were included in the analysis , thereby ignoring the possible systematic differences between women who consented to be tested for stis and those who did not .
analysis of the complete cases can be biased if there was a systematic difference between cases with observed data and those with unobserved data .
for example , if women without or with fewer stis symptoms consented to be tested , this might have led to an underestimation of the true association between stis symptoms and tests .
second , some of the reported symptoms could have been caused by infections not measured in the study .
this might have also led to an underestimation of the true association between stis symptoms and tests .
third , the accuracy of the information given may be affected by the sensitive nature of information regarding symptoms of stis .
thus , the self - reported stis symptoms might have introduced social desirability and recall biases and were likely to be underreported .
the syndromic diagnosis of stis is often used in resource - poor settings where laboratory diagnosis is limited .
it is simple , cost effective , and capable of yielding rapid diagnosis for immediate treatment .","1. Introduction

"multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is known as an immune - mediated multifocal demyelinating disorder , which consists of components of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.1 it mostly occurs between the ages of 18 and 45 and has a substantial economic and social burden.1,2 the most common symptoms include spasticity , fatigue , balance problems , weakness , sensory disturbance , neurogenic bladder and bowel , cognition impairment , depression , pain , sexual disorder , emotional lability , blurred vision , and speech difficulties , in the order of their frequency of occurrence.1,2 compared with the 60%80% prevalence rate of spasticity due to the involvement of the pyramidal system , the involuntary movement disorders due to the lesion of the extrapyramidal system , such as myoclonus , spasmodic torticollis , paroxysmal dystonia , chorea , and ballism are very rare in patients with ms.2 in this case report , we describe a woman with relapsing - remitting ms , complicated with disabling paroxysmal dystonia , which responded very well to the 4-day administration of acetazolamide .
this 40-year - old woman had unremarkable past medical , family , and movement disorder history . in july 2005 , at age 34 , the patient initially presented with blurred vision , slurred speech , dysphagia , gradual onset of left hemiparesis , and ataxia .
surveys of infectious diseaes were all negative , including rapid plasma regain , venereal disease research laboratory , human immunodeficiency virus , and cultures .
the visual and somatosensory evoked potential indicated a right optic nerve lesion and right thoracolumbar myelopathy , respectively .
magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lesions at the cerebellum , brainstem , corpus callosum , as well as at the cervical and thoracic spinal cord .
the above findings in this patient met the criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis .
, she suffered from left optic neuritis , weakness in four extremities with spasticity , left paresthesia , neuropathic pain over her chest and back , and impaired proprioception .
after pulse steroid therapy , she was transferred to an acute rehabilitation ward for further training .
seven days after the onset of this ms relapse , involuntary movement developed in her left hand , which consisted of nonrhythmic posture of alternative flexion and extension of the fingers , abduction and adduction of the thumb , opponens of the thumb and little finger , flexion , and extension of the wrist .
the involuntary posture was usually aggravated by voluntary motion , attenuated at rest , and might subside temporarily while she slept .
it did not involve the proximal upper limbs , lower limbs , trunk , face , and neck .
there were no other neurological deficits , such as conscious disturbance , aura , and fatigue , indicating seizure disorders .
the paresis , spasticity , and neuropathic pain improved after the treatments with steroid , interferon beta-1b , baclofen , and imipramine ; however , the paroxysmal dystonia persisted despite the above treatments and occupational therapy .
, she accepted the prescription of oral acetazolamide ( 250 mg , three times a day ) 17 days after the onset of dystonia .
the patient felt progressive reduction in the amplitude of the disabling dystonic movement at first , then in the frequency of symptoms .
, she could continue the rehabilitative programs , and her hand functions were resumed to premorbid status .
there was no recurrence of dystonia in the following 17 months of follow - up .
paroxysmal dystonia is characterized by intermittent onset of sustained muscle contractions causing patterned twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures that might last seconds to hours.1,3 the idiopathic paroxysmal dystonia can be subdivided into kinesigenic , nonkinesigenic , hypnogenic , and exercise - induced forms.3 there were also some acquired paroxysmal dystonia , induced by the lesions involving the basal ganglion , extrapyramidal tract system , or thalamus.3,4 a widely accepted mechanism of dystonia is the increased motor cortical excitability by altered thalamic signaling.5 paroxysmal dystonia is rare in patients with ms .
the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia in patients with ms remains unknown.4 several mechanisms have been proposed , including axonal irritability secondary to the release of inflammatory mediators,4 a transversely spreading ephaptic activation of axons within the partially demyelinated lesion at any level in the motor fiber tracts , which was supported by a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.5 beyond the typical localizations , there were some sporadic case reports disclosing the demyelinated plaques in the cervical spinal cord , midbrain , medulla , internal capsule , cerebral peduncle , and even some cases without anatomic evidence in patients with ms.1,2,4,5 some investigators explained that the nature of lacking anatomic evidence for ms may be caused by secondary immune components , such as antibasal ganglia antibodies.6 the reported features of paroxysmal dystonia in ms were frequent attacks ( several times daily ) , short duration ( seconds to minutes mostly ) , and stereotyped posture of unilateral dystonia of the arm , leg , and sometimes the face and neck , which could not be attributed to an epileptic origin.2,5,712 there were some typical trigger factors , such as startle reaction , hyperventilation , stress , and fatigue.3 paroxysmal dystonia in some patients may subside within a few weeks spontaneously or after treatment.7 the most commonly prescribed medication was carbamazepine , but some patients did not have a satisfying response.2,4,12 a few cases reported trying to suppress symptoms with acetazolamide,911 phenytoin,12 adrenocorticotropic hormone,13 cannabis,14 and botulinum toxin.15 the therapeutic effects varied , and acetazolamide was considered to be the one with fewer side effects . in 1992 , sethi et al9 first adopted acetazolamide alone or in combination with carbamazepine in treating three patients with central demyelinating disease and paroxysmal dystonia .
nardocci et al10 noted that paroxysmal dystonia completely receded with a 4-day treatment of acetazolamide ( 250 mg , three times a day ) , and paroxysmal tremor was also attenuated by a 1-month treatment in a patient .
waubant et al11 reported that the symptoms stopped in a few hours post - acetazolamide treatment ( 250 mg , twice a day ) in their patients .
waubant et al prolonged the treatment for 1 month , and the symptoms did not recur .
in addition , acetazolamide was also proven to be effective in hereditary episodic ataxia type 2 , another kind of movement disorder.3,16 the exact mechanism of acetazolamide for paroxysmal dystonia in ms remains unclear .
acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , which fosters metabolic acidosis across the blood  brain barrier , thereby lowering the intracellular ph that reduces the potassium channels conductance and might alter the transmembranous potential and neuron excitability.1618 in addition , it could alternate the efflux of intracellular bicarbonate through -aminobutyric acid ( gaba)-activated channels.19 an animal study gave evidence that showed acetazolamide exerts antidystonic effects in the dt mutant hamster via inhibiting bicarbonate regeneration and reducing gaba - mediated excitation without affecting gaba - mediated inhibition.19 therefore , the neuronal hyperexcitability might be reduced , and the paroxysmal dystonia improved consequently . to the best of our knowledge ,
this type of ms with long - lasting paroxysmal dystonic posture of the hand is extremely rare in the previous literature .
the common trigger factors of dystonia , such as startle reaction , hyperventilation , stress , and fatigue , did not induce the patient s dystonia .
her dystonia did not respond to treatment with steroid , interferon , and baclofen . because of the good responses and few side effects of acetazolamide in previous case reports for typical short - lasting paroxysmal dystonia in ms,911 we treated our patient with this drug with a dosage of 250 mg , three times a day .
there was no recurrence of dystonia in the next 17 months of follow - up .
this dramatic effect of acetazolamide in our patient with ms and dystonia was an inspiring finding that would be of great interest for further study .
paroxysmal dystonia is rare in patients with multiple sclerosis , but it significantly endangers the independence of patients in basic daily living activities .
in addition to the policy of  wait and see ,  medications with few side effects , such as acetazolamide , might be one of the treatment alternatives .
we shared our clinical experience and advocate this effective and safe treatment option with acetazolamide for individuals with multiple sclerosis and dystonia .","Introduction

"cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy ( cadasil ) is a disease of the vascular smooth muscle typically caused by a mutation of the notch3 gene .
cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy often presents with a history of migraine with aura and eventual manifestations of dementia with unrelenting , repeated cerebral vascular insults , .
diagnoses have been made singularly or by a combination of genetic testing and skin biopsy .
only 610% of patients with cadasil have been reported to develop seizures , and status epilepticus ( se ) is exceedingly rare , , . here
, we describe a patient who presented three times in two years with se of an unknown cause , with eventual biopsy diagnosis of cadasil .
an 80-year - old woman presented to our hospital three times in two years with a decreased level of consciousness and subtle intermittent right - sided upper extremity and facial twitching .
her past medical history was only significant for well - controlled hypertension , with no history of seizures , migraine headaches , strokes , or overt dementia .
electroencephalography revealed recurrent focal seizures with left hemispheric onset and evolution , fulfilling the criteria for focal se each time ( fig .  1 ) .
brain mri repeatedly showed extensive abnormalities in the periventricular and deep white matter , subcortical white matter , and bilateral basal ganglia ( fig .  2 ) .
cerebrospinal fluid studies consistently revealed culture - negative , predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosis ( range : 27 to 92 ) . otherwise , detailed and repetitive investigations failed to reveal any clear etiology ( metabolic , infectious , inflammatory , paraneoplastic , etc . ) for the patient 's condition .
all three admissions required sedation with midazolam to control seizure activity in addition to high doses of multiple antiepileptic drugs .
the patient made a slow but full recovery after the first and second episodes , following five - week and four - week hospital stays , respectively .
the third episode occurred despite the regular intake of antiepileptic drugs ( valproate and levetiracetam ) , and the patient remained minimally responsive afterwards .
the patient did eventually require tracheostomy and peg tube placement and was discharged to a nursing home .
months after discharge , she is still in a nursing home with unimproved mental status . on the third admission ,
skin biopsy was obtained and returned positive ; electron microscopic images showed gaps and discontinuities in the perivascular smooth muscle layer with numerous deposits of granular osmiophilic material ( fig .  3 ) .
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of cadasil presenting as nonconvulsive se , without the other typical manifestations .
seizures are seen in a small percentage of patients with cadasil , but they often follow a stroke and are not typically the first manifestation of the disease , .
status epilepticus is also very rare in this disease ; we found only one published case report of eeg - proven nonconvulsive se in a patient with established diagnosis of cadasil .
described six patients with cadasil with a reversible acute encephalopathy ; four of them had seizures during their hospitalization .
however , their eeg data did not show ictal seizure activity , although the recordings were apparently brief and not continuous .
it is possible that the diagnosis of nonconvulsive se was missed in at least some of these cases , suggesting that this complication of cadasil is underdiagnosed .
manifestations of cadasil usually start in early or mid - adulthood , with gradual accumulation of deficits .
however , the phenotypic and prognostic variability has already been emphasized with 14% of biopsy - proven patients over 60  years of age having no disability at all .
the consistent csf pleocytosis in this case is unusual for cadasil , but the co - occurrence of se may be a confounding factor .
this case illustrates the potential for nonconvulsive se to be the sole manifestation of cadasil . with the appropriate brain mri findings
, cadasil should be added to the list of rare causes of se , regardless of a subject 's advanced age .","Introduction

"a 27-year - old woman presented with acute onset of severe diffuse headache for one day and slurred speech for 4 hours .
she had not previously been on contraceptive pills , and did not have any personal or family history of venous thrombosis , autoimmune disease , or hematologic disease .
laboratory examination showed a normal complete blood count and normal renal , hepatic , and coagulation profiles .
urgent brain ct revealed temporal hemorrhage surrounded by an extensive hypodense area ( figure 1 ) .
an mri using a 3.0 t scanner revealed a hyperintense lesion surrounded by a large hypointense area on t1-weighted images ( figure 2a ) , and a hypointense lesion surrounded by a large hyperintense area on t2-weighted and fluid - attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) images ( figures 2b & 2c ) .
after administration of gadopentetic acid dimeglumine salt , no obvious contrast enhancement was seen on t1-weighted images .
magnetic resonance venography ( mrv ) showed that the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses were completely occluded ( figure 2d ) .
a brain digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) confirmed thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses with engorgement of the superficial veins in the left hemisphere ( figure 3 ) , but was negative for vascular malformations such as aneurysm , arteriovenous malformation ( avm ) , and dural arteriovenous fistula .
transvaginal sonography revealed an early intrauterine pregnancy , the gestational sac was 555 mm in size , and the fetal germ , or fetal heart could not be detected .
a cvst with cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed according to clinical data . to control intracranial hypertension , treatment with mannitol
was commenced immediately , and dose - adjusted low - molecular - weight heparin ( 9600 units / day for 10 days ) was started 3 days after the onset of cvst to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time between 1.5 and 2.0 times of control value .
when a repeat ct showed that the cerebral hemorrhage had regressed , heparin was substituted with oral warfarin .
two months later , mrv showed recanalization of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses ( figure 4 ) , and remained asymptomatic in the following years .
non - contrast axial scan reveals temporal hemorrhage surrounded by a large hypodense area . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and magnetic resonance venography ( mrv ) upon admission showing :
a ) the lesion appears hyperintense surrounded by a large hypointense area on t1-weighted mri , b ) hypointense surrounded by a large hyperintense area on t2-weighted mri , c ) fluid - attenuated inversion recovery mri .
d ) mrv shows complete occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses . digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) upon admission .
anteroposterior view reveals complete thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as engorgement of the superficial veins in left hemisphere .
a cvst is an uncommon but serious neurological emergency , the overall death , and dependency rate are approximately 10 - 15%.4 pregnancy and puerperium induces changes in the coagulation system , increasing the risk of cvst .
the period of greatest risk for cvst includes the third trimester of pregnancy , and the first 4 postpartum weeks.5 only a few cases of cvst in early pregnancy have been reported.3,5,6 - 8 a cvst with cerebral hemorrhage in early pregnancy is extremely rare , lavin et al3 reported the first case of cvst with cerebral hemorrhage at 8 weeks of pregnancy , the patient died because of massive cerebral venous infarction with edema.3 the clinical manifestations of cvst are non - specific .
the most frequent symptoms are headache , seizures , neurological deficit , and decreased level of consciousness.9 signs of cerebral hernia can appear in patients with mass effects , such as edema , infarction , and hemorrhage .
because of the wide spectrum of symptoms and signs of cvst , it can be difficult to arrive at the correct diagnosis based on clinical assessment alone .
hemorrhage , edema , and infarction can be detected on ct , a hyperdense lesion can be found occasionally in the venous sinus indicating thrombosis .
an mri can differentiate cvst from tumor apoplexy , and mrv can reveal sinus occlusion .
cerebral angiography is invasive and involves radiation ; however , this method allows the detection of sinus thrombosis .
other vascular abnormalities such as aneurysm , arteriovenous fistula , and avm can also be excluded by dsa .
an mri and mrv are non - invasive and do not involve radiation , we therefore , consider that the combination of mri and mrv is the best choice for the investigation of suspected cvst in pregnant women .
there have been no large trials of anticoagulation in pregnancy , and recommendations are based on case series and the opinions of experts .
nonetheless , anticoagulation is believed to be beneficial for patients with cvst and hemorrhagic complications . among 29 patients with intracranial hemorrhage and cvst treated with low - molecular - weight heparin ( 180 anti - factor xa units / kg / day for 3 weeks ) , de bruijn et al10 reported 6 deaths , none of which were attributable to fresh or exacerbated cerebral hemorrhage .
although the best time to start anticoagulation treatment is not known , repeating ct or mri to confirm that the intracranial hemorrhage is regressing or at least not progressing is advisable before starting anticoagulation .
the use of local thrombolysis for cvst was first reported by weatherby8 in 2003 , who achieved a successful outcome in a patient who developed cvst in early pregnancy .
the use of endovascular treatment for cvst should be considered in patients who are resistant to anticoagulation therapy , have worsening symptoms , do not have intracranial hemorrhage , and are not at risk for impending herniation.11 decompressive hemicraniectomy could be life - saving and even lead to an excellent outcome in cvst patients with impending transtentorial herniation because of large hemorrhagic venous infarcts.12 in patients with cvst in early pregnancy , early management of the embryo to eliminate the triggered spontaneous coagulation might also contribute toward recovery.5 in conclusion , cvst with cerebral hemorrhage can occur in early pregnancy .
an mri combined with mrv may be the best choice for the investigation of a suspected cvst in a pregnant woman .
anticoagulation therapy may be beneficial in curing cvst , even in pregnant patients with intracranial hemorrhage . in our patient , anticoagulation was successful when administered 3 days after the onset of the disease .

"the ccf is an abnormal arteriovenous connection between the carotid artery and the venous cavernous sinus .
ccfs are classified as direct or indirect , traumatic or spontaneous , and high or slow flow based on arterial supplies , etiology , and shunt flow rate , respectively .
. indirect ccfs ( dural ccf ) usually occur in postmenopausal , hypertensive women arising from dural branches of either internal carotid artery ( ica ) ( type b ) or external carotid artery ( eca ) ( type c ) or both ( mixed or type d ) .
ccfs drain toward anterior via ophthalmic veins , inferior via pterygoid plexus and inferior petrosal sinus ( ips ) , contralateral via intercavernous connections , posterior via deep venous system , superior petrosal sinus ( sps ) , and cerebellar veins , and superior via superficial middle cerebral vein ( smcv ) .
mostly patients present with orbital symptoms secondary to anterior drainage but clinical presentation may change according to venous drainage pattern .
less commonly , headache , altered mental status , and other neurological deficits such as ischemia or infarction secondary to venous hypertension or steal phenomena may occur [ 27 ] .
urgent treatment is usually needed for direct and high flow fistulas in which endovascular embolization is mostly applied .
indirect , slow flow ccfs usually close spontaneously without treatment [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 ] . in this study , we evaluated their venous drainage patterns by dsa and categorized their drainage patterns according to their types and etiology .
dsa views of 13 ccfs from 10 subjects were taken into consideration for categorization of venous drainage pathways .
ages of subjects were ranging from 34 to 72 and of them 5 were men and 5 were women . two neuroradiologist ( ayse aralasmak and timur sindel ) evaluated the dsa views with a consensus reached in all . diagnosis of ccfs
was first made by noninvasive imaging techniques such as mri , mr angiography ( mra ) , ct , ct angiograpy ( cta ) , or doppler ultrasonography ( usg ) .
findings suggestive of ccfs on noninvasive diagnostic techniques were orbital congestion , exophthalmus , dilation of sov , asymmetric enhancement of the cavernous sinus and surrounding venous system , and arterialization of the surrounding venous structures appearing as flow void on mri or flow related signal on mra or early filling on cta or reverse and pulsatile flow within the sov on doppler usg ( figure 1 ) . among 13 ccfs ,
direct or indirect , high or slow flow , and posttraumatic or spontaneous ones were present .
examples of ccf types with various drainage patterns were given at figures 2 , 3 , and 4 .
bilaterality and mixed types were observed in indirect spontaneous ccfs . in both direct and indirect ccfs ,
posterior and superior drainages were noted only in high flow and long standing direct fistulas . in spontaneous indirect ccfs ,
contralateral drainage is not observed in all ccfs . in one of our cases with indirect - type b ccf ,
main drainage was contralateral toward the opposite superior ophthalmic vein and minor drainage was inferior via ips on the same side .
traumatic ccfs are usually high flow and direct type fistulas with sudden onset of symptoms .
they predominantly occur in young men because of higher incidence of trauma in this population .
underlying mechanisms are direct injury from the skull base fracture or injury from torsion or stretching of the carotid siphon upon impact and impingement of the vessel on bony prominences .
direct ccfs following surgical procedures such as endoscopic nasal surgery and vascular neurosurgery or spontaneously from aneurysm rupture have also been reported .
spontaneous ccfs occur secondary to hypertension , atherosclerosis , neurofibromatosis , and collagen vascular disorders .
they are usually slow flow indirect type fistulas with insidious onset , commonly seen in elderly , postmenopausal , and hypertensive women with another peak of incidence during pregnancy [ 1 , 2 , 79 ] .
bilateral ccf cases comprise % 1215 of all and are usually indirect in variety . in our small study group , subjects with direct high flow ccfs were all men with a previous history of trauma and subjects with indirect ccfs were mostly elderly women usually with no known disease except one with a history of hypertension .
our findings so far are in accordance with the literature . in our study group , drainage pathways were toward anterior via ophthalmic veins , toward inferior via pterygoid plexus and ips , toward contralateral via intercavernous connections , toward posterior via deep venous system ( basal vein of rosenthal ( bvr ) ) , sps , and cerebellar veins , and toward superior via smcv . in both direct and indirect ccfs ,
however , posterior and superior drainages were noted only in long standing high flow direct ccfs . in spontaneous indirect ccfs
contralateral drainage was not observed in all ccfs suggesting the possibility of compartmentalization within the cavernous sinuses .
we thought that all compartments were not connected to each other ( compartmentalization ) since in cases of unilateral ccf , contralateral drainage was not observed in all . in ccf , venous drainage patterns and
posterior and inferior drainage may induce cranial nerve palsies , probably due to neural compression by an expanding cavernous sinus or ips , or venous congestive changes in the posterior fossa and brain stem [ 2 , 57 , 10 ] .
high flow shunt may cause ischemia or arterial infarct due to steal phenomena [ 3 , 57 ] .
spontaneous ccfs may present with atypical clinical findings , such as ocular signs contralateral to the fistula side or cranial nerve palsy only .
posterior and superior drainages may have significant results such as seizure , congestion or venous infarctions in the cerebrum , cerebellum , deep brain structures and brain stem [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] .
bvr , a part of deep venous and posterior drainage pathway , may drain into the galenic vein , cavernous sinus , and sphenoparietal sinus ( sps ) via the peduncular and lateral mesencephalic veins and into transverse sinus or straight sinus via the tentorial veins .
lateral mesencephalic vein , a draining vein of brain stem , was noted in the direct ccf ( figure 2 ) , connecting the bvr to sps .
the smcv is a cortical vein connecting to the sphenoparietal or cavernous sinus ( 60% ) , or to the pterygoid plexus ( 14% ) in normal population .
it may also drain into transverse sinus through the vein of labbe or superior sagittal sinus through the vein of trolard .
the smcv was noted in our two subjects with long standing high flow direct ccfs draining into the superior sagittal sinus via trolard vein ( figure 2 ) .
we did not find any superior or posterior drainage in our cases with indirect ccfs , but suh et al . observed superior drainage in 21% , posterior drainage in 15% , and both posterior and superior drainage in 5% of total 58 cases ( 50 females , 8 males ) with indirect ccfs . in the larger series of indirect ccfs , kirsch et al . reported superior and deep venous drainage in 34% , anterior drainage via the sov in 88% , inferior drainage via the ips in 42% , and contralateral drainage via intercavernous connections in 23% of total 141 cases ( 121 females , 20 males )
absence of posterior and superior drainage within our cases of indirect fistula may be the result of the limited patient population or related to time onset of fistulization since posterior and superior drainages were noted only in high flow direct ccfs existing for a long time . in diagnosis and classification of ccfs , dsa is still a gold standard although findings from noninvasive imaging techniques are helpful for diagnosing .
these are uni- or bilateral exopthalmus , orbital congestion , dilation of sov , arterialization of the surrounding venous structures appearing as flow void on mri or flow related signal on mra or early filling on cta or reverse flow or arterialized flow within the sov on doppler ultrasonography , and asymmetric enhancement of cavernous sinuses and surrounding venous system [ 15 , 16 ] ( figure 1 ) .
flow void appearance on t2 weighted images depends on the flow rate within the cavernous sinus and veins .
evaluation of the drainage patterns of ccfs may help planning the endovascular treatment . in direct ccfs , either transarterial or transvenous embolization of the fistula site is usually performed .
indirect dural ccfs have a relatively high incidence of spontaneous resolution ( 1073% ) ; therefore , invasive diagnostic measures and treatment might not be necessary but only manual ica compression [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 ] . among endovascular treatment of direct ccfs and symptomatic indirect ccfs , transarterial embolization is a more common approach .
transvenous embolization is employed in the presence of multiple arterial feeders and inability to occlude indirect ccfs by the arterial route .
if the sinus is impassable , alternative routes are the pterygoid venous plexus , superior petrosal sinus , facial vein , or ophthalmic veins .
although noninvasive radiologic techniques can aid diagnosis of the ccfs , dsa is still a gold standard for diagnosis and valuable for categorization of ccfs and verification of their drainage patterns .
drainage pathways may affect the clinic presentation and change treatment approach . in our small study group of ccf ,
contrary to the literature , posterior and superior drainages were noted only in long standing high flow direct ccfs .
contralateral drainage was not observed in all , supporting the possibility of compartmentalization within the cavernous sinuses .","1. Introduction

"a 65-year - old female visited wonkwang dental university hospital for the removal of a bony dysplastic lesion in the left maxilla .
this lesion has been regularly examined in follow - up for the last 14 years . on clinical examination ,
, she visited our dental hospital for treatment of a periodontal condition on the entire dentition .
she had already recognized bony swelling on the left maxilla decades ago , but recalled no experience of pain or fever .
her medical history did not contain anything of significance . computed tomography in 2002 showed a ground - glass appearance of the left maxilla , which was compatible with fd ( fig .
2 ) . bucco - lingual cortical expansion , but no cortical destruction , was observed .
she refused surgical treatment due to a fear of surgery and felt no need for it , since there was no pain and the lesion was not increasing in size .
3 ) showed a diffuse , widespread , radiopaque lesion in the left maxilla and maxillary sinus .
a periapical view in 2007 showed a ground - glass appearance and indistinct anterior border of the lesion .
4 ) . in 2008 , we performed bone scintigraphy using tc - methylene diphosphonate ( tc - mdp ) for detecting the distribution of the lesion .
a whole - body bone scan showed intense uptake of radioisotope in the left maxilla ( fig .
figure 5b shows mild uptake of radioisotope in the vascular and blood pool phase , and intense uptake in the delayed bone scan .
blood pool images were acquired immediately after the flow portion of the study and completed within 10 minutes of tracer injection , for approximately 3.5 minutes / image .
routine delayed images are usually obtained 2 - 5 hours after injection . the panoramic view ( fig .
6a , 2016 ) showed a similar image of the lesion , compared with older images ( fig . 6b , 2012 ;
7a and b ) in 2016 showed a similar image and no change in size when compared with older images ( figs .
2 ) . a ground - glass appearance , expanded cortex , no tooth displacement , and slight involvement of the maxillary sinus were common findings .
excision of the fd was carried out and a surgical specimen was sent for histopathological examination .
microscopic examination of the excised specimen showed irregularly shaped woven bone with peritrabecular clefting within a cellular fibrous stroma .
it has been reported that fd represents approximately 5% to 7% of all benign bone tumors.12 occurrences of fd present in 3 forms that are monostotic ( including craniofacial ) , polyostotic , and polyostotic with endocrinopathies .
the monostotic form accounts for 80% to 85% of cases with fd,7 and is not a precursor of the polyostotic form.13 the occurrence of fd is found predominantly in children and young adults , with 75% of patients presenting before the age of 30.1415 cases in female patients have been observed more frequently in their later decades.16 monostotic fd of the jaws more commonly involves the maxilla than the mandible,1617 but another study has reported that the mandible was more frequently involved.8 due to the gradual and painless nature of fd , the clinical findings are usually asymptomatic .
if the fd extends into sphenoid , orbital , or frontal bones , complications may include proptosis , visual disturbances , and hearing loss.18 in this case , the patient presented with monostotic fd that was localized to the left side of the maxilla , which caused alveolar bone expansion and facial asymmetry .
the natural progression of fd includes 2 phases : an active phase , which persists until puberty , and a subsequent phase.1920 many reports have shown that fd progresses slowly or ceases after bone maturation .
however , the range in the literature is wide - in some cases it does not progress after puberty,921 while in other cases it continues to progress in old age.2223 polyostotic fd is more likely to continue to progress even after puberty.12 the present report is focused on fd manifesting in an elderly female patient , which is rare .
this case might have been a slow growing lesion in the beginning , which then entered into a quiescent stage in adulthood .
we postulated that the patient might not have noticed the severity of this lesion until middle age .
remodeling of bone to normal lamellar type does not happen in the dysplastic bone of fd .
thus , this bone is likely to be vulnerable to stimulation , which may reactivate it.7 some cases of reactivation in later stages of life have also been reported.1011 the possible mechanisms of reactivation are trauma , hormonal changes , trauma - included accident , surgery , or tooth extraction.24 another study of fd that activated or reactivated in pregnant women proposed that female sex hormones are important in the high recurrence rate of fd of the jaws for female patients.725 some previous studies have reported that there is a very small risk for malignant transformation.26 the risk for malignant transformation is estimated at less than 1% in the monostotic form and at maximally 4% to 6.7% in the polyostotic form;2728 this is less prevalent in patients who have not undergone radiation therapy.28 the current gold standard for the diagnosis of fd is a histologically proven fibro - osseous lesion with poorly defined margins , and definite diagnosis relies on radiographic findings.7 the abnormal trabeculae are usually shorter , thinner , irregularly shaped , and more numerous than normal trabeculae .
these abnormal trabeculae and the homogenous radiodensity account for the  ground - glass  appearance in fd.32930 fd affecting the maxilla almost always involves the antrum , either by obliterating it or by gross displacement of its borders.8 the fd extension in this case was directed horizontally , but also slightly vertically . in this growth direction the floor of the left maxillary sinus appeared slightly occupied .
the loss of lamina dura was unique to fd and could be used as another diagnostic feature for fd.31 bone scintigraphy , using tc - mdp is exquisitely sensitive for detecting fd lesions.32 it is a useful imaging modality for detecting the distribution of lesions , and scintigraphy has been evaluated for discriminating between monostotic and polyostotic disease , ruling out metastasis of secondary sarcoma , and recurrence after therapy.33 monostotic fd , especially in the bones of the skull , generally appears as an area of markedly increased uptake reflecting hyperemia as well as osteoid matrix , with a particularly intense homogenous uptake pattern in the delayed phase.34 the bone scintigraphy in this study showed intense uptake of delayed bone phase although perfusion and blood pool phases showed mild uptake .
we think intense uptake of delayed bone phase is due to the increased surface area of fibrous - degenerative bone , rather than the increased vascularity and osteoblast activity of the lesion .
our case showed fd in the left maxilla of a more than 14-year duration with almost the same size .
this report emphasizes a case of a hamartomatous nature , involving the quiescent stage of fd in an elderly patient .
our evaluation is that this case ceased to grow in early adulthood , when skeletal maturity had been reached .
a literature review on the disease activity of fd suggests that reactivation of fd could be possible due to many factors , but most cases remain in the quiescent stage , and malignant transformation is very rare in monostotic fd .","Case Report

"the traditional role of the agriculture and food system was fairly simple : supply food ( and other commodity outputs like fiber ) .
but the production and distribution of food also create by - products that are not traded on markets and many of them have characteristics of public goods and externalities ; that is , these are outputs that either create benefits for or impose costs on society that are not reflected in market prices .
some of those outputs were discussed at the conference food systems and public health : linkages to achieve healthier diets and healthier communities , including landscape preservation , rural development , air and water pollution , climate change , biodiversity , antibiotic resistance , and population health ( including obesity ) .
most conference presentations focused on only one of these nonmarket outputs and this commentary , which primarily deals with obesity and affordability , is no exception .
nevertheless , it is useful to first remember that there exists a general framework to integrate those diverse issues , known as multifunctionality .
the term is not well known in public health but has a history in international trade policy .
i will briefly discuss multifunctionality in the next session because it provides a systems approach to coherently view the broad range of conference topics .
the remainder of the article focuses on a much narrower issue ; namely , obesity and affordability .
these are obviously issues central to the goal of the journal but were treated somewhat secondarily at the conference .
obesity is arguably the most prominent public health issue at the moment and there is no question that it is related to the food system .
because of obesity 's saliency , many groups try to link their goals to obesity .
potentially relevant issues are poverty , affordability , food insecurity , fruit and vegetable production , and local production .
many of those were discussed at the conference and fit into the framework of multifunctionality , but the relationship to obesity is not always clear .
there is no shortage of plausible arguments , although their applicability is often narrower than proponents assume .
intriguing hypotheses for some relationships have been proposed , but without taking a closer look at the data , it is difficult to assess their relevance . though this commentary can not be a comprehensive review of the evidence , i will comment on what empirical evidence suggests for those questions : how is obesity changing in the united states ( and across subpopulations ) ? how does that relate to food prices , income , and affordability ? is fruit / vegetable consumption declining ? could more fruit / vegetables or local production make a noticeable dent into obesity trends ?
multifunctionality refers to the linkage between commodity and noncommodity output production in agriculture or , more broadly , food systems .
a good review of multifunctionality in the context of world trade was published by the us department of agriculture ( usda ) .
the concept of multifunctionality provides a good first step of addressing many of the topics from the conference from a systems perspective . of course , the basic idea that health , sustainability , and food production should be considered jointly is not novel and has appeared over time in a variety of fields ( see , for example , hamm in a previous volume of this journal ) .
the food systems and public health conference mainly discussed negative externalities , including greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and food distribution , pesticide runoff , water pollution from cafos , excess fertilizer use , and antibiotic resistance .
table 1 shows some outcomes that have been discussed within the context of multifunctionality of food systems .
it categorizes outcomes into 4 broader groups ( positive environmental outcomes , negative environmental outcomes , health outcomes , and social outcomes ) and gives a few examples . in france , for example
, high value is placed on the  scenic landscape  and  cultural heritage  arguments .
non - market products of a multifunctional food system in general , the linkage between food production / distribution and any of those outcomes is not fixed but influenced by policy and technological change .
in fact , even the most basic economic issue , namely , whether commodity production and rural development are jointly created , remains unclear .
this is particularly surprising because one of the traditional roles of agricultural subsidies has been to promote rural development .
the evidence is to which extent price guarantees and incentives to increase production have benefited rural communities is mixed .
the basic idea of multifunctionality appears uncontroversial , but what made it controversial in international trade was that countries used claims of positive environmental externalities to circumvent international trade agreements and maintain traditional production subsidies or government supported prices .
multifunctionality provides an excellent and widely understood framework , but it needs to be filled with more empirical data .
a population 's health and nutrition outcomes rank among the most important outcomes of multifunctional local , national , and international food systems .
food systems have been extraordinarily successful in developed countries of assuring a plentiful food supply , a dramatic change over the past 100 years .
the major issue in developed and medium - income countries ( like brazil ) now is obesity , no longer a shortage of food , which was experienced by a large fraction of the population even in countries like the united states or in western europe less than 100 years ago .
worldwide , of course , hunger remains very real , and undernourishment may currently affect a billion people , primarily in sub - saharan africa and south asia .
obesity has traditionally been the privilege of the wealthy  and it still is in many countries .
so a somewhat surprising new development is the concern that low income or high food prices or limited access to food outlets (  food deserts  ) cause obesity .
he argues that the lowest - cost options to obtain a given amount of energy from food is through an energy - dense diet composed of refined grains , added sugars , and fats .
lower income people tend to spend less on food overall and specifically less on lower energy - dense ( but more costly ) foods like fruits and vegetables .
a related argument was in a clinical case report by bill dietz of an obese 7-year - old girl .
dietz argued that the increased fat content of food eaten during times when the family had insufficient income to buy a healthy diet was the primary reason but offered as an alternative hypothesis that obesity is an adaptive response to episodic food insufficiency .
there are other similarly plausible hypotheses that give virtually the opposite predictions and this is why we need to look closely at the data .
the basic economic argument is that people consume more when they either get richer or prices fall .
moreover , the  full  price is not just money but also the time and effort it takes to obtain it .
the full price of a home - prepared meal includes not just ingredients but travel to the store , time preparing the food , time cleaning up .
as food becomes relatively cheaper and people become wealthier ( both occurred in the past 50 years ) , the simple economic theory predicts that obesity rates should increase .
proponents of this theory would agree with drewnowski 's statement that  obesity in america is , to a large extent , an economic issueeven if they reach opposite conclusions about the effects .
there are countless other theories about obesity , so there is no shortage of theories .
even contradictory hypotheses can be correct if they apply to different situations  just as public health and clinical perspectives differ .
eventually , it is an empirical question what the primary effects are and whether there are special situations where other considerations apply . here , the relevant questions are how is obesity changing in the united states ( and across subpopulations ) ?
could more fruit / vegetables or local production make a noticeable dent into obesity trends ?
price and income data may be important because they shed light on underlying economic trends . in the past 50 years
, food prices have declined relative to prices of all other goods ( about 10%15% ) and real income has increased substantially .
americans spend much less of their disposable income on food than ever  but this smaller share buys a much larger amount of calories ( figure 1 ) .
almost all the decline came from food at home , the share of disposable income for food away from home increased a little bit but stayed relatively constant as shown in figure 1 . that , of course , means that americans spent a lot more in absolute terms on food away from home and also that an increasing share of total food expenditures was for food away from home . in 1970
, americans spent one third of their food dollars on food away from home ( ie , dollars for food away from home divided by all food expenditures ) , which grew to 39% in 1980 , 45% in 1990 , and 47% in 2001 .
again , that can be interpreted as a price effect : the full price to obtain food has declined even more than price statistics indicate because of greater convenience , variety , and ubiquitous availability of food .
technological change has created an environment were a multitude of ready - to - eat foods are available anywhere at any time .
the ubiquitous availability of foods can be overwhelming and artificially stimulate hunger and cravings for food , regardless of physiological needs , eventually resulting in what former food and drug administration ( fda ) chief david kessler calls  conditioned hypereating .  the changes in our environment ( not only for food but also for physical activity ) have their counterparts in weight trends .
figure 2 shows the average body mass index ( bmi ) , stratified by educational achievement .
the most striking effect is the similarity in weight gain over time across groups , very consistent with an environmental change that affects everybody similarly .
this parallel trend is not limited to educational subgroups and stratifying by other characteristics , including by income , shows similar parallel increases .
the second noticeable feature of figure 2 is that at every point in time , there is a pronounced difference in mean bmi by educational achievement , with higher weight among less educated groups .
that could provide some evidence for the poverty  obesity link , although education is not income and the continuous educational gradient is not explained by a poverty affect .
unfortunately , it is difficult to draw similar time series for income because of the way data have been collected .
but we can split the lowest and the highest income groups for two ( or more ) time points ( figure 3 ) .
there is indeed a big difference for women in the expected direction but not for men . if low income were the primary cause of obesity , why would this theory only apply to half the population ?
even for women , the interpretation of the causal effect is questionable : there is an unambiguous association and the causal direction may be in the opposite direction .
longitudinal data show that women who are obese as adolescents or young adults are more likely to end in families with lower income and even in poverty , regardless of baseline status ; however , this is not the case for men .
the marriage market remains a very important determinant for a woman 's socioeconomic status , even though increased labor market participation rates have substantially reduced its role compared to the past .
the biggest and most striking phenomenon is that the large average weight gains over time are fairly similar in all population .
a second - order effect is the existence of consistent differences at every point in time between subpopulations .
those differences have been fairly stable in the last 20 years ( which at least for income groups must be a reversal from 100 years ago ) .
changes in the differences between groups over time are minor in comparison , although they also exist .
so a number of theories can be consistent with some parts of the data  for example , the association between poverty and obesity among women  but may be limited in their generalizability to time trends or the general population .
weight gain is both about energy intake and energy expenditure and there have been changes in physical activity patterns , but those changes are more subtle than changes in dietary patterns and do not fit weight trends very well . on the other hand , there were big changes in eating patterns , including the shift toward eating out , increasing serving sizes , and much more snacking between meal times .
the general tenor in public debates is that diet quality has deteriorated by a shift toward 
junk food ,  that cross - sectional disparities in obesity rates are caused by lack of access to 
the implication , which seemed to be believed by many conference participants , would be that increased fruit / vegetable supply ( partly through more local production ) can be an important tool in containing obesity , adding an additional multifunctional benefit to fruit / vegetable production .
there are some arguments in favor of this idea : americans eat less fruits and vegetables than recommended by dietary guidelines ; current production would be insufficient to achieve guideline consumption ; individuals who eat more fruits / vegetables tend to be thinner .
economic trends may also shift incentives in a direction that is not conducive to healthier eating patterns .
relative to the consumer price index , sugar , sweets , fats , and oils all became cheaper ; soft drinks were among the items that became ( relatively ) the cheapest . on the other hand , the price index for fresh fruit and vegetables averaged across a year appeared to increase faster , but this could be an artifact of increased availability out of season .
prices are higher out of season , but in earlier years there were no comparison prices because those foods were just not available at all . however
, preventing obesity is not about eating more food , regardless of how local or organic or fresh , but about eating less .
figure 4 shows the increase in availability for fresh produce , about 75 pounds per capita per year over the last 30 years .
total produce ( which includes frozen , canned , other uses ) has increased similarly . moreover , the biggest increases are in the most recommended groups .
availability of dark green vegetables has gone up from 4 pounds per capita per year in 1970 to 29 pounds in 2007 ; deep yellow from 15 pounds in 1970 to 22 pounds in 2007 . for specific examples ,
bell peppers increased from 2 to 7 pounds and broccoli from 1.5 to 8.7 pounds .
in contrast , relatively little changed for starchy vegetables , like potatoes ( which , of course , in absolute magnitudes account for much more ) . fresh fruit and vegetables per capita availability
there are other ways to calculate production and disappearance data , but essentially they all show the same qualitative picture ; namely , that fruit and vegetable consumptions increased . the lowest numbers i could find were for loss - adjusted food availability .
the usda estimated that , in 1995 , the fresh fruit and vegetable category had the greatest food losses at 19.6% and the added fats and oils category had losses amounting to 7.1% .
using the loss - adjusted categories , fruit consumption per capita increased by 15% and vegetable consumption by 23% from 1970 to 2007 but apparently without preventing obesity .
the 2005 us dietary guidelines introduced the concept of  discretionary calories  to address two dietary goals simultaneously : energy balance and the need for essential nutrients . the amount of calories for each goal differs and depends upon age , physical activity levels , and diet quality .
the amount of discretionary calories is what is left over once individuals have satisfied essential nutrients through intake of recommended food items and can range from 130 calories for older sedentary women to over 500 calories for very physically active individuals . people who exceed their discretionary calories either have an energy imbalance or are at risk for malnutrition  or both .
discretionary calories should not be understood as the amount of junk food that can be consumed .
the relationship between reduction in cancer risk and intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is continuous , so discretionary calories could also be used to increase fruit / vegetable consumption beyond guideline recommendations .
but if candy and sodas become part of the diet , better to keep those calories under the threshold amount for discretionary calories . however , that is not what we are likely to find anywhere . instead , wherever we collected data , whether in louisiana , poorer neighborhoods in los angeles , or minority communities in northern california , the average number of excess calories from just a few selected snack items and soft drinks were beyond total discretionary calories and the discrepancy to guidelines was larger than for fruits / vegetables .
using 5-a - day as a standard because it has been the most widely promoted target ( although now there are higher goals ) , the shortfall in fruits / vegetables was 10% to 20% , but excess discretionary calories were 60% to 120% ( in both cases , louisiana had the highest discrepancies ) .
most importantly , calories from snacks and sugar - sweetened beverages are higher than recommended discretionary calories in every population subgroup , even among people who say that they try to eat less to lose / maintain weight .
discretionary calories are more important predictors of bmi than fruit and vegetable consumption or physical activity levels at the population level . increased physical activity reduced excess discretionary calories , although not to zero ; increased fruit / vegetable consumption slightly reduced snack calories but by less than the additional calories that come with the fruit ( at least cross - sectionally , we see little evidence for substitution ) .
a usda study estimated annual retail price per pound and per serving for 69 forms of fruits and 85 forms of vegetables across the united states and more than half were estimated to cost 25 cents or less per serving . at that time
, consumers could have even met a 7-a - day goal ( 3 servings of fruits and 4 servings of vegetables daily ) for 64 cents , which is even affordable to low - income households , representing 16% of their daily food expenditures .
reducing prices may have little effect on behavior of low - income groups because they do not appear to be very price sensitive , meaning that even a large subsidy would result only in a very small increase in consumption . on the other hand , there are geographic price variations and higher produce prices have been linked to larger weight gain among children .
the causal link is unclear , and the result could very well be caused by other confounding factors , although an intriguing hypothesis is that the effect may be through school food purchasing decisions .
school food services are highly responsive to price variations given the large amount of purchases and budget constraints .
usda reimbursements for school meals are identical across the united states , so school food services facing higher costs will need to economize somewhere . of course , this is exactly where linkages to local production could have a particularly high impact and several pilot programs have explored this .
the conference discussed public goods and externalities created as byproducts of the food system , including local development , air and water pollution , climate change , antibiotic resistance , and other public health issues .
multifunctionality is a framework that integrates these diverse issues and may help to provide a common framework to the diverse issues discussed at the conference . in public health , the overriding policy concern these days is obesity .
though there are many attempts to link obesity with other goals ( even organic production has been mentioned ) , i do not believe that there are many connections .
framing obesity as an issue of poverty or food insecurity is not very well supported by data at the population level .
weight has increased similarly in all population groups and lower income men are not more likely to be overweight than higher income men . with 1 billion people worldwide who face hunger as a real threat and are truly food insecure ( and not obese ) , trying to make obesity a food insecurity story trivializes a major problem .
more variety means more eating , not less ; there is limited evidence that people substitute ( outside clinical settings ) ; and as far as obesity is concerned , juice is not different from soda .
a 2009 report by the institute of medicine on food deserts also points to total consumption and that 
greater fruit and vegetable consumption alone will not reduce weight without the qualification to moderate energy intake .
 unaffordability of produce may not be the problem as far as obesity is concerned  it is excess availability and affordability of other things . in public health campaigns against tobacco , alcohol , and illicit drugs ,
in contrast , campaigns addressing obesity have shied away from that and instead have encouraged people to consume more fruits and vegetable and low - fat foods . over the past few decades it appears that americans have taken this advice and the usda food disappearance data show increased fruit and vegetable consumption .
many policy interventions are focusing on  positive  messages , such as increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and increasing physical activity .
but an emphasis on reducing discretionary calorie consumption , particularly sugar - sweetened sodas and salted snacks , may be a promising lever to reduce overweight and obesity and should receive more attention .
though increasing fruit and vegetable consumption may be a laudable goal for other health reasons , it is unlikely to be an effective tool for obesity prevention .","INTRODUCTION

"a polarized distribution of maternally expressed proteins determines the spatial axes of the caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila embryos .
correct deployment of these proteins can entail asymmetric localization of their mrnas , spatially restricted translational control , spatially restricted control of mrna stability , or direct protein targeting .
recent advances in this area indicate that control of mrna stability via poly(a ) tail length is a key target for regulatory pathways essential to embryonic patterning .
a key factor influencing mrna stability and poly(a ) tail length in drosophila embryos is smaug ( smg ) .
smg negatively regulates nos translation by preventing recruitment of active cap - binding complex to the transcript , and it also targets nos mrna for degradation by recruitment of the ccr4 deadenylase complex , a process blocked in the posterior pole plasm by oskar .
expression profiling shows that mrnas representing over half of the drosophila genome ( some 7,700 genes ) are present in mature oocytes . of these ,
approximately 1,600 are degraded upon fertilization . in embryos lacking smg , two - thirds of these mrnas are stabilized . as these mrnas are not enriched for the smg recognition sequence , smg many influence stability of these mrnas in an indirect manner .
the ccr4 deadenylase complex is also recruited to target mrnas by bicaudal - c ( bic - c )   and by nos itself .
interestingly , these factors interact with different subunits of ccr4 : bic - c binds to the not3/5 subunit and nos binds to not4 . puf - domain proteins , typified by pumilio in drosophila , represent another class of negative post - transcriptional regulators ; such proteins recruit ccr4 through its pop2 subunit in yeast . the direct interaction by which smg recruits the ccr4 deadenylase is uncertain , although the not1 subunit was recovered in tandem affinity purification ( tap ) experiments . surprisingly , ccr4 activity is also regulated by a cytoplasmic pool of a predominantly nuclear poly(a)-binding protein , pabp2 , a well - known stimulator of nuclear polyadenylation that with ccr4 targets certain cytoplasmic mrnas for deadenylation during embryonic development .
ccr4-mediated deadenylation is counteracted by poly(a ) polymerases and by orb , the drosophila homologue of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element - binding protein ( cpeb ) , which promotes their recruitment .
interestingly , different poly(a ) polymerases activate expression of specific germline mrnas at different developmental stages .
the poly(a ) polymerase encoded by hiiragi ( hrg ) is required during early stages of oogenesis , whereas that encoded by wispy ( wisp , also known as gld2 ) becomes essential at stage 10 of oogenesis and is required into early embryogenesis .
wisp is required to extend the poly(a ) tail of specific transcripts , such as bicoid , toll , and torso , enabling their subsequent translation , and to stabilize oskar and nos rnas in early embryogenesis .
the c. elegans germline determinant nos-2 is also under translational regulation ; its expression is repressed in the somatic blastomeres of the early embryo .
nos-2 translational activation is the first known molecular event that is specific to the p4 primordial germ cell .
translational repression is maintained in somatic blastomeres by the interaction of four rna - binding proteins ( oma-1 , oma-2 , mex-3 , and spn-4 ) with the nos-2 3 untranslated region ( utr ) . in the p4 cell ,
nos-2 translation becomes de - repressed when pos-1 , another rna - binding protein , outcompetes translational repressors for binding to the nos-2 3 utr .
nos-2 mrna is also targeted by degradation mechanisms in the somatic blastomeres , starting as early as the four - cell stage .
this is dependent on two highly similar zinc finger proteins , mex-5 and mex-6 , and also involves the ccr4 deadenylase .
when the not1 subunit of ccr4 is depleted by rna interference , somatic processing bodies are decreased in number , nos-2 rna is stabilized , and a green fluorescent protein reporter fused to the nos-2 3 utr is translated in somatic blastomeres .
a similar ccr4-mediated mechanism of post - transcriptional regulation was implicated recently in vertebrate germline development as well .
xenopus c3h-4 , a zinc finger protein closely related to pos-1 , recruits ccr4 to shorten the poly(a ) tails of target mrnas that contain a / u - rich elements in their 3 utrs .
key c3h-4 targets are emi1 and emi2 , which encode proteins that inhibit the anaphase - promoting complex that is essential for progression beyond the metaphase i stage of meiosis .
c3h-4 operates in opposition to cpeb , and sequential cycles of polyadenylation and deadenylation of mrnas encoding cell cycle regulators drive progression through meiosis . despite their sequence similarity , c3h-4 and pos-1 have opposing regulatory effects : c3h-4 facilitates deadenylation whereas pos-1 acts to counter translational repression .
also , drosophila bic - c promotes deadenylation or polyadenylation at different developmental stages , through associating with either ccr4 or wisp .
interactions between these rna - binding proteins and different accessory proteins may explain these apparent contradictions ; for example , rna - binding proteins may regulate stability and activity of their targets by influencing whether they associate with processing bodies or germline p granules .
although these particles share many components , germline p granules lack the sm - like ( lsm ) proteins lsm-1 and lsm-3 , whose presence correlates with rna degradation .
together , this work implicates ccr4 as a critical agent of post - transcriptional gene regulation of specific mrnas underlying embryonic patterning .
future work will teach us more about the precise mechanisms by which ccr4 influences target mrnas and whether its recruitment exclusively favors degradation or whether it can result in reversible translational silencing .
also , whereas some of the same rna- and ccr4-binding proteins have been identified in developmental processes in both flies and worms , many thus far have been linked to this system in only one organism .
it will be important to determine whether there is more commonality among ccr4-interacting factors than is presently apparent or whether each system has developed distinct mechanisms to facilitate ccr4-mediated regulation .","Introduction and context

"antidepressants are effective treatments for major depressive disorder ( mdd ) . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) are widely used to treat patients with mdd , and evidence suggests that several ssris are good first - line drugs for treating a current depressive episode.1,2 however , only approximately 30% of patients with mdd treated with the typical ssri citalopram achieved symptomatic remission with the initial pharmacological treatment.3 thus , it is extremely important to investigate alternative treatment strategies , such as switching to another antidepressant , for mdd patients for whom initial ssri treatment failed .
milnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( snri ) that is used for the treatment of mdd in a number of countries .
as the name suggests , milnacipran inhibits both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake through high - affinity transporter binding , with potencies for both serotonin and norepinephrine equivalent to other snris such as venlafaxine and duloxetine.46 results of a previous meta - analysis suggest that switching to another class of antidepressants ( eg , snris ) is better than switching to other ssris in the treatment of patients with ssri - resistant mdd.7 milnacipran s pharmacological profile is different from other snris with regard to its binding affinities , potencies of reuptake inhibition , and transporter selectivity .
specifically , milnacipran has a higher selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter compared to venlafaxine and duloxetine.4,8 there are few studies about the effects of switching patients with mdd to more noradrenergic - selective antidepressants following an initial ssri treatment failure , in terms of not only clinical outcomes of efficacy and safety , but also the exploration of potential biomarkers that could indicate ssri resistance , snri effectiveness , or the likelihood of adverse effects ( aes ) .
one method for identifying putative biomarkers related to treatments for mdd is to measure blood levels of molecules related to inflammation or neuronal function .
we therefore measured the levels of various molecular species from peripheral blood samples , which included interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) , interleukin-8 ( il-8 ) , macrophage inflammatory protein ( mip)-1 , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , serotonin , and the catecholamine metabolites homovanillic acid ( hva ) , 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-hiaa ) , and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol ( mhpg ) .
these were chosen based on information from previous studies.914 the primary aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to milnacipran in patients with mdd following an initial ssri treatment failure .
the secondary aim of this study was to seek potential biomarkers by correlating clinical outcomes and blood levels of molecules that were presumably associated with mdd or its treatment .
this study was conducted from april 2010 to march 2013 . for inclusion criteria to be met , prospective subjects had to be 1 ) aged 2074 years ; 2 ) diagnosed according to the dsm - iv - tr criteria for mdd;15 3 ) unremitted patients treated by an ssri ( paroxetine , fluvoxamine , sertraline , or escitalopram ) for at least 6 weeks prior to this study , and 4 ) with the score of the 17-item hamilton depression rating scale ( hdrs)16 at the baseline was 14 or more . for exclusion criteria to be met ,
potential subjects had to be one of the following : 1 ) treated with selegiline hydrochloride ; 2 ) allergic to milnacipran ; 3 ) suffering from urinary retention ; 4 ) pregnant or breast - feeding ; 5 ) at significant risk of suicide ; 6 ) diagnosed with a primary diagnosis including dementia , bipolar disorder , obsessive  compulsive disorder , eating disorders , or schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders ; and 7 ) dealing with medical conditions judged to make the patient improper for use as a trial subject .
the trial was approved by the institutional review board of chiba university hospital ( chiba , japan ) , and performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the helsinki declaration of 1975 , as revised in 1983 .
the trial was registered on the clinical trials registry of the university hospital medical information network ( umin , tokyo , japan ) under registration number umin000003516 .
all subjects provided written informed consent for their participation in the study after the procedure had been fully explained to them .
titration of the milnacipran dosage was flexible , from 100 to 200 mg , on the basis of the clinical judgment of the treating psychiatrists .
however , the option to decrease the dosage for intolerance remained available . a given participant s visit frequency was every 12 weeks in principle , to assess the safety of milnacipran , up to 8 weeks
the patients were evaluated at the baseline , and then after 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 weeks .
blood samples of the participants were collected from peripheral veins on the same day as the clinical evaluation . to assess the severity of depressive symptoms
response to milnacipran was defined as a 50% reduction in the hdrs score from baseline to each assessment day .
we classified patients as responders , non - responders , and remitters at each point of the study , such that responders and remitters satisfied their respective definitions described earlier , and those patients who satisfied neither the responder nor remitter definitions were classified as non - responders .

japanese version ( qids - srj),18,19 and the clinical global impressions - severity ( cgi - s ) scale.20 to assess social function , we used the japanese version of the social adaptation self - evaluation scale ( sass - j),21 which is a validated self - evaluation scale for assessment of social functioning.22 the hdrs , madrs , qids - srj , sass , and cgi - s scores were measured at the baseline and 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 weeks . in terms of safety , we collected information on all the aes experienced by the participants during this study .
we identified moderate - to - severe aes as effects for which patients underwent medical treatments or were forced to withdraw from this study .
we did not include moderate - to - severe aes which patients experienced , but which required no intervention .
we defined serious aes as those causing death , any life - threatening conditions , hospitalization , or persistent disability .
all blood samples were collected between 10 am and 12 pm , at least 3 hours after breakfast , and were done at the same approximate time for each participant at every visit , although we did not strictly set a diet restriction .
serum samples were rapidly delivered to the department of psychiatry , chiba university graduate school of medicine in anticoagulant tubes at 4c , and stored at 80c until use .
the serum levels of il-6 , il-8 , mip-1 , and bdnf were measured using the respective specific enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay kit ( r&d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) .
plasma 5-hiaa , hva , and mhpg concentrations , as well as whole blood serotonin concentration , were measured by srl inc .
( tokyo , japan ) using their standard laboratory protocols , including evaluation via high - performance liquid chromatography .
reference values provided by srl on the basis of data from more than 100 healthy people were whole blood levels of serotonin , 57230 ( ng / ml ) ; plasma levels of 5-hiaa , 1.06.0 ( ng / ml ) ; hva , 4.415.1 ( ng / ml ) ; and mhpg 3.25.9 ( ng / ml ) ( srl , http://www.srl-group.co.jp/ ) .
platelet counts were conducted at the department of molecular diagnosis of chiba university hospital.23 since platelets store serotonin,24 we calculated platelet serotonin as whole blood serotonin corrected with division by platelet number , to make the adjustment to whole blood serotonin measurements in participants that would be comparable to previous studies.13,25 we first identified the clinical outcomes for participants in this study .
we defined the short - term effectiveness of switching to milnacipran as the effect at the 8-week assessment , according to the convention used in phase iii clinical trials.26 the long - term effectiveness was defined by the result of the 24-week ( final ) assessment .
once the clinical outcomes and their distinct features were determined , we examined the relationships between these data and the data on the assayed blood chemicals to identify potential biomarkers .
we used parametric tests for the values of clinical measures because the data showed normal distribution .
longitudinal efficacy outcomes ( hdrs , madrs , qids - srj , sass - j , and cgi - s ) were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model for repeated measures data with week as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect .
we used non - parametric tests for the values of biological data from blood samples which did not follow a normal distribution . to analyze the changes of molecule levels in blood samples in the same individuals
, we conducted friedman s test to screen for significance , followed by the wilcoxon signed rank test . in comparisons between independent groups for biological values
two - tailed p - values below 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance in all analyses .
all analyses were conducted using spss , version 20.0 ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) .

platelet serotonin levels also significantly increased from baseline in both groups , responders ( n=9 ) ( friedman s test : =21.8 , df=4 , p<0.001 ; the wilcoxon signed rank test : at 4 weeks , z=2.2 , p<0.05 ; at 8 weeks , z=2.5 , p<0.05 ; at 12 and 24 weeks , z=2.7 , p<0.01 ) and non - responders ( n=8 ) ( friedman s test : =16.5 , df=4 , p<0.01 ; the wilcoxon signed rank test : at 8 , 12 , and 24 weeks , z=2.4 , p<0.05 ) , while the levels of the other molecules were not statistically different ( data not shown ) .
first , in terms of efficacy , switching to milnacipran following an initial ssri failure resulted in a 30.0% response rate , and a 23.3% remission rate , at the final assessment of patients with mdd .
second , in terms of safety , all aes occurred in the early period ( up to 4 weeks ) after administration of milnacipran began , and the moderate - to - severe aes were the main reason for withdrawal from this study .
third , this study showed that when moderate - to - severe aes occurred after switching to milnacipran , the baseline serum levels of il-6 and il-8 in patients with them were significantly higher than in patients without them .
fourth , serum levels of mip-1 decreased , and remained decreased throughout the 24-week trial period , in patients with mdd who did not respond to milnacipran .
fifth , whole blood levels of serotonin and platelet serotonin in patients , regardless of responsiveness condition , were increased after switching to milnacipran , and remained increased over the full study duration . switching to milnacipran following
an initial ssri failure resulted in a 30.0% response rate , and a 23.3% remission rate , at the final assessment of patients with mdd in this study .
other studies have examined the efficacy of switching pharmacotherapies following ssri failure . in a representative large sample study ,
the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression ( star*d ) trial,27 switching to other pharmacotherapies or cognitive therapy as the next step in patients with depression whose initial citalopram ( ssri ) treatment failed produced a 27.3% rate of response and a 27.0% rate of remission .
moreover , a recent study reported that the efficacy of switching to the snri venlafaxine in patients whose first antidepressant our results herein are largely consistent with these studies , suggesting that switching to milnacipran could be an optional strategy for patients with mdd following failure of treatment with an ssri or other type of antidepressant .
clearly , though , identifying predictors of treatment responsiveness in the pharmacotherapy of major depression would be a boon to clinical practice .
most aes in this study were considered specific symptoms of inhibiting neuronal nor - epinephrine reuptake29 as snris do by definition .
although previous reports described snris such as milnacipran as comparatively well tolerated,2931 minimizing side effects is important , especially for patients with depression who may have already experienced failure of their initial antidepressant treatments .
establishing means to prevent or prepare for the side effects related to switching pharmacotherapies is needed in clinical practice . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to demonstrate that higher serum levels of il-6 and il-8 at the baseline could be related to adverse clinical effects of an antidepressant treatment in patients with major depression .
however , several previous studies have described relationships between blood levels of cytokines or serotonin at the baseline and therapeutic responses in depressed patients.3235 an inflammatory mechanism is thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression.3638 hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with inflammatory dysregulation in patients with depression.38 moreover , norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as milnacipran enhance noradrenergic action in the synaptic clefts.39 therefore , it seems reasonable that patients with greater inflammation , as reflected by higher serum levels of il-6 and il-8 , may be more likely to suffer from adverse side effects due to administration of noradrenergic antidepressants such as milnacipran
. measurements of serum il-6 and il-8 levels before administration of noradrenergic antidepressants might therefore be useful as predictive biomarkers to guide the direction of further treatment .
this study is also the first to report that serum levels of mip-1 are continuously decreased in non - responsive , but not in responsive , patients with depression after administration of a noradrenergic antidepressant .
mip-1 is a chemokine , or chemotactic cytokine , which is related to the movement of leukocytes to sites of inflammation in injury or inflammatory diseases.40 two in vitro studies have demonstrated that norepinephrine modulates the release of some cytokines from dendritic cells.41,42 although the mechanism behind the decrease in serum mip-1 here is still unknown , switching to milnacipran might directly affect serum mip-1 through its noradrenergic activity . with regard to clinical practice ,
lehto et al reported lower serum levels of mip-1 in patients with depression than in healthy people , a result they ascribed to prolonged depressive symptoms.12 given that our non - responders would have residual and persistent depressive symptoms , our results are compatible with those of the above report .
thus , a change in serum mip-1 levels may represent a monitorable biomarker for responsiveness to treatment with noradrenergic antidepressants such as milnacipran .
serotonin levels were also significantly different following the switch to milnacipran , regardless of responsiveness .
serotonin in the blood is mainly stored in platelets , which acquire the serotonin through cell - surface serotonin transporters.24 ssris and related antidepressants such as tricyclics inhibit serotonin reuptake , and can decrease blood serotonin levels by blocking platelet - mediated storage.32,4346 because milnacipran has lower potency and binding affinity for the serotonin transporter compared to ssris,4,8 it would also increase blood serotonin levels relative to an ssri , as both our data and the abovementioned studies confirmed .
it is possible for ssris to predispose patients to a risk of bleeding through the suppression of platelet function.47,48 moreover , in comparison to other snris , given that the selectivity for the serotonin transporter is relatively higher compared to other snris such as venlafaxine and duloxetine than milnacipran,4,8 milnacipran might not affect bleeding risk better than other snris .
our findings here indicate that milnacipran might be a suitable antidepressant for the treatment of patients with depression who may also be at risk for bleeding problems .
in addition , the data herein also demonstrated that the baseline whole blood levels of serotonin were different between patients with and without moderate - to - severe aes after switching to milnacipran treatment .
however , this result is difficult to interpret , because both the baseline levels in patients with and without moderate - to - severe aes were remarkably lower than the reference values of whole blood serotonin related to prior ssri treatments.32,4346 to clarify this relationship in milnacipran treatment , studies excluding patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitor - based antidepressants will need to be designed .
to confirm our findings , especially those regarding efficacy and safety in switching to milnacipran treatment , a rigorous study including control groups ( placebo and/or other antidepressants ) , randomized assignments , and double - blind assessments must be performed .
further studies with a larger sample are needed to establish not only the clinical effects , but also to verify the current potential biomarkers and identify new ones .
third , the relationships between our putative biomarkers ( il-6 , il-8 , and mip-1 ) and the clinical outcomes are thus far limited to those related to switching to an snri in patients with depression who were treated with an ssri first .
whether these biomarkers can be generalized to other snris or other treatment regimens remains to be seen .
indeed , the utility of these biomarkers is a key question requiring further studies , such as those including other noradrenergic antidepressants and/or a patient cohort with no prior ssri exposure .
this study showed that switching to milnacipran is a potentially effective strategy in the pharmacological treatment of patients with depression following the failure to respond to an initial ssri .
moreover , our study identified serum levels of il-6 , il-8 , and mip-1 as potential blood biomarkers that could be utilized to identify the responsiveness of patients to snris such as milnacipran , or to identify those patients who may experience aes strong enough to warrant discontinuation of treatment .","Introduction

"obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally , with more than 1.4 billion adults overweight200 million men and nearly 300 million women obese  and is a major contributor to the global burden of chronic disease and disability . often coexisting in developing countries with undernutrition ,
obesity is a complex condition , with serious social and psychological dimensions , affecting virtually all ages and socioeconomic groups .
india is undergoing an epidemiologic transition in which chronic conditions replace communicable disease as major causes of morbidity and death .
evidence indicates that adiposity is increasing in india that it is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) ; and that mortality from these conditions is increasing .
obesity is a particular concern , both as a risk factor for cvd and for the development of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and hypertension ( htn ) .
obesity has reached epidemic proportions in india in the 21 century , with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the country 's population .
. national family health survey ( nfhs-3 , 20052006 ) shows around 15% of women and 12% men are overweight or obese . although the proportions of obese are more in urban population , the rural population is not far behind .
secondary as well as primary prevention is an essential part of primary care physician 's work in accordance with the current recommendations .
the primary care physician is in a unique position of influence , which may lead to the adoption of healthy lifestyles and prevent obesity .
advice from the family physician ( fp ) may prompt weight loss attempts and may encourage other health - promoting behaviors .
fps awareness and diagnosis of the obese and overweight is low and may contribute to its undermanagement .
there is also reluctance to treat patients without comorbidities , as there is to treat the overweight as opposed to the obese . in an era of rapidly growing prevalence of obesity ,
the study participants were primary care physicians of health and family welfare department , designated as medical officers ( mos ) of health , working at rural primary health centers of three districts in north karnataka .
the list of primary care physicians working in rural primary health centers was obtained from the district health office .
self - administered questionnaire was developed by a review of literature in the field and it was validated with five mos for scope , length , and clarity .
the questionnaire comprised gps knowledge , attitudes , and practices regarding managing and preventing overweight and obesity and designed to be completed in 1015 min .
the completed questionnaires were hand - checked for completeness and coded before data entry . as the primary aim of this study was to find out the knowledge , attitudes , and practices of gps ; the data was examined by simple frequency counts .

out of 102 , 94 ( response rate 92.2% ) participants responded to questions on cutoff body mass index ( bmi ) value for overweight and obesity .
only 25 ( 26.6% ) and 12 ( 12.8% ) participants indicated appropriate bmi cutoff values for overweight and obesity diagnosis , whereas , 32 ( 34% ) and 35 ( 37.2% ) participants had no idea about this , respectively .
out of 102 participants , 54 responded that they were not aware of the guidelines for obesity management .

non - adherence to lifestyle modification ( 9% ) , food taboos ( 8% ) , lack of motivation ( 22% ) , lack of knowledge towards obesity ( 13% ) , and comorbidities ( 3% ) were the barriers / problems encountered in managing overweight / obese persons .
majority of the participants advice their patients to increase physical activity ( 97% ) , restrict fat ( 97% ) , restrict sugar intake ( 85% ) , increase fruits and vegetable consumption ( 90% ) , reduce red meat ( 81% ) , and avoid alcohol consumption ( 90% ) .
two - thirds of the participants ( 66% ) refer their patients for dietician 's advice and quarter of them ( 26% ) refers to alternative system of medicine .

obesity is emerging as an important health problem in india , paradoxically coexisting with undernutrition .
many of the primary care physicians were unaware about the epidemiological burden of obesity and overweight in india .
the rising prevalence of obesity is associated with the increasing prevalence of non communicable diseases like htn , type 2 dm ( t2 dm ) , and cvd .
htn , dm , and cvds was indicated in 5875% of the participants as major comorbidities associated with obesity and only few of them ( 8% ) were unaware about these comorbidities .
striking finding was majority of the participants were unaware about the cutoff values of bmi for diagnosing the person as overweight / obese .
moreover half of the participants reported that they were not aware of the guidelines for obesity management ; however , many of them indicated decreasing the calorie intake and increasing physical activity as the two most common guidelines .
nearly all of them felt that the adults with bmi within the healthy range should be encouraged to maintain their weight , and three - fourth of them agreed that most overweight persons should be treated for weight loss and small weight loss can achieve major medical benefit .
however , nearly half of the participants responses were stereotypical as they felt only obese and overweight with comorbidities should be treated for weight loss .
nearly two - thirds of them had a perception that overweight / obese are generally lazier and almost half of them felt that such individuals lack willpower and motivation .
most of physicians agreed that doctors should maintain ideal body weight and slightly more than half of them felt that they are professionally competent to treat overweight / obese .
previous studies in other countries have shown that gps do not appropriately evaluate and manage overweight and obesity satisfactorily .
two - thirds of them use bmi to diagnose overweight / obese and nearly all of them advice their patients to increase physical activity and restrict fat . in a study , gps were advising less than one - third of obese patients to lose weight .
most of the participants were advising their patients to restrict sugar intake , increase fruits and vegetable consumption , reduce red meat , and avoid alcohol consumption .
interestingly , two - thirds of the participants refer their patients for dietician 's advice and quarter of them to alternative system of medicine .
the present study assessed the knowledge , attitude , and practices towards obesity among primary care physicians working in rural health centers .
our results clearly indicate lack of knowledge regarding epidemiological burden and about guidelines for evaluating and managing obesity among primary care physicians . though the perceptions and practices of the gps were encouraging and promising , many of the responses were stereotypical and not consistent .
this study has some limitations ; we collected self - reported practices from the participants which were not validated with patient responses or outcomes , included only public sector gps .
as per our knowledge , this is a first ever attempt in india in this regard .
we recommend structured in - service training to primary care physicians to further improve their knowledge and practices towards management of overweight and obesity .","Introduction

"according to the centers for disease control , trauma - related injuries remain a leading cause of death each year in the united states . it is imperative , therefore , to evaluate mortality rates due to trauma in a myriad of ways in order to understand trends and ultimately deliver the highest quality medical care to patients .
much of the research on trauma patient outcomes has focused on patient load or the american college of surgeons ( acs ) trauma center designation . in general ,
level i trauma centers , as compared to levels ii , iii , and iv trauma centers , have demonstrated better outcomes when treating patients of equally severe injuries . a number of studies have looked at survival patterns and outcomes in patients presenting to the hospital during  off - hours ,  defined as either weekends or nights.[48 ] these studies have demonstrated worse outcomes and generally higher mortality rates at night and/or during weekends in patient cohorts defined by selected medical conditions , including acute myocardial infarction , ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke , and aortic aneurysm .
this study used a large trauma database to determine whether trauma patients presenting during the night would have higher in - hospital mortality than similar patients arriving during the day , after controlling for multiple covariates including trauma center level .
it was hypothesized that trauma patients presenting during the night would have higher in - hospital mortality rates than similar patients arriving during the day .
data were obtained from the national trauma data bank ( ntdb ) version 7.0 , which includes 1,860,758 patients admitted to emergency departments in the united states from 2002 to 2006 .
the target population for this study were patients 18 years of age or older with no evidence that they were transferred to or from that center . patients transferred into or from another hospital were excluded from the population of interest because of a primary intent to evaluate the effect of arrival time on mortality .
patients meeting the above criteria were excluded if there was no valid : ( 1 ) in - hospital mortality status , ( 2 ) arrival time information , ( 3 ) injury severity score ( iss ) , or ( 4 ) acs - designation of trauma level .
additional variables of interest included patient age , race ( white , black , hispanic , other ) , gender , deyo - charlson comorbidity index , hospital region ( northeast , midwest , south , west ) , and year patient was admitted . rather than exclude patients from the sample because of missing values for any of these variables , all missing values were coded as not specified and included in the analyses .
this retrospective study was designed to evaluate the association of hospital arrival time and trauma center level with in - hospital mortality .
it was hypothesized that patients who arrived in the evening ( 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. ) or late night ( 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. ) would have higher in - hospital mortality rates than patients arriving during the day ( 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. ) .
it was further hypothesized that this association would be stronger in lower level trauma centers compared to higher level trauma centers , since lower level trauma centers were considered less likely to have the same capabilities in terms of equipment and staff availability .
preliminary analyses were performed to : ( 1 ) describe the effects of applying the exclusion criteria on the study sample by comparing personal and health demographics from the target population who did or did not remain in the study sample due to exclusion criteria ; ( 2 ) describe the sample population ; and ( 3 ) explore the relationships between arrival time and trauma center level and the covariate set .
the primary analyses investigated the association of arrival time and trauma center level on in - hospital mortality within the generalized linear model analysis framework .
poisson regression techniques ( a generalized linear model specifying a poisson distribution with a log link ) were used to determine the relative risk ( rr ) and adjusted relative risk ( arr ) of in - hospital mortality associated with patient arrival time and trauma level .
adjusting factors included patient personal and health demographics , iss , and general factors ( region of the country and year of admission ) .
these were used to interpret differences in mortality rates associated with arrival time and trauma center level , as well as mortality rate differences associated with arrival time within each trauma center level ( i.e. , simple effect associated with an arrival time by trauma center level interaction ) .

of the 1,860,758 patients in the ntdb 7.0 , 1,050,618(56.5% ) were 18 years or older and not coded as having been transferred to or from the hospital .
an examination of the acs - designated trauma level coding indicated 838,284 of the 1,050,618 patients ( 79.8% ) had a valid trauma level .
of these , 59.5% were level i , 37.0% level ii , 3.3% level iii , and 0.2% level iv trauma centers . level
iii and level iv trauma centers were thus grouped together due to the relatively small sizes of each individually . in total , 601,388 or 71.7% of the eligible 838,284 patients
were retained after excluding patients who did not have valid : mortality data ( 8591 ; 1.0% ) , time of arrival data ( 208,736 ; 24.9% ) , or iss ( 19,569 ; 2.3% ) .
table 1 summarizes the relationship of the primary variables of interest and the categorical covariates relative to the mortality outcome , as well as the relationships between the primary variables of interest and the covariates .

comparison of arrival time and trauma center level with each other and selected categorical patient and hospital demographics differences in mortality across arrival time ranged from 4.6 to 4.9% . for trauma center levels ,
the mortality rates were highest at level 1(5.0% ) and lowest at levels iii / iv combined ( 3.1% ) .
the levels i , ii , and iii / iv mortality levels for patients seen at night were 5.1% , 4.6% , and 3.4% , compared to day , which were 5.0% , 4.3% , and 2.9% , respectively .
the average age was in the mid 40s , with those who died older than those who survived .
as expected , the iss was significantly higher ( 27.5 vs. 8.9 ) and the deyo - charlson comorbidity index was slightly higher in the in - hospital mortality group compared to the survival group .

those who arrived at night were significantly younger than those who arrived at other times of the day .
day arrivals were an average 5 years older than those arriving in the evening and more than 10 years older than those arriving late at night .
iss and deyo - charlson comorbidity scores were relatively similar across the four time intervals .
relationship of continuous covariates with arrival time and trauma center level relative to trauma center level , level i patients were : ( 1 ) younger than patients seen at other levels ; ( 2 ) had a higher iss compared to the level ii and level iii / iv centers ( 10.3 vs. 9.3 and 8.1 , respectively ) ; and ( 3 ) had lower deyo - charlson comorbidity scores , which might be expected given the generally younger age groups seen at level i centers .
table 4 summarizes the relative risks for mortality compared to arrival time and trauma level unadjusted for any other factors and adjusting for patient demographics , health status , injury severity , and general factors of hospital region and year of admission .
summary of unadjusted and adjusted relative risks for mortality related to arrival time and level of the treating trauma center the effects of adjustment on the relative risks strengthened the relationships between arrival time and mortality and weakened the relationships between trauma level and mortality .
the arrs demonstrated substantially higher mortality risks for patients arriving late at night compared to morning ( arr=1.21 , p<0.0001 ) , afternoon ( arr=1.26 , p<0.0001 ) and somewhat higher compared to arrivals during the evening ( arr=1.09 , p<0.0001 ) . similarly , arrs for mortality
were also higher in the evening hours when referenced to the morning and afternoon hours ( arr=1.11 , p<0.004 and arr=1.16 , p<0.0001 , respectively ) . comparing 6 p.m.6 a.m. to 6 a.m.6
furthermore , after adjustment , relative mortality rates were all significantly higher from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. referenced to 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for level i ( arr=1.10 , p<0.0001 ) , level ii
( arr=1.14 , p<0.0001 ) , and for combined level iii / iv ( arr=1.32 , p<0.0001 ) .
thus , although mortality rates were lowest for combined level iii / iv trauma centers , the mortality risk for patients arriving between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. was 32.0% greater than for patients arriving between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.

table 4 summarizes the relative risks for mortality compared to arrival time and trauma level unadjusted for any other factors and adjusting for patient demographics , health status , injury severity , and general factors of hospital region and year of admission .
summary of unadjusted and adjusted relative risks for mortality related to arrival time and level of the treating trauma center the effects of adjustment on the relative risks strengthened the relationships between arrival time and mortality and weakened the relationships between trauma level and mortality .
the arrs demonstrated substantially higher mortality risks for patients arriving late at night compared to morning ( arr=1.21 , p<0.0001 ) , afternoon ( arr=1.26 , p<0.0001 ) and somewhat higher compared to arrivals during the evening ( arr=1.09 , p<0.0001 ) .
similarly , arrs for mortality were also higher in the evening hours when referenced to the morning and afternoon hours ( arr=1.11 , p<0.004 and arr=1.16 , p<0.0001 , respectively ) . comparing 6 p.m.6 a.m. to 6 a.m.6
furthermore , after adjustment , relative mortality rates were all significantly higher from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. referenced to 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for level i ( arr=1.10 , p<0.0001 ) , level ii ( arr=1.14 , p<0.0001 ) , and for combined level iii / iv ( arr=1.32 , p<0.0001 ) .
thus , although mortality rates were lowest for combined level iii / iv trauma centers , the mortality risk for patients arriving between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. was 32.0% greater than for patients arriving between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.
this study investigated the relationships of arrival time , trauma center level , and the interaction between these two factors on in - hospital mortality after adjusting for injury severity and additional patient and hospital factors .
as hypothesized , after adjusting for injury severity , patients health , and other patient and hospital demography , in - hospital mortality was higher when patients arrived at night , with late night arrival demonstrating the greatest in - hospital mortality risk .
the arr of in - hospital mortality was directly related to trauma center level , with the greatest risk of in - hospital mortality at level i trauma centers and the lowest rr at the level iii / iv trauma centers .
these results were expected for unadjusted rr estimates , but were unexpected with risk adjustment .
although risk adjustments did reduce these values , suggesting little difference in mortality rates between level i and ii centers , in - hospital mortality risks were still substantially higher at level i and ii centers compared with levels iii / iv .
this pattern of results may be due , in part , to the much lower overall mortality rates observed at level iii / iv trauma centers ( 3.1% ) compared to level i and ii trauma centers ( 5.0% and 4.4% , respectively ) .
although these rates are not large in absolute difference , as a ratio , 5.04/3.11 and 4.11/3.11 represent rates that are 62% and 43% higher at level i and level ii centers compared with level iii / iv centers .
the case mix adjustment variables available may not have been sufficient to adequately  level the playing field  when comparing across trauma center levels without regard to a particular patient cohort .
this is a potential limitation of this study as the literature has generally reported that level i trauma centers have superior in - hospital survival rates compared to hospitals with lower level trauma center designations .
furthermore , limitations associated with the use of the ntdb have been previously published . in general
, these limitations include the fact that this was a retrospective database study with all of the problems inherent with this methodology .
thus , 
 the ntdb version 7.0 may not contain a number of important data elements that might better adjust for case mix across the trauma center levels.level iii and iv trauma centers may be underrepresented in the database.some of the variables of particular interest were notable not by their absence , but by their lack of response . for example , in this study a large number of patients were excluded because the data base did not include the hospital trauma center level and/or patient arrival time.the ntdb does not provide information about day of the week , which limited our ability to further evaluate in - hospital mortality based on weekday or weekend status.data entry is voluntary at participating hospitals and , therefore , may not reflect the actual number of trauma patients seen at an institution .
further , the ntdb provides no weighting information that would allow the user to estimate national incidence rates .

further , the ntdb provides no weighting information that would allow the user to estimate national incidence rates .
the comparison between arrival time and trauma center level was evaluated by comparing night and day in - hospital mortality separately within each trauma center level . here
the adjustment factors strengthened the risk estimates , with nighttime in - hospital mortalities increased from level i ( 10% ) to level ii ( 14% ) to level iii / iv ( 32% ) .
it is important to note that patients presenting to the hospital throughout the entire 24-h period sustained relatively equally severe injuries .
although both the iss and deyo - charlson comorbidity index scores demonstrated statistical significance across the four time blocks , the observed mean differences across the four time blocks ( 10.3 , 9.7 , 9.6 , and 9.9 ) and ( 0.12 , 0.15 , 0.14 , and 0.14 ) , respectively , were not considered clinically important , especially since the variances associated with these means were also quite similar .
this finding is similar to the two studies performed by guly et al . and carmody et al .
in which statistically , but not clinically significant higher iss correlated with weekend and nighttime admissions .
one potential cause for the disparity in mortality rates between night and day could be that physicians and staff are more tired at night and perhaps more likely to make an error .
disruption of circadian rhythms and its effect on performance have been reported in shift workers , with performance declines observed at night relative to day . yet ,
an independent study on emergency room physicians did not find any decline in functional outcomes for patients when nightshifts were compared to dayshifts , although a small increase in early mortality was detected .
another possibility may be that hospitals are simply understaffed at night . as discussed in the carmody study , many hospitals have linearly arranged shifts , with equal numbers of house staff working at night as compared to day , when in fact more patients are admitted at night . a study performed by vaziri et al . demonstrated a sine wave appearance to admissions at hospital emergency departments , showing that there were fewest admissions around 6 a.m. and the most admissions around 7 p.m. appropriate allocation of resources should reflect these patterns .
as indicated throughout this paper , the large sample sizes afforded studies using large databases makes it important to distinguish between statistically significant and clinically important results .
although all of the variables in this study demonstrated statistically significant relationships with in - hospital mortality , many of the observed differences were relatively small . at level i trauma centers ,
patients arriving at night had a 5.1% in - hospital mortality rate and a rr of 1.1 .
this means that patients arriving at night had a 10% higher mortality rate than patients who arrived during the day .
if there were no increased risk of in - hospital mortality at night , then per 1000 patients who arrive at night , the number of in - hospital deaths would be expected to decrease by 5 patients . by these same calculations , for level ii trauma centers  where night mortality rates were 4.6the number of in - hospital deaths per 1000 patients seen at night would be expected to decrease by 6 patients . for level iii / iv trauma centers  where night mortality rates were 3.4%the number of in - hospital deaths per 1000 patients seen at night would be expected to decrease by 8 patients .
some might argue that these different relative risks across trauma level centers suggest that higher - level trauma centers may allocate resources throughout the day more appropriately .
others might say that the consequences of 5 vs. 6 vs. 8 additional lives saved per 1000 patients seen at night is not a large enough benefit to consider making changes in - hospital staffing among the trauma centers to maximize allocation of resources throughout the 24-h day .
strengths of this study include large patient numbers , the ability to limit the cohort to patients who were seen at the original trauma center where they arrived , and a large number of patient personal , health , and injury demographics useful for adjusting for case mix across trauma center levels .
as hypothesized , in - hospital mortality rates were related to arrival time , with night arrivals having higher in - hospital mortality rates compared to day arrivals . however , in this patient population , defined simply as all adults 18 years or older who were treated at the hospital where they were originally seen , the magnitude of the higher risks for in - hospital mortality at night did not translate into substantially higher numbers of lives lost .
this result is due , in part , to the generally low overall in - hospital mortality rates for this general patient population at all trauma centers .
further studies evaluating differential in - hospital mortality risk after traumas based on hospital arrival time could focus on more specific patient cohorts .","INTRODUCTION

, it is currently estimated that over 60% of all human infections treated by physicians are due to biofilms ( fux , costerton and stewart 2005 ) , examples being oral biofilms (  dental plaque ) and biofilms involved in a variety of pathological conditions like for instance osteomyelitis , chronic otitis media , the infected diabetic foot , chronic bacterial prostatitis or in biomaterial - associated infections ( costerton , stewart and greenberg 1999 ; busscher et  al . ,  2012 ) .
accordingly , research is focused mostly on how to prevent and control formation of an infectious , pathogenic biofilm , and on how to keep the commensal microflora of the skin , urinary and intestinal tract or oral cavity intact and free of potential pathogens ( reid et  al . , 
2011 ) . in their biofilm mode of growth , bacteria adhering to a substratum surface and co - adhering with each other ( kolenbrander et  al . , 
this matrix not only yields bacterial phenotypes that can be different from their planktonic counterparts , but also offers physical protection against mechanical and chemical challenges ( flemming and wingender 2010 ) .
biofilm formation starts with the adhesion of bacteria to a substratum surface that can either be of biological or synthetic origin .
this layer of initially adhering bacteria provides a link connecting other bacteria that either grow or adhere on top of it to the substratum surface ( bos , van der mei and busscher 1999 ) .
biofilms can be mechanically challenged during growth , for instance by water pressure in marine environments , industrial pipelines or membrane filtration , in the oral cavity during fluid flow arising from powered toothbrushing and tongue movement , from pulsatile blood flow in intravascular catheters or from the movement of tissues , fluid and biomaterial components in an orthopedic joint prosthesis . when mechanical challenges occur ( fig .
1a ) and detachment forces acting on a biofilm exceed the forces acting between different organisms in a biofilm , the biofilm is overloaded and failure occurs in the biofilm (  cohesive failure ) . alternatively ,
when detachment forces operate exceeding the forces by which the initially adhering organisms connect with a substratum surface , the entire biofilm dislodges from the substratum surface (  adhesive failure ) ( towler et  al . ,  2003 ) .
often biofilms go through cycles of fluctuating mechanical challenges , and cohesive or adhesive failure along with growth occur accordingly .
( a ) structure and composition govern biofilm resistance to environmental detachment and deformation forces .
resistance to deformation can be a time - dependent process yielding relaxation to an original shape over time .
( b ) structure and composition govern the resistance of biofilms against chemical challenge in combination with altered phenotypes that are intrinsically more resistant to antimicrobials .
( c ) composition and structure are jointly reflected in the viscoelasticity of a biofilm .
elasticity is generally presented as a spring with spring constant e , while the viscosity  ( or its inverse , the fluidity  ) is shown as a dashpot .
springs and dashpots can be arranged in series ( named  maxwell element ) or in parallel ( called  kelvin  voigt element ) .
springs react immediately to an applied force , while dashpots dampen the speed of reaction .
usually , biological materials like biofilms can not be represented by a single combination of springs and dashpots .
the biofilm mode of growth protects individual bacteria from a variety of environmental challenges , including chemically diverse biocides ( mah and o'toole 2001 ) , host immune responses and antimicrobials ( vu et  al . ,  2009 ) .
poor antimicrobial penetration is the major obstacle for treating biofilm infections with antibiotics and this has been known since van leeuwenhoek ( van leeuwenhoek 1684 ) reported in the 17th century that  the vinegar with which i washt my teeth , kill'd only those animals which were on the outside of the scurf , but did not pass thro the whole substance of it. although it has become clear in the meantime that the protection offered by biofilms to its inhabitants against chemical challenges consists of multiple mechanisms working in tandem , the exact mechanism is still not fully understood ( ito et  al . ,  2009 ) .
in fig . 1b , we identify three key properties of biofilms that govern the mechanisms through which biofilms become recalcitrant to antimicrobials ( thomas and nakaishi 2006 ; aslam 2008 ; lazar and chifiriuc 2010 ; eastman et  al .
biofilm structure determines many transport processes within a biofilm and can lead to micro - environments with specific ph or nutrient availability ( koo , falsetta and klein 2013 ) . penetration of antimicrobials and nutrients into a biofilm depends on the degree of channelization of the biofilm and the presence of a suitable medium for molecular transport through the biofilm .
usually transport of antimicrobials and nutrients is limited , based on whether the composition of the eps matrix and the bacterial cell surfaces adsorb these compounds .
importantly , biofilm structure is dynamic , adapting in both space and time to its environmental conditions ( donlan 2002 ) , amongst which are ph , temperature , fluid shear , nutrient availability and host defenses . as a result of nutrient deprivation , bacterial phenotypes in a biofilm
can alter , leading to formation of persister cells ( lopez , vlamakis and kolter 2010 ; poole 2012 ) that can remain dormant without causing disease for prolonged periods of time . moreover , many antimicrobial agents target macromolecule synthesis inside bacteria ( dodds , grobe and stewart 2000 ) during active metabolism .
thus , the presence of a slow metabolism contributes to antimicrobial recalcitrance of biofilms in general , and persister cells can tolerate higher concentrations of antimicrobials than nearby recalcitrant biofilm organisms ( spoering and lewis 2001 ; keren et  al . ,  2004 ) .
consequently , whereas planktonic organisms have ample access to nutrients and , by the same token , are highly susceptible to antimicrobials , structural and compositional features of a biofilm form the major impediments for nutrient deprivation , the development of altered phenotypes and antimicrobial recalcitrance . in this review
, we advocate that through a relation between structure and composition of biofilms with their viscoelasticity ( fig .
1c ) , viscoelasticity of biofilms can be recognized as a reflection of their structure and composition , including the eps matrix and bacterial interactions . using stress relaxation analysis , macroscopic physical properties of a biofilm
can be derived that facilitate explanation of the resistance of biofilms in ancient and modern environments as well as of infectious biofilms to mechanical and chemical challenges on a more quantitative basis than can be obtained by microscopic means .
finally , this review identifies new pathways for the treatment of infectious bacterial biofilms by interfering with their viscoelastic properties .
to understand the implications of viscoelasticity as a contributing factor to the resistance of biofilms to mechanical and chemical challenges , we first give a comprehensive description of the concept of viscoelasticity ( for an excellent introduction to biomechanics including the viscoelasticity of materials see vincent ( 2012 ) ) .
 viscoelasticity is a material property in which a material exhibits both viscous and elastic characteristics .
viscous materials deform irreversibly over time to relieve stress , while elastic materials deform instantaneously to relieve stress and come back to their original state once stress is removed .
a viscoelastic material will deform under stress , while returning over time to a state similar to , but not necessarily identical to the pre - deformed state , when stress is removed . whereas elasticity is usually the result of atomic or molecular stretching
, viscosity is the result of  atomic or molecular flow  ( ratner et  al .
,  2004b). elasticity is generally presented as a spring with spring constant e , while the viscosity  ( or its inverse , the fluidity  ) is shown as a dashpot .
a spring reacts to an applied force with an immediate change in length , depending on the magnitude of the force applied , but this is different for a dashpot .
a dashpot behaves like a piston that is free to move up and down a cylindrical vessel filled with a fluid , provided the fluid can flow through the piston - cylinder gap .
thus , the speed at which the piston can move heavily depends on the viscosity of the fluid . spring and dashpot can either be placed in series or in parallel ( see fig .
note that biological materials usually can not be represented by a single combination of a spring and dashpot .
table 1 provides examples of values for the elasticity and viscosity of some known , biological and synthetic materials , including biofilms .
viscoelasticity of different biological and synthetic materials , including the elasticity or bulk modulus e and the viscosity  at room temperature ( 20c ) , unless stated otherwise .
microscopic techniques , and particularly confocal laser scanning microscopy ( clsm ) , have yielded a general description of biofilm structure and to a limited degree its microbiological and biochemical composition .
whereas early electron microscopic techniques enabled imaging of organisms in a biofilm , the desiccation required by high - vacuum conditions has long obscured the role of the eps matrix that appeared as a dark rim of condensed matter on the bacterial cell surfaces in a biofilm ( stewart and costerton 2001 ) . improved preservation methods such as cryopreservation prevent condensation of the eps matrix ( matias et  al .
these sections can be reconstructed into 3d volumes , providing highly detailed insights into biofilm structure .
focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy ( fib - sem ) , for instance , uses ion - sputtering of biofilm mass with repetitive imaging to observe the organisms within biofilms at high resolution ( wallace , arey and mahaffee 2011 ) , and 2d images selected from a 3d image stack can be utilized to visualize cell wall damage inside a biofilm due to antimicrobial attack ( see fig .
due to requirements of some degree of preservation , these electron microscopy techniques are often susceptible to corruption of the natural state of biofilms ( wu et  al . ,  2014 ) .
environmental sem has the advantage that it does not require dehydration or fixation , but it can not see inside the highly hydrated eps to reveal internal structure ( danilatos and postle 1982 ; bridier , meylheuc and briandet 2013 ) .

many key components of biofilm structure have been determined using clsm in association with chemically binding fluorophores , including 3d architecture ( salek , jones and martinuzzi 2009 ; uppuluri , chaturvedi and lopez - ribot 2009 ; robinson 2011 ) , mushroom - shaped colonies ( entcheva - dimitrov and spormann 2004 ; venugopalan et  al . ,  2005 ) , stratification ( lawrence et  al . ,  1991 ) , establishment of water channels ( donlan 2002 ; stewart 2012 ) , presence of eps ( sanford et  al . ,  1996 ; lawrence et  al . ,  2003 ;
li , bai and liu 2008 ) , bacterial cell surface damage and viability ( hope , clements and wilson 2002 ) as well as biofilm failure under compression ( cense et  al . ,  2006 ) .
the establishment of water channels , however , has never been directly proven by clsm methods , but rather indirectly indicated by the absence of stain uptake as by bacteria and matrix components .
chemically reactive lectins provide information about the molecular composition of sugars within a biofilm ( allison 2003 ) .
fish ) differentially stains individual cells of different bacterial species , providing information about the location of different species within multispecies biofilms ( weber et  al . ,  2007 ) .
clsm also has the advantage of allowing real - time imaging of localized processes of attachment , growth and dispersal as well as metabolic activity and flow through the biofilm .
a limiting factor in the use of clsm is that the penetration ability of the fluorophores is typically confined to 20 to 40 m ( vroom et  al .
,  1999 ) , and it is difficult to see much deeper within a biofilm structure .
moreover , the penetration capability of the laser itself limits the depth of view within a biofilm structure .
two - photon laser systems have helped to increase the penetration depth of the clsm imaging , yet they still require the use of fluorophores that may have harmful effects to the biofilms ( mclean , ona and majors 2008 ) . these drawbacks of clsm have stimulated the use of other microscopic techniques that image biofilm structure but do not rely on staining .
optical coherence tomography , for instance , relies on the scattering of light rather than on fluorescent staining and is used to accurately describe voids and water channels ( wagner et  al . ,  2010 ) .
water channels have been indirectly indicated by clsm methods , assuming that they correspond with voids , but clsm easily overestimates the presence of voids , because they also appear due to lack of stain penetration .
optical coherence tomography , not relying on stain penetration , has demonstrated that heterotrophic biofilms had a porosity under 70% , when 98% porosity was found using clsm ( wagner et  al . ,  2010 ) . in summary , advances in microscopic imaging techniques have yielded structural information on voids and water channels in biofilms and their compositional heterogeneity .
however , in essence , these advances still reflect a similar conclusion as drawn in the 17th century , when antonie van leeuwenhoek reported on the poor penetration of vinegar into oral biofilm using his first , self - made microscopes ( van leeuwenhoek 1684 ) .
this calls for an urgent need for more quantitative , observer - independent techniques to characterize biofilms in terms of structure and composition .
measurement of the viscoelasticity of a biofilm either involves measuring deformation under constant stress (  creep ) ( lau et  al . , 
2009 ) in either a compressive , shear or tensile mode or measuring the stress required to maintain a constant deformation (  stress relaxation ) ( cense et  al . ,  2006 ) , as summarized in fig .
strain ) can , amongst other methods , be applied by uniaxial compression ( krstgens et  al . , 
2001 ) , in which a macroscopic plunger mechanically stresses or deforms the biofilm and strain or stress relaxation is recorded as a function of time . since relaxation results from multiple re - arrangement processes in a deformed biofilm ,
although creep is the increase of strain under an imposed load and stress relaxation is the dissipation of stress under an imposed strain ( gupta et  al . ,  2010 )
, their measurement can be analyzed using similar mathematical models , which result in similar time constants of their response processes ( poznanski , pawlowski and fikus 1992 ) .
generally , due to its multi - component nature , stress relaxation of biofilms can be described by three to four maxwell or kelvin 
1c ) with each element containing a dashpot , responsible of a single time - dependent re - arrangement process , combined with a spring constant , representing the immediate elastic response . note that in a kelvin 
voigt element , dashpot and spring are placed in parallel , causing dampening of the immediate response as immediate relaxation has to occur against the action of the dashpot . in a maxwell model ( fig .
3c ) , multiple maxwell elements are placed in parallel , while in a burgers model a kelvin 
voigt element is placed between the spring and dashpot of a maxwell element ( fig .
however , the more elements one includes , the better the fit but the more uncertainty in the values of the parameters derived will occur .
the creep response commonly found in biofilms may require a minimum of four elements ( jones et  al . ,  2011 ) .
viscoelastic measurements of  creep and  stress relaxation. ( a ) during creep measurements , a constant stress is induced while the deformation of the biofilm is recorded over time .
( b ) during stress relaxation measurements , a constant deformation is induced and the stress required to maintain that deformation is recorded over time .
( c ) in a maxwell model , response to an induced stress or deformation is mathematically modeled using multiple maxwell elements in parallel , each with their characteristic time constants representing the viscous part of the response (  the dashpots , n ) and an immediate elastic response component (  the springs , en ) . characteristics time constants of each individual response process follow from n as indicated in the graph .
( d ) in a burger 's model , this response is mathematically modeled using a kelvin 
voigt element separated by a spring and dashpot , that together represent a maxwell element . using microbead atomic force microscopy , relaxation processes in a biofilm
can also be monitored on a more microscopic level ( lau et  al . ,  2009 ) .
often , the microbead is comprised of a silica particle with a diameter typically in the order of up to 50 m .
stress deformation of pseudomonas biofilms using microbead atomic force microscopy yielded relaxation times of less than 1 s , with a reduced viscoelastic response in more matured biofilms of pseudomonas strains deficient in lipopolysaccharides .
individual bonds between single bacteria are also viscoelastic in nature and bacterial probe atomic force microscopy has revealed relaxation times for a variety of gram - negative bacterial strains between 0.8 and 2.6 s based on a three - element standard solid model ( vadillo - rodriguez and dutcher 2011 ) .
relaxation times of gram - positive staphylococcal bonds were slightly higher between 1 and 6 s and shorter in absence of an eps matrix around the bacteria ( chen et  al . ,  2014 ) . while indentation and rheometry measure bulk properties of biofilms , microscopy - based techniques can be utilized to measure local viscoelastic properties within a biofilm and in different biofilm structures .
digital image correlation of 2d bright field microscope images of biofilms grown under flow revealed that biofilm deforms differently in response to elevations in fluid shear in the attached head as compared to in the streamer tail ( mathias and stoodley 2009 ) .
more recently microrheometry using clsm to track the motion of magnetic beads in response to an oscillating magnetic field ( galy et  al . ,  2012 ) or the natural brownian motion of beads within the biofilm ( chew et  al . ,  2014
) have been used to map the viscoelastic properties of biofilms at specific locations in 3d .
( 2012 ) found that some parts of a biofilm behave like elastic solids , while others behave more like viscoelastic liquids and the base of the biofilm was stiffer than the upper layers , illustrating the importance of mechanical heterogeneity .
it was also reported that the local mechanical properties were not related to local cell density , suggesting that the eps was the principal determinant . chew et  al .
( 2014 ) were able to link the mechanical properties of different polymers expressed in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with streamer formation .
optical coherence tomography also has good potential for measuring 3d biofilm structural responses to applied fluid shear stresses ( wagner et  al . ,  2010 ) .
the difficulty in simulating in situ biofilm rheological behavior in the laboratory using pure protein and polysaccharide gels suggests that the rheological complexity is a result of structural and compositional heterogeneity within a biofilm .
the measurement of relaxation processes at a more microscopic level combined with local staining of specific eps components offers the challenging possibility of modeling the macroscopic viscoelasticity of a biofilm in terms of its eps response and the response of individually interacting bacteria . bacteria in a biofilm constitute the heaviest masses ; thus , their re - arrangement upon an induced deformation will be slow , and the relative importance of the slowest maxwell element in relaxation has been intuitively associated with bacterial re - arrangement in a biofilm .
recently , the relatively slow re - arrangement of p. aeruginosa was confirmed by direct microscopic observation of relaxation processes , showing that bacteria could not find new , stable positions within 100 s upon an imposed deformation ( peterson et  al . ,  2014 ) , while eps displaced by deformation moved toward deeper layers within 20 s. in the so - called  fluctuating binding point model ( krstgens et  al . ,  2001 ) , this implies that binding points in a biofilm , existing prior to the application of deformation , can be more readily re - established between eps components than between bacteria or between bacteria with eps components .
water , on the other hand , has the lowest viscosity in a biofilm , and therefore the fastest maxwell element has been associated with the flow of water through a compressed biofilm .
this leaves an association between the behavior of eps with intermediate maxwell element(s ) ( peterson et  al . ,  2012 ; he et  al . ,  2013 ) .
principal component analyses of maxwell elements describing the stress relaxation exhibited by biofilms with different matrix chemistries have pointed out that in general three principal components suffice to describe stress relaxation of biofilms ( peterson et  al . ,  2013 ) .
a second principal component was associated with the eps matrix as a whole , with a distinct impact of the presence of edna included in a third component , possessing a narrowly confined time constant range within the range of the second principal component .
the presence of bacteria themselves as the heaviest masses is included in the first principal component with an inverse impact of bacterial prevalence with respect to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides , i.e. the free space in a biofilm available for bacterial re - arrangement processes ( peterson et  al .
importantly , herewith there exists a relation between quantifiable viscoelastic properties of a biofilm that relates with their structure and composition that goes beyond the possibilities of microscopic imaging techniques .
in their natural environment , most biofilms are exposed to external forces applied either in a compressive , tensile or shear mode . whereas microscopic techniques in general yield semi - quantitative descriptions of structure and composition of a biofilm at best , viscoelasticity is determined by an interplay of structure and composition as outlined above , and can be quantitatively assessed over larger areas of a biofilm than microscopically possible .
. eps alone is a multi - component substance ( whitchurch et  al . ,  2002 ; flemming and wingender 2010 ; koo , falsetta and klein 2013 ) , and , as a consequence , biofilms react in a time - dependent manner with a combination of distinct elastic and viscous responses to external stress .
the elastic part of the response is immediate and followed by viscous relaxation ( klapper et  al . ,  2002 ; stoodley et  al . , 
more specifically , a number of studies suggest that biofilms behave as viscoelastic liquids ( stoodley et  al .
,  1999a ; krstgens et  al . ,  2001 ; towler et  al . ,  2003 ; shaw et  al . ,  2004 ) , i.e. they flow under sustained load , and even though values of the elastic and viscous moduli vary by many orders of magnitude , viscoelasticity is a common feature of many different types of medical , oral and environmental biofilms ( shaw et  al . ,  2004 )
( 2004 ) noticed that despite wide variations in elasticity and viscosity of biofilms , their overall characteristic relaxation time constant was about 18 min over a wide collection of biofilms derived from fresh water and hot spring isolates , staphylococcus aureus , p. aeruginosa and streptococcus mutans strains .
considering that bacterial doubling times in regularly growing biofilms are of the same order of magnitude ( gottenbos et  al . ,  1999 )
, 18 min may represent a possible survival significance as the period over which a biofilm can respond to transient , external stresses ( shaw et  al . ,  2004 ) .
there is evidence that the ability of biofilms to flow along surfaces when exposed to elevated shear of an overlying water stream may allow bacteria to yield to the flow , yet remain attached to the surface .
time lapse images in flow cells captured the flow and the ability of the biofilm to rapidly change ripple and streamer morphology when the water flow was changed ( stoodley et  al . ,  1999b ) .
ripple structures have also been observed in modern streams ( battin et  al . , 
2003 ) as well as ancient fossils ( noffke et  al . ,  2013a ; noffke , decho and stoodley 2013b ; thomas et  al . ,  2013 ) .
energy dissipation through such viscoelastic behavior can also explain the large pressure drops and drag associated with biofilms in systems as diverse as sulfate - reducing bacterial biofilms in industrial pipelines ( dunsmore et  al . ,  2002 ) as well as biofouling of ship hulls ( schultz et  al . ,  2011 )
in addition to survival in natural environments , biofilm viscoelasticity , as a corollary of structure and composition , also has implications for the way pathogenic biofilms deal with mechanical and chemical challenges , particularly when biofilms are associated with biomaterials implants and devices , as will be illustrated in the following sections .
catheter - associated blood stream infections are common after long - term catheterization of patients and result from catheter - associated biofilms .
biofilms on intravascular catheters have to withstand the fluctuating shear from the pulsatile blood flow , using their viscoelastic properties to adjust to local changes in fluid flows while maintaining their structural integrity . in an initial attempt to withstand increasing shear forces ,
biofilms extend in the direction of flow through re - arrangement into so - called 
the viscoelasticity of biofilms allows these streamers the possibility to extend and therewith organisms residing in the biofilm gain time to adapt to the new flow conditions .
recently , it was hypothesized that viscoelastic streamer formation by s. aureus in intravenous catheter may block these catheters ( kim et  al . ,  2014 ) .
however , it is also possible that the formation and breaking of viscoelastic eps tethers allow s. aureus biofilms to roll along catheter surfaces ( rupp , fux and stoodley 2005 ) , much like selectin - mediated leukocyte rolling during extravasation ( sundd , pospieszalska and ley 2013 ) .
recent evidence has suggested that biofilms might be involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and be involved in their detachment ( lanter , sauer and davies 2014 ) .
how and when biofilms in the blood stream fail is arguably the most important biofilm property in an intravascular catheter application ( guelon , mathias and stoodley 2011 ) .

the edge of the streamer has been outlined for clarity and the direction of fluid flow is indicated by the thick arrow [ ( stoodley et  al .

endotracheal tubes are used to intubate patients for breathing and deliver pulsatile flow during a positive pressure inspired delivery and neutral pressure expired release .
the gas is humidified and a moist layer containing respiratory secretions forms on the inner lumen of the tube which rapidly becomes colonized with bacteria from the oral cavity , upper airway and nosocomial hospital pathogens ( vandecandelaere et  al . ,  2013 ) .
bacteria from biofilms on endotracheal tubes can enter the airway to cause ventilator - associated pneumonia through spreading growth , detachment into the gas stream ( inglis et  al . ,  1989 ) . however ,
inglis ( 1993 ) also made the salient observation that endotracheal tube biofilms had formed wave - like structures and hypothesized that these might be caused by biofilm flow along the surface , contributing to ventilator - associated pneumonia .
as discussed previously , time lapse imaging has shown that biofilms can form ripples and flow as viscoelastic liquids induced by the overlying liquid flow ( stoodley et  al . , 
1999b ) with implications for dissemination of pathogens within or from medical devices . in the oral cavity as well as in the blood stream
, biofilms are mechanically challenged by naturally occurring fluid flows , but also by tongue movements and daily toothbrushing .
toothbrushing removes oral biofilm through direct contact with toothbrush filaments , but powered toothbrushes also do so in a non - contact mode ( verkaik et  al . ,  2010 ) , provided the energy output of the brush is high enough ( busscher et  al . ,  2010 ) .
the energy output of powered toothbrushes varies according to distance from the edge of the toothbrush filaments and navigates the complex geometry of tooth surfaces .
thus , removal of oral biofilms via non - contact mode brushing is susceptible to a wide distribution of shear forces ( rmaile et  al . ,  2014 ) .
the viscoelasticity of oral biofilms under non - contact brushing causes the biofilm to expand rather than to directly disperse prior to disruption ( busscher et  al . ,  2010 ) .
moreover , if toothbrushing is arrested before biofilm detachment occurs , biofilms are left in an expanded state ( see fig .
penetration of chlorhexidine into oral biofilms increased with increasing relative importance of the slow and decreasing importance of the fast relaxation element ( see fig .
involvement of slow relaxation elements suggests that biofilm structures allowing extensive bacterial re - arrangement after deformation are more open , allowing better antimicrobial penetration .
involvement of fast relaxation elements suggests that water dilutes the antimicrobial upon penetration to an ineffective concentration in deeper layers of the biofilm ( he et  al . ,  2013 ) .
note that these results could also have been expressed in one principal component , since the more open structure allowing bacterial re - arrangement inversely relates to the presence of water - filled channels ( peterson et  al . ,  2013 ) .
the flow of water through biofilms is an important consideration in terms of antimicrobial penetration to target bacteria in a biofilm .
generally , flow will be primarily from convection ( fast ) and diffusion ( slow ) .
early work with fluorescent microspheres and nano - injection of fluorescent dyes established that an overlying flow induced convective flow in the channels ( stoodley , de beer and lewandowski 1994 ) , while in clusters alone there was only diffusion . larger molecules such as human igg antibody could not penetrate the eps matrix ( debeer , stoodley and lewandowski 1997 ) .
nevertheless , submerged biofilms themselves are highly compressible ( peterson et  al . ,  2012 ) , and since water is incompressible there must be a dewatering effect to explain the biofilm volume decrease . under compression , it is likely that water is squeezed out of the channels , and , while it has not been directly shown whether compression induces convection through the eps matrix of the cell clusters , modeling of the viscoelastic response predicts that there is ( he et  al . ,  2013 ) . squeezing out of water through channels in compressed biofilms
may also constitute the reason as to why biofilm elasticity and viscosity vary when derived in different modes of stress application .
in many experimental systems , biofilms are usually  unconfined and stress is applied locally over a relatively small surface area , allowing water to flow away from the stressed region to its surrounding as is also possible in natural conditions .
in the medical arena , the pathogenicity of bacteria is usually related to conventional definitions of virulence describing virulence factors as molecules that are essential for a pathogen to cause disease .
such factors include molecules that enable the pathogen to colonize the host by attachment to and invasion in host tissue , or to evade the host immune response .
however , with the growing realization that biofilms rather than planktonically present organisms represent the more pathogenic state of bacterial growth , additional factors come into play . in a biofilm ,
bacterial adhesion to a substratum surface causes a phenotypic change that makes removal upon a mechanical challenge more difficult ( vuopio - varkila and schoolnik 1991 ; gonzalez - valencia , munoz and torres 1991 ; pal et  al .
mechanical strategies used by biofilms to persist in the environment which allow part to remain attached , coalesce and flow over surfaces , while other parts detach in response to external mechanical forces , are being seen as playing an important role for persistence of infection ( lieleg et  al . ,  2011 ; stewart 2014 ) .
in addition , structure and composition of the eps matrix of oral biofilms as reflected in the viscoelastic properties of a biofilm , have been related with bacterial activity in a biofilm ( koo , falsetta and klein 2013 ) .
the biofilm mode of growth is also recognized to increase recalcitrance to antimicrobials as a result of diffusion limitation through the biofilm ( arciola , campoccia and montanaro 2002 ; oelschlaeger , dobrindt and hacker 2002 ) .
survival requires structural and compositional re - arrangements to evade these challenges on an appropriate timescale , as represented in the viscoelasticity of a biofilm ( shaw et  al . ,  2004 ) .
the realization that viscoelasticity is a quantifiable reflection of the structure and composition impacting its survival under mechanical or chemical challenge opens new pathways for the control of biofilms in disease and understanding of ill - understood phenomena like the increased susceptibility of biofilms to antibiotics in combination with pulsating waves of energy ( rediske et  al . ,  1998 ) .
the clsm images in fig . 4b clearly demonstrated that biofilms expand upon the transfer of energy by non - contact , powered toothbrushing ( busscher et  al .
this effect was accompanied by an increase in the slow and a decrease in the fast maxwell relaxation of these biofilms .
non - contact , powered toothbrushing is usually done at frequencies between 260 and 750 hz ( blanco et  al . ,  1997 ) .
these frequencies might be aligned in the future with the characteristic time constants or resonance frequencies of the different relaxation processes occurring upon mechanically challenging a biofilm , to increase bacterial detachment .
obviously , the implications of this suggestion reach beyond oral health care , and pertain to all situations where it is desirable or necessary to remove biofilms by mechanical means .
pulsating waves of energy have been shown to amplify antimicrobial efficacy against biofilms , and is generally referred to as the  bio - acoustic effect ( pitt et  al . ,  1994 ; shen et  al . ,  2010 ) .
gentamicin has been shown to have enhanced killing in p. aeruginosa and escherichia coli biofilms in vitro and in vivo in rabbits after ultrasound treatment with frequencies ranging from 30 to 500 khz and energies ranging from 10 to 3000 mw  cm ( qian , stoodley and pitt 1996 ; rediske et  al .
,  2000 ; carmen et  al . ,  2004 , 2005 ) .
although biofilms of gram - positive bacteria were initially thought to be resistant to enhanced killing from ultrasonic waves ( pitt et  al . ,  1994 ) , with enough energy input ( 3000 mw  cm ) gram - positive bacteria were also found to be susceptible ( rediske et  al . ,  1998 ) . reducing the frequency of the wave to
23 hz increased efficacy of antimicrobials in biofilms of s. aureus and single and mixed species oral biofilms ( gerdesmeyer et  al . ,  2005 ;
,  2008 ; muller et  al . ,  2011 ) . since , despite the lower frequencies used in non - contact , powered toothbrushing ( blanco et  al . , 
1997 ) , there is an analogy between non - contact powered toothbrushing with the bio - acoustic effect , it is likely that ultrasound will change the structure of biofilms to cause better penetration of antimicrobials into a biofilm and therewith increased killing .
viscoelastic measurements have not yet been done however on ultrasonically treated biofilms , but such measurements may shed more light on the mechanisms of the bio - acoustic effect .
interestingly , low frequencies were more efficient in increasing the killing efficacy of antimicrobials than higher ones ( qian , sagers and pitt 1999 ) . the characteristic time constants derived from the stress relaxation of deformed biofilms , ranging from < 5 s , 5100 s and > 100 s for the fast , intermediate and slow elements , respectively , suggest that the main effects of pulsating energy waves are through effects on the fast principal maxwell element and thus associated with the presence of water in the biofilm .
at the low frequencies associated with more efficient killing , the pulsating energy waves are closer to cutoff between the frequencies of the fast and intermediate maxwell elements .
taken together , these considerations point to a new pathway to increase the efficacy of pulsating waves of energy by fine - tuning the frequencies of these treatments to the resonance frequencies of the different constituents in biofilm matrices , which will have a major impact on both their mechanical stability and antimicrobial penetration through a direct effect on the viscoelasticity of biofilms .
changes in viscoelastic properties of biofilms that enhance antimicrobial efficacy can not only be achieved through pulsating waves of energy but also chemically ( jones et  al .
after exposure to detergents , s. aureus biofilms grown on stainless steel had increased expression of the slowest maxwell element , reflecting bacterial re - arrangement .
pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on stainless steel were affected by n - acetyl - l - cysteine , as both the fast and intermediate maxwell elements were reduced by more than 50% , while the slowest maxwell element nearly doubled .
pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on membrane filters were similarly affected by both n - acetyl - l - cysteine and dnasei , reducing both the fastest and intermediate principal elements ( peterson et  al . ,  2013 ) .
thus , both the pre - treatment and post - treatment of biofilms by chemicals directly affects their viscoelastic properties and changes them into a direction favorable for subsequent antimicrobial treatment .
bacterial biofilms provide added protection against environmental detachment forces , antimicrobials and the host immune system , increasing the chance of survival under mechanical and chemical attack .
this review identifies the viscoelasticity of biofilms as a corollary of the structure and composition of biofilms .
the viscoelasticity of biofilms therewith becomes a quantifiable property of biofilms , pivotal for the way biofilms deal with mechanical and chemical challenges .
this identification opens new pathways to prevent or control bacterial biofilms by intervening with their viscoelastic properties that may be particularly relevant in the medical arena where over 60% of all human infections are due to biofilms .","INTRODUCTION
